"""On-disk output: results.jsonl (one full trace per line) + config.toml.

The trace is the full data dump — written verbatim, consumed by the platform
(visualization) and prime-rl (training). config.toml is the run's resolved EvalConfig,
written in the same format the CLI reads (`@ config.toml`), so a run is re-runnable from
its own output. Aggregates (avg reward, etc.) are cheap to recompute from results, so
they aren't stored.

The runner writes `config.toml` once up front (`save_config`) and then appends each
trace to `results.jsonl` as it completes (`append_trace`), so a long run's results are
durable as they land rather than only at the end.

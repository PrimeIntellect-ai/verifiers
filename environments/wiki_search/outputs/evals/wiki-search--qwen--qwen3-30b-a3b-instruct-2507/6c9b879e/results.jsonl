Bethesda advertised that the edition would include a [canvas](canvas) [bag](duffel)(duffel bag), but a [nylon](nylon) one was included instead. Responding to customer complaints, Bethesda claimed that the bag had to be changed due to unavailability of materials, and initially stated the intention to take no action. The publisher received criticism for not making the change known beforehand, with *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* pointing out that the bag's description on Bethesda's website had only changed to read \"nylon\" after complaints had been submitted. Bethesda later offered affected customers free in-game currency of 500 atoms as compensation, equivalent to . Critics pointed out this amount of currency was not enough to purchase the in-game postman uniform (700 atoms), which includes a canvas bag. Additionally, it was discovered that Bethesda had produced a different *Fallout 76*\u2013themed canvas bag and given them for free to [influencers](online)(Internet celebrity), further adding to the fan outrage. Bethesda announced on December 3, 2018, that they would be producing canvas bags for all owners of the Power Armor special edition, which were ultimately said to be shipping \"in four to six months.\" In June 2019, the bags were delivered to customers.\n\nA [breach](data)(data breach) occurred on December 5, 2018, when a [glitch](glitch) in Bethesda's [system](support)(Issue tracking system) revealed personal information of approximately 65 *Fallout 76* customers who had submitted a support ticket to receive the canvas bag. Users were able to open and close tickets of other customers and view personal information, including names, addresses, emails and partial credit card information. In a statement given to *[Technica](Ars)(Ars Technica)*, Bethesda said that the breach occurred via \"an error with our customer support website\" and that they are \"investigating the incident and will provide additional updates as we learn more\". The publisher clarified that the only information leaked were details that the support site would have requested, rather than credit card numbers or passwords, and that they would notify all affected customers.\n\nIn 2018, Bethesda partnered with the Silver Screen Bottling Company to create \"Nuka Dark Rum\", an alcoholic beverage based on the in-game \"Nuka-Cola Dark\" introduced in the *[4: Nuka-World](Fallout)(Fallout 4: Nuka-World)* [add-on](Downloadable content). The rum was available to be pre-ordered in August 2018 for . While its release was expected to coincide with the launch of *Fallout 76*, the rum was delayed and was shipped instead in late December 2018. Upon receiving it, fans criticized the fact that the rum bottle advertised, previously expected to be a bottle in the missile-like shape of the in-game Nuka-Cola item, had turned out to be a standard glass bottle encased in a large plastic cover. The rum's asking price of $80 was subsequently condemned from expectations that the design would be of high quality, since none of the marketing had stated what the bottles would be made of.\n\nIn September 2019, collectible \"Nuka Cola\"\u2013themed *Fallout* helmets produced by Chronicle Collectibles, of which only 32 of the 20,000 manufactured were sold, were recalled by the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](U.S.)(U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) due to containing high levels of mold and posing a health risk. No incidents or injuries were reported. [GameStop](GameStop), which sold the helmets, notified all customers who had purchased a helmet and offered them a full refund.\n\nIn June 2022, a *Kotaku* article published reports from ten anonymous former employees of Bethesda and its parent company [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) of severe mismanagement during *Fallout 76*s development. The reports claimed that [crunch](Crunch (video games)) had been enforced, leading to an \"exodus\" of senior developers from the company. The loss of staff led to Bethesda borrowing developers working on [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios)' *[Redfall](Redfall)* and Bethesda's *[Starfield](Starfield (video game))* to assist with *Fallout 76*. Other alleged issues included technical problems with the game's design and engine, as well as these concerns being ignored by senior management. The sources expressed cynicism towards an improvement of working conditions at Bethesda (following their acquisition by Microsoft), saying \"It would be great if something like [ABetterABK](ABK Workers Alliance) existed for Bethesda [...] But everyone is terrified...because [Bethesda] HR is super cutthroat.\"\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The controversy surrounding the Fallout 76 Power Armor edition's physical item centered on the discrepancy between the advertised and actual contents of the special edition.

Both Dacus and Bridgers had opened for Baker on separate tours in 2016, and they all ran in similar circles as young up-and-coming performers navigating the [indie](Independent music) scene.\n\nThe three became close and shared their frustrations of constantly being compared to each other as \"[in rock](women)(women in rock)\" despite their considerably different musical styles. Dacus has commented that the idea of women in music \"should not be remarkable whatsoever,\" with Bridgers adding, \"it's not a genre.\" Each has spoken on the tendency of the music industry to pit women against each other, and the group was formed in part to reject this idea. \"I hope people see the three of us and know there isn't competition,\" Dacus has said. \"You don't have to compete with your contemporaries. You can make something good with people you admire.\"\n\nBaker had joked to Dacus years before about a \"pipe dream\" that they could one day all form a band. The three decided to book a [tour](co-headlining)(Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers with Lucy Dacus Tour) in early 2018, and they originally planned to record a single or a [version](cover)(cover version) so that they could perform something together on stage. Upon meeting up that summer, however, they found themselves overwhelmed with ideas, and they ended up forming the band, writing, recording, and self-producing the *[Boygenius](Boygenius (EP))* [EP](Extended play) in four days, with the process involving almost exclusively women.\n\nEach brought one full song and one incomplete idea with them to the group. They sought to create an environment free of the competitiveness and \"bravado\" they had often encountered in previous experiences, and they have remarked that the absence of adult men in the process proved significant, allowing them to relate to each other openly without constantly having to explain themselves. The record was met with universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike; it was named the 12th best album of 2018 by [Music](NPR)(NPR Music), despite being only an [EP](Extended play).

It was designed on the occasion of the [Campaign of 1813](German)(German Campaign of 1813), when [Wilhelm III of Prussia](Friedrich)(Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia) commissioned the Iron Cross as the first military decoration open to all ranks, including enlisted men. From this time, the Black Cross was featured on the [war flag](Prussian)(Flag of Prussia) alongside the Black Eagle. It was designed by neoclassical architect [Friedrich Schinkel](Karl)(Karl Friedrich Schinkel), based on Friedrich Wilhelm III. The design is ultimately derivative of the [cross](black)(Black Cross (Teutonic Order)) used by the [Order](Teutonic)(Teutonic Order). This heraldic cross took various forms throughout the order's history, including a [cross](Latin)(Latin cross), a [potent](cross)(cross potent), [fleury](cross)(cross fleury), and occasionally also a [patt\u00e9e](cross)(cross patt\u00e9e).\n\nWhen the [Quadriga](Quadriga) of the Goddess of Peace was retrieved from Paris at Napoleon's fall, it was re-established atop Berlin's [Gate](Brandenburg)(Brandenburg Gate). An Iron Cross was inserted into Peace's [laurel](bay laurel) [wreath](wreath), making her into a [of Victory](Goddess)(Victoria (mythology)). In 1821 Schinkel crowned the top of his design of the [Monument for the Liberation Wars](National)(Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars) with an Iron Cross, becoming name-giving as [Kreuzberg](Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)) (cross mountain) for the hill it stands on and, 100 years later, for the [quarter](homonymous)(Kreuzberg) adjacent to it.Klaus-Dieter Wille, *Spazierg\u00e4nge in Kreuzberg*, Berlin: Haude & Spener, 1986, (=Berliner Kaleidoskop: Schriften zur Berliner Kunst- und Kulturgeschichte; vol. 32), p.&nbsp;21. .\n\nThe Black Cross was used on the naval and combat flags of the [Empire](German)(German Empire). The Black Cross was used as the German Army symbol until 1915 when a simpler Balkenkreuz replaced it. The *[Reichswehr](Reichswehr)* of the [Republic](Weimar)(Weimar Republic) (1921\u201335), the *[Wehrmacht](Wehrmacht)* of [Germany](Nazi)(Nazi Germany) (1935\u201346), and the *[Bundeswehr](Bundeswehr)* (1 October 1956 to present) also inherited the use of the emblem in various forms.

Nichols spent most of his adult life in the [Lapeer](Lapeer County, Michigan) and [County](Sanilac)(Sanilac County, Michigan) areas of Michigan where mistrust and resentment of the federal government was common, especially after bank foreclosures of many farms during the 1980s.Stickney, p. 91. Neighbors said he attended meetings of anti-government groups, experimented with explosives and got more radical as time went on.\n\nNichols began to adhere to [citizen](sovereign)(Sovereign citizen movement) ideology. In February 1992, he attempted to [his US citizenship](renounce)(Renunciation of United States citizenship) by writing to the local county clerk in Michigan, stating that the political system was corrupt, and declaring himself a \"non resident alien\". Several months later, he appeared in court and tried to avoid responsibility for some of his credit card bills (he owed approximately $40,000 altogether), refusing to come before the bench, and shouting at the judge that the government had no [jurisdiction](jurisdiction) over him. On October 19, 1992, he signed another document renouncing his US citizenship. In May 1993, Nichols appeared before a county judge regarding an $8,421 unpaid credit card debt. He also renounced his [license](driver\u2019s)(driver\u2019s license).\n\nMcVeigh and Nichols grew closer after McVeigh's discharge from the Army. In December 1991, Nichols invited McVeigh to join him in Michigan and help him out selling military surplus at [show](gun)(gun show)s.Stickney, p. 129. For the next three years, McVeigh stayed with Nichols off and on.Stickney, p. 144. On April 19, 1993, Nichols was watching TV with McVeigh at the Nichols' farmhouse in Michigan during the [of the Branch Davidian compound](siege)(Waco siege) in [Texas](Waco,)(Waco, Texas). When the compound went up in flames, McVeigh and Nichols were enraged and began to plot revenge on the federal government. In the fall of 1993, Nichols and McVeigh, who were living at the farm, became business partners, selling weapons and military surplus at gun shows.

Belyayev](M.)(Mitrofan Belyayev), founder of the Russian Symphony Concerts]]\n\nRimsky-Korsakov wrote that he became acquainted with budding music patron [Belyayev](Mitrofan)(Mitrofan Belyayev) (M. P. Belaieff) in Moscow in 1882.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 261. Belyayev was one of a growing coterie of Russian nouveau-riche industrialists who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late-19th century Russia; their number included railway magnate [Mamontov](Savva)(Savva Mamontov) and textile manufacturer [Tretyakov](Pavel)(Pavel Tretyakov).Figes, pp. 195\u201397; Maes, 173\u201374, 196\u201397. Belyayev, Mamontov and Tretyakov \"wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life\".Taruskin, p. 49. They had worked their way into wealth, and being Slavophiles in their national outlook believed in the greater glory of Russia. Owing to this belief, they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent, and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones.Taruskin, *Stravinsky*, p. 42. This preference paralleled a general upsurge in nationalism and Russophilia that became prevalent in mainstream Russian art and society.Taruskin, *Stravinsky*, p. 44.\n\nBy 1883 Rimsky-Korsakov had become a regular visitor to the weekly \"quartet Fridays\" (\"Les Vendredis\") held at Belyayev's home in Saint Petersburg.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 269. Belyayev, who had already taken a keen interest in the musical future of the teenage [Glazunov](Alexander)(Alexander Glazunov), rented a hall and hired an orchestra in 1884 to play Glazunov's First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed. This concert and a rehearsal the previous year gave Rimsky-Korsakov the idea of offering concerts featuring Russian compositions, a prospect to which Belyayev was amenable. The [Symphony Concerts](Russian)(Russian Symphony Concerts) were inaugurated during the 1886\u201387 season, with Rimsky-Korsakov sharing conducting duties with Anatoly Lyadov.Abraham, *New Grove* (1980), 16:29\u201330; Zetlin, p. 313. He finished his revision of Mussorgsky's *[on Bald Mountain](Night)(Night on Bald Mountain)* and conducted it at the opening concert.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 281. The concerts also coaxed him out of his creative drought; he wrote *[Scheherazade](Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov))*, *[Espagnol](Capriccio)(Capriccio Espagnol)* and the *[Easter Overture](Russian)(Russian Easter Overture)* specifically for them. He noted that these three works \"show a considerable falling off in the use of contrapuntal devices&nbsp;... [replaced] by a strong and virtuoso development of every kind of figuration which sustains the technical interest of my compositions\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 296.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov was asked for advice and guidance not just on the Russian Symphony Concerts, but on other projects through which Belyayev aided Russian composers. \"By force of matters purely musical I turned out to be the head of the Belyayev circle\", he wrote. \"As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 288. In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual [prize](Glinka)(Glinka prize), and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, through which he published works by Borodin, Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov at his own expense. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.Maes, p. 173.\n\nThe group of composers who now congregated with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov became known as the [circle](Belyayev)(Belyayev circle), named after their financial benefactor. These composers were nationalistic in their musical outlook, as The Five before them had been. Like The Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike The Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition\u2014which Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in his years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.Maes, p. 192. Compared to the \"revolutionary\" composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be \"progressive&nbsp;... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but&nbsp;... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily&nbsp;...\"Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, pp. 286\u2013287.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The wealthy patron whose circle Rimsky-Korsakov led, promoting Russian nationalist composers and sponsoring the Russian Symphony Concerts, was **Mitrofan Belyayev** (also spelled M.

MacDonald was a major influence on both [R. R. Tolkien](J.)(J. R. R. Tolkien) and [S. Lewis](C.)(C. S. Lewis). The other major fantasy author of this era was [Morris](William)(William Morris), an English poet who wrote several novels in the latter part of the century, including ''[Well at the World's End](The)(The Well at the World's End)''.\n\nDespite MacDonald's future influence with *[the Back of the North Wind](At)(At the Back of the North Wind)* (1871), Morris's popularity with his contemporaries, and [G. Wells](H.)(H. G. Wells)'s *[Wonderful Visit](The)(The Wonderful Visit)* (1895), it was not until the 20th century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience. [Dunsany](Lord)(Lord Dunsany) established the genre's popularity in both the novel and the short story form. [Rider Haggard](H.)(H. Rider Haggard), [Kipling](Rudyard)(Rudyard Kipling), and [Rice Burroughs](Edgar)(Edgar Rice Burroughs) began to write fantasy at this time. These authors, along with [Merritt](Abraham)(Abraham Merritt), established what was known as the \"lost world\" subgenre, which was the most popular form of fantasy in the early decades of the 20th century, although several classic children's fantasies, such as *[Pan](Peter)(Peter Pan)* and *[Wonderful Wizard of Oz](The)(The Wonderful Wizard of Oz)*, were also published around this time.\n\n[fantasy](Juvenile)(Juvenile fantasy) was considered more acceptable than fantasy intended for adults, with the effect that writers who wished to write fantasy had to fit their work into forms aimed at children.[S. Lewis](C.)(C. S. Lewis), \"On Juvenile Tastes\", p 41, *Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories*,  [Hawthorne](Nathaniel)(Nathaniel Hawthorne) wrote fantasy in *[Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys](A)(A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys)*, intended for children,[Attebery](Brian)(Brian Attebery), The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature, p 62,  although works for adults only verged on fantasy. For many years, this and successes such as ''[Adventures in Wonderland](Alice's)(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)* (1865), created the circular effect that all fantasy works, even the later *[Lord of the Rings](The)(The Lord of the Rings)'', were therefore classified as children's literature.\n\nPolitical and social trends can affect a society's reception towards fantasy. In the early 20th century, the [Culture Movement](New)(New Culture Movement)'s enthusiasm for Westernization and science in China compelled them to condemn the fantastical [shenmo](shenmo) genre of traditional Chinese literature. The spells and magical creatures of these novels were viewed as superstitious and backward, products of a feudal society hindering the modernization of China. Stories of the supernatural continued to be denounced once the Communists rose to power, and mainland China experienced a revival in fantasy only after the [Revolution](Cultural)(Cultural Revolution) had ended.\n\nFantasy became a genre of [magazine](pulp)(pulp magazine)s published in the West. In 1923, the first all-fantasy fiction magazine, *[Tales](Weird)(Weird Tales)*, was published. Many other similar magazines eventually followed, including *[Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction](The)(The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction)*; when it was founded in 1949, the pulp magazine format was at the height of its popularity, and the magazine was instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the U.S. and Britain. Such magazines were also instrumental in the rise of science fiction, and it was at this time the two genres began to be associated with each other.\n\nBy 1950, \"[and sorcery](sword)(sword and sorcery)\" fiction had begun to find a wide audience, with the success of [E. Howard](Robert)(Robert E. Howard)'s [the Barbarian](Conan)(Conan the Barbarian) and [Leiber](Fritz)(Fritz Leiber)'s [and the Gray Mouser](Fafhrd)(Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser) stories.[Sprague de Camp](L.)(L.

R. R. Tolkien's *[Hobbit](The)(The Hobbit)* and *The Lord of the Rings*, which reached new heights of popularity in the late 1960s, that allowed fantasy to truly enter the mainstream.[Yolen](Jane)(Jane Yolen), \"Introduction\" p vii\u2013viii *After the King:  Stories in Honor of J.R.R.

He retained his position in active naval service, and taught his classes in uniform (military officers in Russia were required to wear their uniforms every day, as they were considered to be always on duty).Figes, p. 18.\n\n[[File:Saint Petersburg Conservatory.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A very large, three-story tall stone building in early 18th-century style, with many narrow windows|[Petersburg Conservatory](Saint)(Saint Petersburg Conservatory), where Rimsky-Korsakov taught from 1871 to 1906]]\n\nRimsky-Korsakov explained in his memoirs that [Azanchevsky](Mikha\u00edl)(Mikha\u00edl Azanchevsky) had taken over that year as director of the Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects,Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 116. had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services.Maes, p. 48. Biographer [Tsetlin](Mikhail)(Mikhail Tsetlin) (aka Mikhail Zetlin) suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style.Zetlin, pp. 194\u2013195. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor,Maes, p. 39. but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.Maes, pp. 169\u2013170.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov's reputation at this time was as a master of orchestration, based on *Sadko* and *Antar*.Zetlin, p. 195. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any [counterpoint](counterpoint), could not harmonize a simple [chorale](chorale), nor knew the names or [intervals](interval (music)) of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform.Zetlin, pp. 195\u2013196. Aware of his technical shortcomings,Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 117. Rimsky-Korsakov consulted [Ilyich Tchaikovsky](Pyotr)(Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky),Brown, *Crisis Years*, pp. 228\u2013229; Maes, p. 48. with whom he and the others in The Five had been in occasional contact.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 75. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory,Brown, *Early Years*, pp. 54\u201383. and was serving as Professor of [Theory](Music)(music theory) at the [Conservatory](Moscow)(Moscow Conservatory).Brown, *Early Years*, pp. 88\u201389. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.Brown, *Crisis Years*, pp. 228\u2013229.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov wrote that while teaching at the Conservatory he soon became \"possibly its very best *pupil* [emphasis](Rimsky-Korsakov's), judging by the quantity and value of the information it gave me!\"Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 119. To prepare himself, and to stay at least one step ahead of his students, he took a three-year sabbatical from composing original works, and assiduously studied at home while he lectured at the Conservatory. He taught himself from textbooks,Abraham, *New Grove (1980)*, 16:29. and followed a strict regimen of composing contrapuntal exercises, [fugue](fugue)s, chorales and *[cappella](a)(a cappella)* choruses.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov eventually became an excellent teacher and a fervent believer in academic training.Maes, p. 170. He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874, even acclaimed works such as *Sadko* and *Antar*, in a search for perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life. Assigned to rehearse the Orchestra Class, he mastered the art of conducting. Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor, and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class, led to an increased interest in the art of orchestration, an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands. The score of his Third Symphony, written just after he had completed his three-year program of self-improvement, reflects his hands-on experience with the orchestra.\n\n[[File:Nadezhda Purgold.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Side view of a young woman with dark hair braided up on her head|[Rimskaya-Korsakova](Nadezhda)(Nadezhda Rimskaya-Korsakova), n\u00e9e Purgold, wife of the composer]]Professorship brought Rimsky-Korsakov financial security,Abraham, *New Grove (1980)*, 16:28 which encouraged him to settle down and to start a family. In December 1871 he proposed to [Purgold](Nadezhda)(Nadezhda Rimskaya-Korsakova), with whom he had developed a close relationship over weekly gatherings of The Five at the Purgold household.Schonberg, p. 362; Zetlin, pp. 164\u2013166. They married in July 1872, with Mussorgsky serving as best man. The Rimsky-Korsakovs had seven children. Their first son, [Mikhail](Mikhail Rimsky-Korsakov), became an entomologist while another son, [Andrei](Andrey Rimsky-Korsakov), became a musicologist, married the composer Yuliya Veysberg and wrote a multi-volume study of his father's life and work.McAllister and Rayskin, *New Grove (2001)*, 21:423\u201324.\n\nNadezhda became a musical as well as domestic partner with her husband, much as [Schumann](Clara)(Clara Schumann) had been with her own husband Robert. She was beautiful, capable, strong-willed, and far better trained musically than her husband at the time they marriedAbraham, *New Grove (1980)*16:28\u201329.\u2014she had attended the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in the mid-1860s, studying piano with Anton Gerke (one of whose private students was Mussorgsky)Zetlin, p. 164. and music theory with [Zaremba](Nikolai)(Nikolai Zaremba), who also taught Tchaikovsky.Neff, *New Grove (2001)*, 21:423. Nadezhda proved a fine and most demanding critic of her husband's work; her influence over him in musical matters was strong enough for Balakirev and Stasov to wonder whether she was leading him astray from their musical preferences.Frolova-Walker, *New Grove (2001)*, 21:401. Musicologist Lyle Neff wrote that while Nadezhda gave up her own compositional career when she married Rimsky-Korsakov, she \"had a considerable influence on the creation of [Rimsky-Korsakov's] first three operas. She travelled with her husband, attended rehearsals and arranged compositions by him and others\" for piano four hands, which she played with her husband. \"Her last years were dedicated to issuing her husband's posthumous literary and musical legacy, maintaining standards for performance of his works&nbsp;... and preparing material for a museum in his name.\"\n\n[[File:Rimsky-Korsakov by Repin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A man with glasses and a long beard sitting on a sofa, smoking|Portrait of Rimsky-Korsakov by [Repin](Ilya)(Ilya Repin)]]\n\nIn early 1873, the navy created the civilian post of Inspector of Naval Bands, with a rank of Collegiate Assessor, and appointed Rimsky-Korsakov. This kept him on the navy payroll and listed on the roster of the Chancellery of the Navy Department but allowed him to resign his commission.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical life*, pp. 135\u2013136. The composer commented, \"I parted with delight with both my military status and my officer's uniform\", he later wrote. \"Henceforth I was a musician officially and incontestably.\" As Inspector, Rimsky-Korsakov applied himself with zeal to his duties. He visited naval bands throughout Russia, supervised the bandmasters and their appointments, reviewed the bands' repertoire, and inspected the quality of their instruments. He wrote a study program for a complement of music students who held navy fellowships at the Conservatory, and acted as an intermediary between the Conservatory and the navy. He also indulged in a long-standing desire to familiarize himself with the construction and playing technique of orchestral instruments.Leonard, p. 148. These studies prompted him to write a textbook on orchestration.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 136. He used the privileges of rank to exercise and expand upon his knowledge. He discussed arrangements of musical works for military band with bandmasters, encouraged and reviewed their efforts, held concerts at which he could hear these pieces, and orchestrated original works, and works by other composers, for military bands.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, pp. 141\u2013142.\n\nIn March 1884, an Imperial Order abolished the navy office of Inspector of Bands, and Rimsky-Korsakov was relieved of his duties. He worked under Balakirev in the [Chapel](Court)(Saint Petersburg Court Capella) as a deputy until 1894,Frolova-Walker, *New Grove (2001), 8:404; Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 335 which allowed him to study Russian Orthodox church music. He also taught classes at the chapel, and wrote his textbook on [harmony](harmony (music)) for use there and at the Conservatory.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov held the official naval position of **Inspector of Naval Bands** with the rank of **Collegiate Assessor** while combining his musical career with service in the Russian Navy.

It published [subLOGIC](subLOGIC)'s *[Flight Simulator](Microsoft)(Microsoft Flight Simulator)* and several [Entertainment Pack](Microsoft)(Microsoft Entertainment Pack) compilations of [minigame](minigame)s, but was best known for [MS-DOS](MS-DOS) and [Windows](Microsoft)(Microsoft Windows). In 1992, the company began increasing its focus on games. It announced *[Golf](Microsoft)(Microsoft Golf)* for Windows, based on [Software](Access)(Access Software)'s *[Links](Links (series))*, and expanded the games division from two to six people with the intention of commissioning more products from other developers.\n\nMicrosoft acquired [Interactive](FASA)(FASA Interactive) in 1999 for its *MechWarrior* game series, Access Software, and [Game Studio](Aces)(Aces Game Studio), which worked on *Flight Simulator*. The Games Group had also established long-term publishing deals with developers like [Studios](Ensemble)(Ensemble Studios) (*[of Empires](Age)(Age of Empires)*, *[of Mythology](Age)(Age of Mythology)*), and [Anvil](Digital)(Digital Anvil) (*Starlancer*). Under Microsoft, FASA Interactive was renamed FASA Studio, and Access Software became Salt Lake Games Studio.\n\nMicrosoft transitioned the Games Group into a wholly separate division named Microsoft Games around March 2000, along with other consolidation of games-related projects within Microsoft. This came alongside the public announcement of the first [console](Xbox)(Xbox (console)), with Microsoft Games to serve as a developer and publisher of titles for both Xbox and Windows. [Bach](Robbie)(Robbie Bach), who held executive positions in Microsoft's entertainment divisions, was named senior vice-president while [Fries](Ed)(Ed Fries), a member of the former Games Group and instrumental for some of its acquisitions, was named as vice-president of the new division. Shane Kim served as the division's general manager. In 2001, the division was renamed Microsoft Game Studios (MGS).\n\nFASA Studio and Salt Lake Games Studio remained with Microsoft Game Studios. Digital Anvil and Ensemble Studios were acquired by Microsoft in 2000 and 2001, respectively. One of the first major studio acquisitions following the division's formation was [Bungie](Bungie) in June 2000, in the midst of its development of *[Combat Evolved](Halo:)(Halo: Combat Evolved)*. With the acquisition, *Halo*, which had been planned for release on personal computers, became a Microsoft-published title as well as a launch title for the Xbox on its release in 2001. [10 Studios](Turn)(Turn 10 Studios) was established in 2001 for work on the *[Forza](Forza)* series of racing games. In September 2002, Microsoft Game Studios acquired [Rare](Rare (company)), who had previously extensively developed for [Nintendo](Nintendo) platforms. In 2003, Microsoft recognized that the [Sports](EA)(EA Sports) label was in a far stronger position to develop sports games for the Xbox console, and among realignment steps, laid off about 78 employees within Microsoft Game Studios that were developing sports games in-house, and sold Salt Lake Games Studio, now named Indie Games to [Interactive](Take-Two)(Take-Two Interactive) in 2004, where it became Indie Built.\n\n[Moore](Peter)(Peter Moore (businessman)) was named in 2003 as vice-president of Microsoft's Home and Entertainment Division, which included MGS, the Xbox division, and Microsoft's home hardware market, reporting to Bach. In addition to pulling big publishers like [Arts](Electronic)(Electronic Arts) to the Xbox platform, Moore tried to push the Xbox in Japan by courting Japanese developers with support from MGS publishing. Such games included *[Dust](Phantom)(Phantom Dust)* and *[The Time Sweeper](Blinx:)(Blinx: The Time Sweeper)*. Around 2004, MGS established [Games](Carbonated)(Carbonated Games) as an internal studio for the development of [game](casual)(casual game)s for Microsoft's web games portal [Games](MSN)(MSN Games), on the chat client [Messenger](MSN)(MSN Messenger), and on the [Live](Xbox)(Xbox Live) platform. Kim and Fries were instrumental for securing MGS' publishing deal with [Studios](Lionhead)(Lionhead Studios) for their 2004 game *[Fable](Fable (2004 video game))*, which would serve as the first major role-playing game on the Xbox platform. Subsequently, in 2006, MGS acquired Lionhead Studios along with the *Fable* properties, as it sought to secure a *Fable* sequel for the upcoming [360](Xbox)(Xbox 360). MGS folded the staff of Digital Anvil into the larger studio in 2005, following the release of 2003's *[Force](Brute)(Brute Force (video game))*, and closed down the studio entirely in 2006. FASA Studio was closed three-and-a-half months after the May 2007 release of their last game, *[Shadowrun](Shadowrun (2007 video game))*.\n\nIn 2007, MGS announced the opening of a European office in [Reading](Reading, Berkshire), England, headed by general manager [Spencer](Phil)(Phil Spencer (Microsoft)). Moore opted to leave Microsoft in July 2007, so to move back to the San Francisco Bay area with his family and to rejoin Electronic Arts. [Mattrick](Don)(Don Mattrick) was named as his replacement as the new vice-president of the Xbox and Games Business, which included MGS. Later in 2007, Bungie amicably split from MGS to become a privately held independent company, with MGS retaining the rights to the *Halo* property. Bungie continued to develop two additional *Halo* games for MGS, *[3: ODST](Halo)(Halo 3: ODST)* (2009) and *[Reach](Halo:)(Halo: Reach)* (2010). Simultaneously, MGS founded [Industries](343)(343 Industries) as an internal studio to develop future *Halo* games without Bungie.\n\nIn 2008, MGS disbanded Carbonated Games and announced the formation of internal studio [Live Productions](Xbox)(Xbox Live Productions) to develop \"high-quality digital content\" for [Live Arcade](Xbox)(Xbox Live Arcade). Microsoft as a whole announced layoffs of up to 5,000 jobs across all divisions in January 2009 due to slowing sales of personal computers as a result of the [financial crisis](late-2000s)(2007\u20132012 global financial crisis). Within MGS, the studio had already planned to disband Ensemble Studios after the completion of *[Wars](Halo)(Halo Wars)* in early 2009, while the new layoffs led MGS to also disband Aces Game Studio. Microsoft acquired Vancouver-based [BigPark](BigPark) in May 2009, using the studio to develop some of the first games for the upcoming [Kinect](Kinect) sensor for the Xbox 360. Later in 2009, Phil Spencer was promoted to corporate vice-president of MGS, in order to replace the retiring Shane Kim. In 2010, MGS formed a mobile gaming studio, [Mobile Gaming](MGS)(MGS Mobile Gaming), focused on developing gaming and entertainment multimedia for [Phone](Windows)(Windows Phone) devices. It also expanded Rare with a second studio in Digbeth, Birmingham.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Microsoft acquired **Bungie** in June 2000.

Another opinion, supported by Botticelli, was that the sculpture should be situated on or near the cathedral.\n\nIn June 1504, *David* was installed next to the entrance to the Palazzo Vecchio, replacing Donatello's [sculpture](bronze)(bronze sculpture) of [and Holofernes*](*Judith)(Judith and Holofernes (Donatello)), which embodied a comparable theme of heroic resistance.

During 25 April, Krukenberg was appointed as the commander of Defence Sector C, the sector under the most pressure from the Soviet assault on the city.\n\nOn 26 April, [Chuikov](Vasily Chuikov)'s [Guards Army](8th)(8th Guards Army) and the 1st Guards Tank Army fought their way through the southern suburbs and attacked Tempelhof Airport, just inside the S-Bahn defensive ring, where they met stiff resistance from the *M\u00fcncheberg* Division. But by 27 April, the two understrength divisions (*M\u00fcncheberg* and *Nordland*) that were defending the south-east, now facing five Soviet armies\u2014from east to west, the 5th Shock Army, the 8th Guards Army, the 1st Guards Tank Army and [Rybalko](Pavel Rybalko)'s 3rd Guards Tank Army (part of the 1st Ukrainian Front)\u2014were forced back towards the centre, taking up new defensive positions around Hermannplatz. Krukenberg informed General [Krebs](Hans)(Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)), [Chief](Chief of staff (military)) of the [Staff](General)(German General Staff) of [high command](Army)(Oberkommando des Heeres) that within 24 hours the *Nordland* would have to fall back to the centre sector Z (for *Zentrum*)., states the centre sector was known as Z for Zentrum; , and , quoting General Mohnke directly refers to the smaller centre government quarter\/district in this area and under his command as Z-Zitadelle. The Soviet advance to the city centre was along these main axes: from the south-east, along the Frankfurter Allee (ending and stopped at the [Alexanderplatz](Alexanderplatz)); from the south along [Sonnenallee](Sonnenallee (Berlin)) ending north of the [Belle-Alliance-Platz](Belle-Alliance-Platz), from the south ending near the [Platz](Potsdamer)(Potsdamer Platz#World War II) and from the north ending near the [Reichstag](Reichstag (building)). The Reichstag, the Moltke bridge, Alexanderplatz, and the Havel bridges at Spandau saw the heaviest fighting, with house-to-house and [combat](hand-to-hand)(hand-to-hand combat). The foreign contingents of the SS fought particularly hard, because they were ideologically motivated and they believed that they would not live if captured.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"On 23 April 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, Adolf Hitler appointed **Wilhelm Mohnke**, SS Brigadef\u00fchrer, as the Battle Commander for the central government district of Berlin, which included the Reich Chancellery and the F\u00fchrerbunker.

Operating on a tight budget of $400,000, Hess cast many of his friends from school, including Heder and [Ruell](Aaron)(Aaron Ruell), and he relied on the generosity of Preston locals, who provided housing and food to crew members. Among the established actors in the cast was comedy veteran [Bader](Diedrich)(Diedrich Bader), who filmed his scenes as virile martial art instructor Rex in one day. He recalled in 2011 that *Napoleon Dynamite* \"still to this day [is] one of the two top scripts I've ever read\", alongside *[Space](Office)(Office Space)* (1999), one of his most-recognized roles. \"It was very, very hot,\" Hess recalled in a *[Stone](Rolling)(Rolling Stone)* interview. \"But it was so much fun being in this rural farm town making a movie. We shot it in 23 days, so we were moving very, very fast; I just didn't have a lot of film to be able to do a lot of takes. It was a bunch of friends getting together to make a movie. It was like, 'Are people going to get this? Is it working?'\"\n\n[[File:Preston High School - Preston, Idaho.jpg|right|thumb|210px|[High School](Preston)(Preston High School (Idaho)) was one of the filming locations for the movie.]]\n\nHess describes the film as being \"so autobiographical\". \"I grew up in a family of six boys in Preston, Idaho, and the character of Napoleon was a hybrid of all the most nerdy and awkward parts of me and my brothers growing up. Jerusha really was like Deb growing up. Her mom made her a dress when she was going to a middle school dance and she said, 'I hadn't really developed yet, so my mom overcompensated and made some very large, fluffy shoulders.' Some guy dancing with her patted the sleeves and actually said, 'I like your sleeves ... they're real big,\"' Hess said in an interview with *[Stone](Rolling)(Rolling Stone)*.\n\nThe film is set during the 2004\u20132005 school year, as shown on Napoleon's student ID card in the title sequence. The film contains several culturally retroactive elements harkening back to the 1980s or 1990s. For example, Deb wears a side [ponytail](ponytail) and Napoleon wears [Boot](Moon)(Moon Boot)s, both popular fashion trends of the 1980s. One scene is set at a school dance that plays only 1980s music such as [Alphaville](Alphaville (band))'s \"[Young](Forever)(Forever Young (Alphaville song)),\" whereas an earlier scene features students performing a [language](sign)(American Sign Language) rendition of \"[Rose](The)(The Rose (song))\" (1980) sung by Bette Midler. Much of the technology in the film is also archaic; Napoleon uses a [VCR](VCR) and [Walkman](Walkman) [cassette](compact cassette) player, Kip connects to the Internet via a pay-per-minute [dial-up](Dial-up Internet access) connection and Uncle Rico drives a 1975 [Tradesman](Dodge)(Dodge Ram Van#Original B series).

Soriano first conceived of the ideal of a global football entity while at the Catalan club, beginning with the creation of Barca-branded overseas academies. Soriano contacted [League Soccer](Major)(Major League Soccer) Commissioner [Garber](Don)(Don Garber) about creating a Barcelona-branded MLS franchise and the pair progressed as far as looking into several locations to place the team, but ultimately these plans were curtailed when Soriano and seven other members of Barcelona's board chose to resign in protest of then-President [Laporta](Joan)(Joan Laporta)'s leadership.\n\nAfter a four-year break from football management, Soriano was hired in late 2012 to replace [Cook](Garry)(Garry Cook (administrator)) as CEO of Manchester City following the latter's resignation. Soriano revived his ambitions of creating a global football business entity, beginning by resuming dialogues with Garber. Their discussions resulted in the announcement of [York City FC](New)(New York City FC) as MLS' 20th expansion side less than one year later in May 2013. In the process of managing the creation of a second football team City Football Group was created, designed to be the holding company to which both Manchester City and NYCFC belonged. CFG expanded at the start of 2014 when it partnered with [league](Rugby)(Rugby league) side [Storm](Melbourne)(Melbourne Storm) to acquire a controlling stake in [A-League](A-League) franchise [Heart](Melbourne)(Melbourne Heart) for 12 million [dollars](Australian)(Australian dollars). The club would subsequently be rebranded to *Melbourne City FC* and their badge changed as part of CFG's early attempts to synergise their investments with Manchester City as a brand, and the club's colours would slowly be changed to sky blue with their red-and-white stripes retained as away colours.\n\nIn the weeks following their purchase of Melbourne City, CFG indicated their intentions of investing in women's football by rebranding Manchester City's female affiliate as ''Manchester City Women's Football Club'' and successfully lobbied for the team to be added to the top tier of the [Women's Super League](FA)(FA WSL), promising to invest in women's football on a scale never before seen in England. Later the following year CFG would grow again with the purchase of a 20% in Japanese side [F Marinos](Yokohama)(Yokohama F Marinos), the traditional company team of group sponsor [Nissan](Nissan Motor Company).\n\nIn April 2017, after a near three-year pause in its expansion, City Football Group announced the Uruguayan second-tier side [Atletico Torque](Club)(Club Atletico Torque), who would later be renamed Montevideo City Torque. Several months later Torque would be followed in by Spanish second division club [Girona](Girona FC), a club with ownership links to incumbent Manchester City manager [Guardiola](Pep)(Pep Guardiola).\n\n2019 saw the beginning of an increase in CFG's activity. The purchase of Chinese third division club [Jiuniu](Sichuan)(Sichuan Jiuniu F.C.) was followed towards the end of the year by a second venture in Asia, when the group bought a controlling stake in [Super League](Indian)(Indian Super League) franchise [City](Mumbai)(Mumbai City FC). 2020 similarly would see two club purchases in European football, first of [Lommel](Lommel S.K.) of Belgium and then of [Troyes](Troyes AC) of France, with both moves notably seeing the purchased clubs rescued from financial difficulties and linked to the economic damages wrought by the [pandemic](COVID-19)(COVID-19 pandemic). In the same year they would also expand their business interests by taking sole control of US-based [football](five-a-side)(five-a-side football) business Goals Soccer Centers, a business they had previously invested in, following the near-collapse of the company's owners due to an internal scandal.\n\nIn March 2022, Dutch second-tier side [Breda](NAC)(NAC Breda) announced that following an investigation into the best bidders to sell the club's shares, the shareholders of the club had agreed to a sale to CFG. In response, the club's fans held protests both in [Breda](Breda) and also [Manchester](Manchester) and [Lommel](Lommel). A month later, a group of shareholders with key voting rights announced that in light of the backlash they had elected instead to sell their shares to a local consortium.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"City Football Group was founded in 2013.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":9382.5571537018,"scoring_ms":494.4529533386,"total_ms":9877.2740364075,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"2013","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n**Sunday** is the *Challenge* night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick three dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n**Monday** episodes feature the *Pressure Test*. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n**Tuesday** episodes feature the *Immunity Challenge*, where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n**Wednesday** features a *Team Challenge*. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n**Thursday** is another *Elimination*. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head-to-head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head-to-head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. *MasterClass* airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The typical broadcast schedule for *MasterChef Australia* episodes is five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday, with each night featuring a different episode format:\n\n- **Sunday**: *Challenge* night.

The top three performers advance, while the bottom three are set to face elimination the next night.\n  \n- **Monday**: *Pressure Test*. The bottom three contestants from Sunday's challenge prepare a specific recipe under pressure. The judge evaluates their dishes, and the contestant with the weakest performance is eliminated.\n\n- **Tuesday**: *Immunity Challenge*.

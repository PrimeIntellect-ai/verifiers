Bethesda advertised that the edition would include a [canvas](canvas) [bag](duffel)(duffel bag), but a [nylon](nylon) one was included instead. Responding to customer complaints, Bethesda claimed that the bag had to be changed due to unavailability of materials, and initially stated the intention to take no action. The publisher received criticism for not making the change known beforehand, with *[Eurogamer](Eurogamer)* pointing out that the bag's description on Bethesda's website had only changed to read \"nylon\" after complaints had been submitted. Bethesda later offered affected customers free in-game currency of 500 atoms as compensation, equivalent to . Critics pointed out this amount of currency was not enough to purchase the in-game postman uniform (700 atoms), which includes a canvas bag. Additionally, it was discovered that Bethesda had produced a different *Fallout 76*\u2013themed canvas bag and given them for free to [influencers](online)(Internet celebrity), further adding to the fan outrage. Bethesda announced on December 3, 2018, that they would be producing canvas bags for all owners of the Power Armor special edition, which were ultimately said to be shipping \"in four to six months.\" In June 2019, the bags were delivered to customers.\n\nA [breach](data)(data breach) occurred on December 5, 2018, when a [glitch](glitch) in Bethesda's [system](support)(Issue tracking system) revealed personal information of approximately 65 *Fallout 76* customers who had submitted a support ticket to receive the canvas bag. Users were able to open and close tickets of other customers and view personal information, including names, addresses, emails and partial credit card information. In a statement given to *[Technica](Ars)(Ars Technica)*, Bethesda said that the breach occurred via \"an error with our customer support website\" and that they are \"investigating the incident and will provide additional updates as we learn more\". The publisher clarified that the only information leaked were details that the support site would have requested, rather than credit card numbers or passwords, and that they would notify all affected customers.\n\nIn 2018, Bethesda partnered with the Silver Screen Bottling Company to create \"Nuka Dark Rum\", an alcoholic beverage based on the in-game \"Nuka-Cola Dark\" introduced in the *[4: Nuka-World](Fallout)(Fallout 4: Nuka-World)* [add-on](Downloadable content). The rum was available to be pre-ordered in August 2018 for . While its release was expected to coincide with the launch of *Fallout 76*, the rum was delayed and was shipped instead in late December 2018. Upon receiving it, fans criticized the fact that the rum bottle advertised, previously expected to be a bottle in the missile-like shape of the in-game Nuka-Cola item, had turned out to be a standard glass bottle encased in a large plastic cover. The rum's asking price of $80 was subsequently condemned from expectations that the design would be of high quality, since none of the marketing had stated what the bottles would be made of.\n\nIn September 2019, collectible \"Nuka Cola\"\u2013themed *Fallout* helmets produced by Chronicle Collectibles, of which only 32 of the 20,000 manufactured were sold, were recalled by the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](U.S.)(U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission) due to containing high levels of mold and posing a health risk. No incidents or injuries were reported. [GameStop](GameStop), which sold the helmets, notified all customers who had purchased a helmet and offered them a full refund.\n\nIn June 2022, a *Kotaku* article published reports from ten anonymous former employees of Bethesda and its parent company [Media](ZeniMax)(ZeniMax Media) of severe mismanagement during *Fallout 76*s development. The reports claimed that [crunch](Crunch (video games)) had been enforced, leading to an \"exodus\" of senior developers from the company. The loss of staff led to Bethesda borrowing developers working on [Studios](Arkane)(Arkane Studios)' *[Redfall](Redfall)* and Bethesda's *[Starfield](Starfield (video game))* to assist with *Fallout 76*. Other alleged issues included technical problems with the game's design and engine, as well as these concerns being ignored by senior management. The sources expressed cynicism towards an improvement of working conditions at Bethesda (following their acquisition by Microsoft), saying \"It would be great if something like [ABetterABK](ABK Workers Alliance) existed for Bethesda [...] But everyone is terrified...because [Bethesda] HR is super cutthroat.\"\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The controversy involving the Fallout 76 Power Armor edition's physical item centered on the bag included in the edition.

Both Dacus and Bridgers had opened for Baker on separate tours in 2016, and they all ran in similar circles as young up-and-coming performers navigating the [indie](Independent music) scene.\n\nThe three became close and shared their frustrations of constantly being compared to each other as \"[in rock](women)(women in rock)\" despite their considerably different musical styles. Dacus has commented that the idea of women in music \"should not be remarkable whatsoever,\" with Bridgers adding, \"it's not a genre.\" Each has spoken on the tendency of the music industry to pit women against each other, and the group was formed in part to reject this idea. \"I hope people see the three of us and know there isn't competition,\" Dacus has said. \"You don't have to compete with your contemporaries. You can make something good with people you admire.\"\n\nBaker had joked to Dacus years before about a \"pipe dream\" that they could one day all form a band. The three decided to book a [tour](co-headlining)(Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers with Lucy Dacus Tour) in early 2018, and they originally planned to record a single or a [version](cover)(cover version) so that they could perform something together on stage. Upon meeting up that summer, however, they found themselves overwhelmed with ideas, and they ended up forming the band, writing, recording, and self-producing the *[Boygenius](Boygenius (EP))* [EP](Extended play) in four days, with the process involving almost exclusively women.\n\nEach brought one full song and one incomplete idea with them to the group. They sought to create an environment free of the competitiveness and \"bravado\" they had often encountered in previous experiences, and they have remarked that the absence of adult men in the process proved significant, allowing them to relate to each other openly without constantly having to explain themselves. The record was met with universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike; it was named the 12th best album of 2018 by [Music](NPR)(NPR Music), despite being only an [EP](Extended play).

It was also the fourth-best President's Day holiday weekend and Jim Carrey's second biggest opening weekend, behind *[Almighty](Bruce)(Bruce Almighty)* (2003). The success was attributed in part to the redesign of Sonic and the publicity it created, and the delayed release date, which meant it opened with less competition from other family films.

MLRS weapons system is collectively known as the M270 MLRS Self-Propelled Loader\/Launcher (SPLL). The SPLL is composed of three primary subsystems: the M269 Loader Launcher Module (LLM), which also houses the electronic Fire Control System, is mated to the M993 Carrier Vehicle.\n\n[[Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle ATTP.jpg|thumb|Task Force XXI Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle (ATTP)](File:Task)]\n\nThe M993 is the designation of the M987 carrier when it is used in the MLRS. The M987\/M993 is a lengthened derivative of the [Fighting Vehicle](Bradley)(Bradley Fighting Vehicle) chassis. The ground contact length is increased from  to . Originally called the Fighting Vehicle System, the M987 chassis was designed to serve as the basis for many other vehicles. These included the XM1070 Electronic Fighting Vehicle, the M4 Command and Control Vehicle, the Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle and the Forward Area Armored Logistics System (encompassing three vehicles including the XM1007 AFARV rearm vehicle.\n\nThe original GSRS plan called for 210&nbsp;mm diameter rockets. After European allies became involved with the project, these were replaced with 227&nbsp;mm rockets in order to accommodate the [mine](AT2)(AT2 mine).\n\n[War](Cold)(Cold War) doctrine for the M270 was for the vehicles to spread out individually and hide until needed, then move to a firing position and launch their rockets, immediately move away to a reloading point, then move to a completely new hiding position near a different firing point. These [shoot-and-scoot](shoot-and-scoot) tactics were planned to avoid susceptibility to Soviet [fire](counterbattery)(counterbattery fire). One M270 firing 12 [M26](M26 artillery rocket) rockets would drop 7,728 bomblets, and one MLRS battery of nine launchers firing 108 rockets had the equivalent firepower of 33 battalions of cannon artillery.\n\nThe system can fire rockets or [ATACMS](MGM-140)(MGM-140 ATACMS) missiles, which are contained in interchangeable pods. Each pod contains six standard rockets or one guided ATACMS missile; the two types cannot be mixed. The LLM can hold two pods at a time, which are hand-loaded using an integrated winch system. All twelve rockets or two ATACMS missiles can be fired in under a minute. One launcher firing twelve rockets can completely blanket one square [kilometer](kilometer) with [submunitions](cluster bomb). A typical MLRS cluster salvo consisted of three M270 vehicles each firing all 12 rockets. With each rocket containing 644 [grenades](M77)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition), the entire salvo would drop 23,184 grenades in the target area. However, with a two percent dud rate, that would leave approximately 400 undetonated bombs scattered over the area, which could endanger friendly troops and civilians.[After Cluster Bombs: Raining Nails](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2008\/05\/after-cluster-b\/) , *Wired*, 30 May 2008\n\nProduction of the M270 ended in 2003, when a last batch was delivered to the [Army](Egyptian)(Egyptian Army). In 2003, the U.S. Army began low-rate production of the [HIMARS](M142)(M142 HIMARS). The HIMARS fires all of the munitions of the MLRS, but is based on the chassis of the [of Medium Tactical Vehicles](Family)(Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles). As of 2012, BAE Systems still had the capability to restart production of the MLRS.\n\nIn 2006, MLRS was upgraded to fire guided rounds. Phase I testing of a guided unitary round (XM31) was completed on an accelerated schedule in March 2006. Due to an Urgent Need Statement, the guided unitary round was quickly fielded and used in action in [Iraq](Iraq War).[\"Guided MLRS Unitary Rocket Successfully Tested\"](http:\/\/www.mwjournal.com\/journal\/article.asp?HH_ID=AR_609) , *Microwave Journal*, Vol. 49, No. 3 (March 2006), p. 39. [Martin](Lockheed)(Lockheed Martin) also received a contract to convert existing M30 [Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM)](Dual-Purpose)(Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition) GMLRS rockets to the XM31 unitary variant.\n\nThe M31 GMLRS Unitary rocket transformed the M270 into a point target artillery system for the first time. Due to [Positioning System](Global)(Global Positioning System) (GPS) guidance and a single  high-explosive warhead, the M31 could hit targets accurately with less chance of collateral damage while needing fewer rockets to be fired, reducing logistical requirements. The unitary warhead also made the MLRS able to be used in urban environments. The M31 had a dual-mode fuse with point detonation and delay options to defeat soft targets and lightly fortified bunkers respectively, with the upgraded M31A1 equipped with a multi-mode fuse adding a [proximity](proximity fuze) [airburst](air burst) mode for use against personnel in the open; proximity mode can be set for  Height Of Burst (HOB). The GMLRS has a minimum engagement range of  and can hit a target out to , impacting at a speed of Mach 2.5.[M31 GMLRS Unitary](http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/systems\/munitions\/m31.htm) , Global security.[Precision Fires Rocket & Missile Systems](http:\/\/www.msl.army.mil\/Pages\/PFRMS\/pgmr.html) , MSL Army. In 2009 Lockheed Martin announced that a GMLRS had been successfully test fired out to .\n\nA German developmental artillery system, called the [Gun Module](Artillery)(Artillery Gun Module), has used the MLRS chassis on its developmental vehicles.\n\nIn 2012, a contract was issued to improve the armor of the M270s and improve the fire control to the standards of the M142 HIMARS. In June 2015, the M270A1 conducted tests of firing rockets after upgrades from the Improved Armored Cab project, which provides the vehicle with an enhanced armored cab and windows.[Improved Multiple Launch Rocket System tested at White Sands Missile Range](http:\/\/www.army.mil\/article\/153172\/Improved_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System_tested_at_White_Sands_Missile_Range\/) , Army, 31 July 2015\n\nIn early March 2021, Lockheed announced they had successfully fired an extended-range version of the GMLRS out to , part of an effort to increase the rocket's range to .

A supporting role opposite [Blanchett](Cate)(Cate Blanchett) and [Lee Jones](Tommy)(Tommy Lee Jones) in [Howard](Ron)(Ron Howard)'s *[Missing](The)(The Missing (2003 film))*, in which she played the kidnapped daughter Lilly Gilkeson, followed the same year, earning her a nomination for Best Leading Young Actress at the [Young Artist Awards](25th)(25th Young Artist Awards).\n\nIn 2005, Wood appeared opposite [Costner](Kevin)(Kevin Costner) and [Allen](Joan)(Joan Allen) in the [Binder](Mike)(Mike Binder)-directed *[Upside of Anger](The)(The Upside of Anger)*, a well-reviewed film in which Wood played Lavender \"Popeye\" Wolfmeyer, one of four sisters dealing with their father's absence. Her character also narrated the film. Wood's next two starring roles were in dark independent films. In the 2005 [Film Festival](Sundance)(Sundance Film Festival) Grand Jury Prize nominee *[Persuasion](Pretty)(Pretty Persuasion)*, a [comedy](black)(black comedy) focusing on the themes of [harassment in schools](sexual)(sexual harassment in education) and attitudes about women in media and society, Wood played Kimberly Joyce, a manipulative, sexually active high-schooler. One critic commented, \"Wood does flip cynicism with such precise, easy rhythms and with such obvious pleasure in naughtiness that she's impossible to hate.\" [Jacobson](David)(David Jacobson (director))'s [neo-western](neo-western) *[in the Valley](Down)(Down in the Valley (film))* premiered later that year, in which Wood's character, Tobe, falls in love with an older man, played by [Norton](Edward)(Edward Norton), a cowboy who is at odds with modern society. Of her performance, it was written that \"Wood conveys every bit of the adamant certainty and aching vulnerability inherent in late adolescence.\" Wood has commented on her sexually-themed roles, saying that she is not aiming for the \"shock factor\" in her film choices. Also in 2005, Wood starred in the music videos for [Eyes](Bright)(Bright Eyes (band))' \"At the Bottom of Everything\" and [Day](Green)(Green Day)'s \"[Me Up When September Ends](Wake)(Wake Me Up When September Ends)\".\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"In the 2001 film Little Secrets, Evan Rachel Wood's character, Emily Lindstrom, aspired to play the concert violin.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":3450.1941204071,"scoring_ms":590.3279781342,"total_ms":4041.4628982544,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Violin","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

It is organized in 114 [chapters](surah) (pl.:  , sing.:  ), which consist of [verses](\u0101yah) (pl.:  , sing.:  , [cons.](construct case): ). In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in [literature](Arabic)(Arabic literature), and has significantly influenced the [language](Arabic)(Arabic language).\n\nMuslims believe that the Quran was orally revealed by God to the [prophet](final)(Khatam an-Nabiyyin), [Muhammad](Muhammad in Islam), through the archangel [Gabriel](Gabriel) incrementally over a period of some 23 years, beginning on [Al Qadr](Laylat)(Night of Power),[Quran 97:1-5](https:\/\/quran.com\/97) when Muhammad was 40; and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad's most important [miracle](miracle), a proof of his [prophethood](prophethood); and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to [Adam](Adam in Islam), including the [Tawrat](Tawrat), the [Zabur](Zabur) ([Psalms](Psalms)) and the [Injil](Injil) (Gospel). The word *Quran* occurs some 70 times in the text itself, and other names and words are also said to refer to the Quran.\n\nThe Quran is believed by Muslims to be not simply divinely inspired, but the literal [of God](word)(Biblical inspiration). Muhammad did not write it as he did not know how to write. In Muslim theology, the Qur'an is considered to be either \"[created](Quranic createdness)\" or \"uncreated\".[*Ibn \u1e24anbal and the Mi\u1e25na*, 1897](Patton,)(#WMP1897): p.54 According to tradition, several of Muhammad's [companions](Companions of the Prophet) served as scribes, recording the revelations. Shortly after the prophet's death, the Quran was compiled by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it. Caliph [Uthman](Uthman) established a standard version, now known as the [codex](Uthmanic)(Uthmanic codex), which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, [readings](variant)(Qira\u02bcat), with mostly minor differences in meaning.\n\nThe Quran assumes [with major narratives](familiarity)(Biblical and Quranic narratives) recounted in the [Biblical](Books of the Bible) and [scriptures](apocryphal)(Apocrypha). It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for humankind ( ). It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence. Supplementing the Quran with explanations for some cryptic Quranic narratives, and rulings that also provide the basis for Islamic law in most denominations of Islam, are *[hadith](hadith)s*\u2014oral and written traditions believed to describe words and actions of Muhammad.  During prayers, the Quran is recited only in [Arabic](Arabic).\n\nSomeone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a *[hafiz](Hafiz (Quran))*. Ideally, verses are recited with a special kind of [prosody](Prosody (linguistics)) reserved for this purpose, called *[tajwid](tajwid)*. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during *[tarawih](tarawih)* prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, Muslims rely on [exegesis](exegesis), or commentary rather than a direct translation of the text.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_tJ6eQ3bL6SLIKRUA7CKiTcmE\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Peace to you!

During the show's run, two of Galecki's former *Roseanne* co-stars appeared on the show: [Gilbert](Sara)(Sara Gilbert) (as [Winkle](Leslie)(Leslie Winkle), Leonard's colleague) and [Metcalf](Laurie)(Laurie Metcalf) (as Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mother). Galecki is a [cellist](cello), a talent that was used on the show. Until 2013, Galecki and his *Big Bang* co-stars [Cuoco](Kaley)(Kaley Cuoco) and Jim Parsons each earned US$325,000 per episode.Battaglio, Stephen; Schneider, Michael (August 26, 2013). \"What They Earn\". *[Guide](TV)(TV Guide)*. pp. 16 \u2013 20. By 2014, the three were earning US$1 million per episode.\n\nGalecki appeared briefly in the 2008 superhero comedy *[Hancock](Hancock (film))*, alongside [Smith](Will)(Will Smith) and [Bateman](Jason)(Jason Bateman). In July 2011, he played a parody version of himself in three episodes of *[Entourage](Entourage (U.S. TV series))*. He also appeared in the film *[Time](In)(In Time)* (2011) with [Timberlake](Justin)(Justin Timberlake) and [Seyfried](Amanda)(Amanda Seyfried).\n\nGalecki appeared in one episode of the [revival of *Roseanne*](2018)(Roseanne (season 10)) on ABC. The show, despite its high ratings, was cancelled after [Barr](Roseanne)(Roseanne Barr) posted a racist and controversial tweet about [Jarrett](Valerie)(Valerie Jarrett). *Roseanne* was replaced by a new program, *[Conners](The)(The Conners)*, which premiered in October 2018 and featured the same cast without Barr.

The design is ultimately derivative of the [cross](black)(Black Cross (Teutonic Order)) used by the [Order](Teutonic)(Teutonic Order). This heraldic cross took various forms throughout the order's history, including a [cross](Latin)(Latin cross), a [potent](cross)(cross potent), [fleury](cross)(cross fleury), and occasionally also a [patt\u00e9e](cross)(cross patt\u00e9e).\n\nWhen the [Quadriga](Quadriga) of the Goddess of Peace was retrieved from Paris at Napoleon's fall, it was re-established atop Berlin's [Gate](Brandenburg)(Brandenburg Gate). An Iron Cross was inserted into Peace's [laurel](bay laurel) [wreath](wreath), making her into a [of Victory](Goddess)(Victoria (mythology)). In 1821 Schinkel crowned the top of his design of the [Monument for the Liberation Wars](National)(Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars) with an Iron Cross, becoming name-giving as [Kreuzberg](Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)) (cross mountain) for the hill it stands on and, 100 years later, for the [quarter](homonymous)(Kreuzberg) adjacent to it.Klaus-Dieter Wille, *Spazierg\u00e4nge in Kreuzberg*, Berlin: Haude & Spener, 1986, (=Berliner Kaleidoskop: Schriften zur Berliner Kunst- und Kulturgeschichte; vol. 32), p.&nbsp;21. .\n\nThe Black Cross was used on the naval and combat flags of the [Empire](German)(German Empire). The Black Cross was used as the German Army symbol until 1915 when a simpler Balkenkreuz replaced it. The *[Reichswehr](Reichswehr)* of the [Republic](Weimar)(Weimar Republic) (1921\u201335), the *[Wehrmacht](Wehrmacht)* of [Germany](Nazi)(Nazi Germany) (1935\u201346), and the *[Bundeswehr](Bundeswehr)* (1 October 1956 to present) also inherited the use of the emblem in various forms. The traditional design in black is used on armored vehicles and aircraft, while after [reunification](German)(German reunification), a new creation in blue and silver was introduced for use in other contexts.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The Black Cross emblem used by the Prussian and German armies was designed by the neoclassical architect Friedrich Schinkel.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"generation_ms":3795.8831787109,"scoring_ms":587.3620510101,"total_ms":4385.7684135437,"info":{"oai_tools":[{"function":{"description":"Search for top 10 relevant articles using title embedding similarity.","name":"search_pages","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":{"description":"The query to search for.","title":"Query","type":"string"},"section_id":null},"required":["query"],"title":"search_pages_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"View the sections of a page.","name":"view_sections","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":{"description":"The ID of the page to view.","title":"Page Id","type":"string"},"query":null,"section_id":null},"required":["page_id"],"title":"view_sections_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"},{"function":{"description":"Read a section of a page.","name":"read_section","parameters":{"additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"page_id":null,"query":null,"section_id":{"description":"The ID of the section to read.","title":"Section Id","type":"string"}},"required":["section_id"],"title":"read_section_args","type":"object"}},"type":"function"}]},"answer":"Karl Friedrich Schinkel","total_tool_calls":3.0,"search_pages_calls":1.0,"view_sections_calls":1.0,"read_section_calls":1.0,"judge_reward_func":1.0}

Burj Khalifa uses the bundled [tube](tube (structure)) design of the [Tower](Willis)(Willis Tower), invented by [Rahman Khan](Fazlur)(Fazlur Rahman Khan). Due to its tubular system, proportionally only half the amount of steel was used in the construction, compared to the [State Building](Empire)(Empire State Building). Khan's contributions to the design of tall buildings have had a profound impact on architecture and engineering. It would be difficult to find any worldwide practices in the design of tall buildings that have not been directly or indirectly influenced by his work. The design is reminiscent of [Lloyd Wright](Frank)(Frank Lloyd Wright)'s vision for [Illinois](The)(The Illinois), a mile-high skyscraper designed for Chicago, as well as Chicago's [Point Tower](Lake)(Lake Point Tower). When [Smith](Adrian)(Adrian Smith (architect)) was conceiving the project at SOM, he looked out his office window toward Lake Point Tower's curved three-wing layout and thought, \"There's the prototype\". According to Strabala, Burj Khalifa was designed based on the 73 floor [Palace Three](Tower)(Tower Palace Three Tower), an all-residential building in [Seoul](Seoul). In its early planning, Burj Khalifa was intended to be entirely residential.\n\nAfter the original design by Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, Emaar Properties chose Hyder Consulting to be the supervising engineer and NORR Group Consultants International Ltd to supervise the architecture of the project. Hyder was selected for their expertise in structural and [MEP](Architectural engineering#Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP)) (mechanical, electrical and plumbing) engineering. Hyder Consulting's role was to supervise construction, certify the architect's design, and be the engineer and architect of record to the UAE authorities. NORR's role was the supervision of all architectural components including on-site supervision during the construction and design of a 6-story addition to the office annex building for architectural documentation. NORR was also responsible for the architectural integration drawings for the Armani Hotel included in the Tower. Emaar Properties also engaged [GHD](GHD Group), an international multidisciplinary consulting firm, to act as an independent verification and testing authority for concrete and steelwork.\n\nThe design is derived from Islamic architecture. As the tower rises from the flat desert base, there are 27 [setbacks](setback (architecture)) in a spiral pattern, decreasing the cross-section of the tower as it rises and creating convenient outdoor terraces. These setbacks are arranged and aligned in a way that minimizes vibration wind loading from eddy currents and vortices. At the top, the central core emerges and is sculpted to form a finishing spire. At its tallest point, the tower sways a total of .\n\n[[File:Samara spiralovity minaret rijen1973.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The spiral minaret at the [Mosque of Samarra](Great)(Great Mosque of Samarra)]]\n\nThe spire of Burj Khalifa is composed of more than  of structural steel. The central pinnacle pipe weighs  and has a height of . The spire also houses communications equipment. This  spire is widely considered [height](vanity)(vanity height), since very little of its space is usable. Without the spire, Burj Khalifa would be  tall. This was reported in a [on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat](Council)(Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat) study, which notes that the empty spire \"could be a skyscraper on its own\". Such a skyscraper, if located in Europe, would be the 11th tallest building on that continent.\n\nIn 2009 architects announced that more than 1,000 pieces of art would adorn the interiors of Burj Khalifa, while the residential lobby of Burj Khalifa would display the work of [Plensa](Jaume)(Jaume Plensa).\n\nThe cladding system consists of  of more than 26,000 reflective glass panels and aluminium and textured [steel](stainless)(stainless steel) [spandrel](spandrel) panels with vertical tubular fins. The [glass](architectural)(architectural glass) provides solar and thermal performance as well as an anti-glare shield for the intense desert sun, extreme desert temperatures and strong winds. The glass covers more than  in area. The Burj's typical curtain wall panels measure  wide by  high and weigh about  each, with wider panels near the building's edges and taller ones near the top.\n\nThe exterior temperature at the top of the building is thought to be 6&nbsp;\u00b0C (11&nbsp;\u00b0F) cooler than at its base.\n\nA 304-room Armani Hotel, the first of four by [Armani](Armani), occupies 15 of the lower 39 floors. The hotel was supposed to open on 18 March 2010, but after several delays, it finally opened to the public on 27 April 2010. The corporate suites and offices were also supposed to open from March onwards, yet the hotel and observation deck remained the only parts of the building which were open in April 2010.\n\nThe [lobbies](sky)(sky lobby) on the 43rd and 76th floors house swimming pools. Floors 20 through 108 have 900 private residential [apartment](apartment)s (which, according to the developer, sold out within eight hours of being on the market). An outdoor [swimming pool](zero-entry)(Swimming pool#Zero-entry swimming pools) is located on the 76th floor of the tower. Corporate offices and suites fill most of the remaining floors, except for the 122nd, 123rd, and 124th, where the *At.mosphere* restaurant, sky lobby, and an indoor and outdoor observation deck are located respectively. In January 2010, it was planned that Burj Khalifa would receive its first residents in February 2010.\n\nThe building has 57 elevators and 8 escalators. The elevators have a capacity of 12 to 14 people per cabin, and include the world's fastest [elevator](double-deck)(double-deck elevator)s, rising and descending at up to . Engineers initially considered installing the world's first triple-deck elevators. The double-deckers are equipped with LCD displays to amuse visitors during their travel to the observation deck.

Warner Bros. had the distribution rights but it wasn't one of their own, so I think it might have been [marketed] harder if it was.\"\n\nHugh Grant stated in an October 2014 interview, \"I thought [Atlas*](*Cloud) was amazing.

And, sadly, *Cloud Atlas* never really found the audience it deserved.\" He later stated in 2016 \"the whole thing was fascinating.

P. Belaieff) in Moscow in 1882.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 261. Belyayev was one of a growing coterie of Russian nouveau-riche industrialists who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late-19th century Russia; their number included railway magnate [Mamontov](Savva)(Savva Mamontov) and textile manufacturer [Tretyakov](Pavel)(Pavel Tretyakov).Figes, pp. 195\u201397; Maes, 173\u201374, 196\u201397. Belyayev, Mamontov and Tretyakov \"wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life\".Taruskin, p. 49. They had worked their way into wealth, and being Slavophiles in their national outlook believed in the greater glory of Russia. Owing to this belief, they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent, and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones.Taruskin, *Stravinsky*, p. 42. This preference paralleled a general upsurge in nationalism and Russophilia that became prevalent in mainstream Russian art and society.Taruskin, *Stravinsky*, p. 44.\n\nBy 1883 Rimsky-Korsakov had become a regular visitor to the weekly \"quartet Fridays\" (\"Les Vendredis\") held at Belyayev's home in Saint Petersburg.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 269. Belyayev, who had already taken a keen interest in the musical future of the teenage [Glazunov](Alexander)(Alexander Glazunov), rented a hall and hired an orchestra in 1884 to play Glazunov's First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed. This concert and a rehearsal the previous year gave Rimsky-Korsakov the idea of offering concerts featuring Russian compositions, a prospect to which Belyayev was amenable. The [Symphony Concerts](Russian)(Russian Symphony Concerts) were inaugurated during the 1886\u201387 season, with Rimsky-Korsakov sharing conducting duties with Anatoly Lyadov.Abraham, *New Grove* (1980), 16:29\u201330; Zetlin, p. 313. He finished his revision of Mussorgsky's *[on Bald Mountain](Night)(Night on Bald Mountain)* and conducted it at the opening concert.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 281. The concerts also coaxed him out of his creative drought; he wrote *[Scheherazade](Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov))*, *[Espagnol](Capriccio)(Capriccio Espagnol)* and the *[Easter Overture](Russian)(Russian Easter Overture)* specifically for them. He noted that these three works \"show a considerable falling off in the use of contrapuntal devices&nbsp;... [replaced] by a strong and virtuoso development of every kind of figuration which sustains the technical interest of my compositions\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 296.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov was asked for advice and guidance not just on the Russian Symphony Concerts, but on other projects through which Belyayev aided Russian composers. \"By force of matters purely musical I turned out to be the head of the Belyayev circle\", he wrote. \"As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 288. In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual [prize](Glinka)(Glinka prize), and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, through which he published works by Borodin, Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov at his own expense. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.Maes, p. 173.\n\nThe group of composers who now congregated with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov became known as the [circle](Belyayev)(Belyayev circle), named after their financial benefactor. These composers were nationalistic in their musical outlook, as The Five before them had been. Like The Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike The Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition\u2014which Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in his years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.Maes, p. 192. Compared to the \"revolutionary\" composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be \"progressive&nbsp;... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but&nbsp;... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily&nbsp;...\"Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, pp. 286\u2013287.\n","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"The wealthy patron whose circle Rimsky-Korsakov led, promoting Russian nationalist composers and sponsoring the Russian Symphony Concerts, was Mitrofan Belyayev.

MacDonald was a major influence on both [R. R. Tolkien](J.)(J. R. R. Tolkien) and [S. Lewis](C.)(C. S. Lewis). The other major fantasy author of this era was [Morris](William)(William Morris), an English poet who wrote several novels in the latter part of the century, including ''[Well at the World's End](The)(The Well at the World's End)''.\n\nDespite MacDonald's future influence with *[the Back of the North Wind](At)(At the Back of the North Wind)* (1871), Morris's popularity with his contemporaries, and [G. Wells](H.)(H. G. Wells)'s *[Wonderful Visit](The)(The Wonderful Visit)* (1895), it was not until the 20th century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience. [Dunsany](Lord)(Lord Dunsany) established the genre's popularity in both the novel and the short story form. [Rider Haggard](H.)(H. Rider Haggard), [Kipling](Rudyard)(Rudyard Kipling), and [Rice Burroughs](Edgar)(Edgar Rice Burroughs) began to write fantasy at this time. These authors, along with [Merritt](Abraham)(Abraham Merritt), established what was known as the \"lost world\" subgenre, which was the most popular form of fantasy in the early decades of the 20th century, although several classic children's fantasies, such as *[Pan](Peter)(Peter Pan)* and *[Wonderful Wizard of Oz](The)(The Wonderful Wizard of Oz)*, were also published around this time.\n\n[fantasy](Juvenile)(Juvenile fantasy) was considered more acceptable than fantasy intended for adults, with the effect that writers who wished to write fantasy had to fit their work into forms aimed at children.[S. Lewis](C.)(C. S. Lewis), \"On Juvenile Tastes\", p 41, *Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories*,  [Hawthorne](Nathaniel)(Nathaniel Hawthorne) wrote fantasy in *[Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys](A)(A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys)*, intended for children,[Attebery](Brian)(Brian Attebery), The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature, p 62,  although works for adults only verged on fantasy. For many years, this and successes such as ''[Adventures in Wonderland](Alice's)(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)* (1865), created the circular effect that all fantasy works, even the later *[Lord of the Rings](The)(The Lord of the Rings)'', were therefore classified as children's literature.\n\nPolitical and social trends can affect a society's reception towards fantasy. In the early 20th century, the [Culture Movement](New)(New Culture Movement)'s enthusiasm for Westernization and science in China compelled them to condemn the fantastical [shenmo](shenmo) genre of traditional Chinese literature. The spells and magical creatures of these novels were viewed as superstitious and backward, products of a feudal society hindering the modernization of China. Stories of the supernatural continued to be denounced once the Communists rose to power, and mainland China experienced a revival in fantasy only after the [Revolution](Cultural)(Cultural Revolution) had ended.\n\nFantasy became a genre of [magazine](pulp)(pulp magazine)s published in the West. In 1923, the first all-fantasy fiction magazine, *[Tales](Weird)(Weird Tales)*, was published. Many other similar magazines eventually followed, including *[Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction](The)(The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction)*; when it was founded in 1949, the pulp magazine format was at the height of its popularity, and the magazine was instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the U.S. and Britain. Such magazines were also instrumental in the rise of science fiction, and it was at this time the two genres began to be associated with each other.\n\nBy 1950, \"[and sorcery](sword)(sword and sorcery)\" fiction had begun to find a wide audience, with the success of [E. Howard](Robert)(Robert E. Howard)'s [the Barbarian](Conan)(Conan the Barbarian) and [Leiber](Fritz)(Fritz Leiber)'s [and the Gray Mouser](Fafhrd)(Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser) stories.[Sprague de Camp](L.)(L. Sprague de Camp), *[Swordsmen and Sorcerers](Literary)(Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers): The Makers of Heroic Fantasy*, p 135  However, it was the advent of [fantasy](high)(high fantasy), and most of all J. R. R. Tolkien's *[Hobbit](The)(The Hobbit)* and *The Lord of the Rings*, which reached new heights of popularity in the late 1960s, that allowed fantasy to truly enter the mainstream.[Yolen](Jane)(Jane Yolen), \"Introduction\" p vii\u2013viii *After the King:  Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien*, ed, Martin H. Greenberg,  Several other series, such as C. S. Lewis's *[of Narnia](Chronicles)(Chronicles of Narnia)* and [K. Le Guin](Ursula)(Ursula K. Le Guin)'s [Earthsea](Earthsea) books, helped cement the genre's popularity.\n\nThe popularity of the fantasy genre has continued to increase in the 21st century, as evidenced by the best-selling status of [K. Rowling](J.)(J. K. Rowling)'s [Potter](Harry)(Harry Potter) series, [Jordan](Robert)(Robert Jordan)'s *[Wheel of Time](The)(The Wheel of Time)* series, [R. R. Martin](George)(George R. R.

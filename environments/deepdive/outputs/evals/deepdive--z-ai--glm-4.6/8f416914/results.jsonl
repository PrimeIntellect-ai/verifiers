This operation represented one of the first large-scale uses of motorized military forces in colonial warfare, though the term \"mechanized\" is somewhat misleading by modern standards.\\n\\n**Key Details of the Operation:**\\n\\n**Forces and Equipment:**\\n- Approximately 12,500 Italian troops\\n- 1,785 motor vehicles of various types (Fiats, Lancias, Alfa-Romeos, Fords, Chevrolets, Bedfords, and Studebakers)\\n- A squadron of L3 light tankettes (CV-33\/35 models)\\n- Eleven batteries of artillery\\n- 193 horses transported for ceremonial purposes\\n- Air reconnaissance support from the Regia Aeronautica\\n\\n**Strategic Context:**\\nThe advance began after Badoglio\\'s decisive victory at the Battle of Maychew on March 31, 1936, which effectively destroyed the last organized Ethiopian army. Emperor Haile Selassie fled the capital on May 2, 1936, as Italian forces approached. The mechanized column covered approximately 200 miles (320 km) from Dessie to Addis Ababa in just ten days, demonstrating the potential for rapid military movement in difficult terrain.\\n\\n**Operational Challenges:**\\n- Poor road conditions (described by Badoglio as \"a bad cart track\")\\n- Rain and mud causing delays\\n- Limited resistance from Ethiopian forces\\n- One significant ambush at Chacha near Debre Berhan by Ethiopian forces under Haile Mariam Mammo, resulting in approximately 170 Italian colonial troop casualties\\n\\n**Historical Significance:**\\nWhile primarily a propaganda victory for Mussolini\\'s fascist regime, the operation demonstrated the military potential of motorized forces in colonial campaigns. However, military historians note that it was more of a logistics exercise than a true mechanized military operation by later standards. The Italian forces faced minimal opposition, and the \"mechanized\" column was essentially motorized infantry using commercial vehicles rather than purpose-built military equipment.\\n\\nThe capture of Addis Ababa on May 5, 1936, led to Italy\\'s official annexation of Ethiopia on May 7, and the establishment of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana) on June 1, 1936, uniting Ethiopia with Eritrea and Italian Somaliland.\\n']\n[Execution time: 46.53s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_de58144fcdca44fc892935b3\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"result3 = llm_batch([\\\\\\\"Research Italian journalists and political figures who administered Rome and later became the first leader of Addis Ababa after its capture, focusing on their role in cultural preservation legislation.\\\\\\\"])\\\\nprint(\\\\\\\"Result 3:\\\\\\\", result3)\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 1 call(s) in 53.15s\n  [0]: 31843 tokens, 5 tool calls, 53.15s \u26a0 max turns\nResult 3: ['\\\\text{There is no historical figure who matches all the described criteria.

This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city.

This investigation visualized the research domain focused on specific, low-concentration elements within a primary fossil fuel and its residual ash, analyzing trends and collaborations over a period concluding in 2017, starting from the early 1970s. The methodology involved mapping knowledge structures using analytical software. A researcher involved in this mapping effort has also contributed to studies on building WebGIS database systems specifically for trace elements in Chinese coal, and separately, on modeling water resource challenges in China's capital using specific planning tools. The study involved contributions from a key mining technology university located in Beijing and researchers affiliated with a national standardization body.

Look for:\n   - Consistent facts across sources (high confidence)\n   - Contradictions that need resolution\n   - Gaps that require follow-up research\n\n4. **Iterate if needed**: If the initial research reveals new questions or missing information, dispatch another batch of targeted sub-tasks. Repeat until you have sufficient evidence.\n\n5. **Finalize**: Write your synthesized answer to `answer[\"content\"]`, verify it addresses the original question, then set `answer[\"ready\"] = True`.\n\nKey insight: Sub-LLMs handle the verbose web content, returning concise summaries. This keeps your context clean while leveraging deep research.\n<\/env_tips>","role":"user","tool_calls":null},{"content":"I need to break down this complex multi-step research question.

entrepreneur and philanthropist, recognized for substantial contributions to a movement advocating for specific group equality. His work involves examining the standing of such groups, for instance, in a South Asian country where legal codes concerning them stem from a colonial past. That jurisdiction's primary legal framework for offenses, a legacy of its former administrators, was later amended. This amendment was part of a governmental era dedicated to integrating religious tenets into the state's laws. Such integration reportedly heightened friction between two major denominations of a global faith within that territory. The broader animosity between these denominations has seen one extremist organization direct violence against one denomination specifically. This organization's acts included an assault on a significant religious shrine, the resting place of a venerated figure's descendant.

This study captures the understanding of a particular senior practitioner. A key contributor to this 2014 paper, published in a journal focused on traditional Chinese medical arts, has previously explored combined Eastern\/Western therapies for secondary growths in neck lymph nodes (mid-1990s), the use of traditional pills to alleviate chemotherapy's effects on digestive vitality (early 2010s), and the protective effects of certain plant-derived injections against nerve damage caused by chemotherapy agents (around 2010). This contributor often works between an institution symbolizing Sino-Japanese cooperation and a prominent capital university specializing in traditional medicine, though for this specific lung-focused paper published mid-decade, the collaborators hailed exclusively from the latter institution."},"answer":"Professor ZHANG Daizhao's Knowledge of the Pathogenesis of Lung Cancer Based on Data Mining Technology","judge_reward_func":0.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":50.0,"prompt_tokens":305085.0,"completion_tokens":9639.0,"total_tool_calls":50.0}
{"example_id":7,"prompt":[{"content":"Consider a song by an Asian rock band, known in two language versions and produced by a prominent musician from a contemporary group, whose peninsular iteration was released by an entertainment firm. This firm obtained listing on a domestic automated quotation system, which was itself benchmarked against a major North American stock market. A key index featuring large non-financial companies from this North American market later included a multinational semiconductor enterprise, specializing in data conversion, during a significant annual component review.

This work ventured beyond one dimension, analyzing how quantum probability distributions spread across a plane.\n\nThe study focused on the 'feasible region' and its limiting shape, surprisingly linking it to algebraic geometry. The methods employed relied heavily on analyzing generating functions, echoing approaches refined by a well-regarded probability expert at an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, known for his work in combinatorics and recognized by multiple fellowships (including one bearing the name of a notable mathematician and hedge fund founder).\n\nOne key author on this paper, then affiliated with a major industrial research laboratory in New Jersey famed for its foundational contributions to communications technology, had previously published on diverse topics: applying topological invariants like the Euler characteristic to sensor network problems, comparing congestion patterns in hyperbolic versus Euclidean network models, and exploring geometric relationships involving simplices and Gaussian samples during his earlier research period in Germany.

type known for its unrestricted forwarding, a characteristic that became problematic. This issue spurred the development of new remote access protocols. One such intermediate protocol, which verified a user's ability to receive mail before allowing them to send, was itself superseded. This successor protocol, standardizing sender login, is fundamental to the operation of a type of software agent that processes outgoing mail from the user's application, often using a distinct, designated communication channel.

2020 publication featured in an IET journal focused on power generation and distribution. This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies. This particular power systems investigation involved synergistic efforts between academics from a prominent engineering institution in Nanjing and experts from electric power research entities in Zhejiang."},"answer":"Distribution Network Operational Risk Assessment and Early Warning Considering Multi\u2010risk Factors","judge_reward_func":0.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":50.0,"prompt_tokens":254175.0,"completion_tokens":7500.0,"total_tool_calls":50.0}

prominent international heritage journal around 2012, this Norwegian study examines the gap between official criteria and community-driven motivations for preserving cultural sites, particularly those not deemed nationally significant, including structures once central to rural education. It originated from research at an Oslo-based institute dedicated to cultural heritage research, involving a scholar who had recently published a comparative analysis of certain humble educational buildings found in Norway and the American Midwest. This work explores why local volunteers invest in their shared past, suggesting social cohesion often outweighs formal value assessment, challenging the resonance of centrally defined professionalism in these settings.

{"example_id":27,"prompt":[{"content":"Consider a specific composer's early 1960s arrangement of a country's traditional song, an arrangement written for a specific cultural event and later played at the opening of important performance spaces. One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

Xi'an, known for research spanning intelligent electrical apparatus, power device reliability (including IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs), and UHF sensor applications for diagnostics, emerges a solution published in late 2021 in an IEEE journal dedicated to sensors. This work, involving researchers including one often associated with high-voltage studies and apparatus diagnostics, addresses a critical challenge in power system monitoring: how to precisely measure waveform components beyond the fundamental, especially when the system's core frequency fluctuates significantly, staying within bounds acknowledged by recent standards. The method employs a refined, adaptive technique leveraging principles related to Fourier analysis for evolving signals.

Each sub-LLM has access to web search tools (search, open) and can:\n   - Search for relevant information\n   - Open promising results to read full content\n   - Extract and summarize key facts\n\n3. **Synthesize findings**: After collecting sub-LLM responses, combine and cross-reference their findings. Look for:\n   - Consistent facts across sources (high confidence)\n   - Contradictions that need resolution\n   - Gaps that require follow-up research\n\n4. **Iterate if needed**: If the initial research reveals new questions or missing information, dispatch another batch of targeted sub-tasks. Repeat until you have sufficient evidence.\n\n5. **Finalize**: Write your synthesized answer to `answer[\"content\"]`, verify it addresses the original question, then set `answer[\"ready\"] = True`.\n\nKey insight: Sub-LLMs handle the verbose web content, returning concise summaries.

Each sub-LLM has access to web search tools (search, open) and can:\n   - Search for relevant information\n   - Open promising results to read full content\n   - Extract and summarize key facts\n\n3. **Synthesize findings**: After collecting sub-LLM responses, combine and cross-reference their findings. Look for:\n   - Consistent facts across sources (high confidence)\n   - Contradictions that need resolution\n   - Gaps that require follow-up research\n\n4. **Iterate if needed**: If the initial research reveals new questions or missing information, dispatch another batch of targeted sub-tasks. Repeat until you have sufficient evidence.\n\n5. **Finalize**: Write your synthesized answer to `answer[\"content\"]`, verify it addresses the original question, then set `answer[\"ready\"] = True`.\n\nKey insight: Sub-LLMs handle the verbose web content, returning concise summaries.

recent physiological study (circa 2022) focused on brain plasticity following ischemic events. Using resting-state EEG, it delves into the *directed* functional connections within the motor network of patients in the subacute stage, post-rehabilitation. The investigation highlights changes in information flow by employing and comparing two frequency-domain measures designed to assess causal influence, differentiating direct pathways from mediated ones, particularly within alpha and beta rhythms. The research team brought together expertise from Italy's national research council, university departments spanning the mainland to Sicily, and a dedicated rehabilitation facility. Among the authors is a female figure prominent in Italian biomedical research, whose background includes foundational work on autonomic nervous system signals derived from ECG, as well as contributions to sophisticated neuroimaging analyses involving diffusion techniques and magnetization transfer, sometimes collaborating with London-based institutions.

Each sub-LLM has access to web search tools (search, open) and can:\n   - Search for relevant information\n   - Open promising results to read full content\n   - Extract and summarize key facts\n\n3. **Synthesize findings**: After collecting sub-LLM responses, combine and cross-reference their findings. Look for:\n   - Consistent facts across sources (high confidence)\n   - Contradictions that need resolution\n   - Gaps that require follow-up research\n\n4. **Iterate if needed**: If the initial research reveals new questions or missing information, dispatch another batch of targeted sub-tasks. Repeat until you have sufficient evidence.\n\n5. **Finalize**: Write your synthesized answer to `answer[\"content\"]`, verify it addresses the original question, then set `answer[\"ready\"] = True`.\n\nKey insight: Sub-LLMs handle the verbose web content, returning concise summaries. This keeps your context clean while leveraging deep research.\n<\/env_tips>","role":"user","tool_calls":null},{"content":"I'll break down this complex chain of references into parallel research tasks to unravel each connection systematically.\n","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_7e812e37bf0949129c5e2aba\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"prompts\\\":\\\"[\\\\\\\"Research musical albums with themes around 'dark traveling spectacle' that incorporated elements from musical styles known for societal critique.

work delved into physician attitudes towards AI within German university hospital settings and contributed to protocols for improving critical care, like ARDS surveillance, across multiple centers. This individual also examined ways to enhance infectious disease management, including bacteremia, in regional German clinics. In 2023, collaborating with colleagues based in Leipzig specializing in medical informatics and statistics, this researcher tackled a challenge central to the German Medical Informatics Initiative: How to make data structured according to a specific 'Fast' standard, optimized for health data exchange, usable for common statistical analysis which predominantly requires tabular structures? Their contribution, detailed in a publication within *Applied Clinical Informatics*, offers an open-source solution integrated into a widely-used statistical programming language, specifically designed to 'crack' open and flatten these complex resources for researchers.

What is the precise title of this comparative surgical study?\n\n<env_tips>\nStrategy for deep research tasks:\n\n1. **Decompose the question**: Break the main question into multiple smaller, focused research sub-tasks that can be investigated independently.\n\n2. **Parallel sub-LLM research**: Use `llm_batch()` to dispatch these sub-tasks in parallel. Each sub-LLM has access to web search tools (search, open) and can:\n   - Search for relevant information\n   - Open promising results to read full content\n   - Extract and summarize key facts\n\n3. **Synthesize findings**: After collecting sub-LLM responses, combine and cross-reference their findings. Look for:\n   - Consistent facts across sources (high confidence)\n   - Contradictions that need resolution\n   - Gaps that require follow-up research\n\n4. **Iterate if needed**: If the initial research reveals new questions or missing information, dispatch another batch of targeted sub-tasks. Repeat until you have sufficient evidence.\n\n5. **Finalize**: Write your synthesized answer to `answer[\"content\"]`, verify it addresses the original question, then set `answer[\"ready\"] = True`.\n\nKey insight: Sub-LLMs handle the verbose web content, returning concise summaries.

Each sub-LLM has access to web search tools (search, open) and can:\n   - Search for relevant information\n   - Open promising results to read full content\n   - Extract and summarize key facts\n\n3. **Synthesize findings**: After collecting sub-LLM responses, combine and cross-reference their findings. Look for:\n   - Consistent facts across sources (high confidence)\n   - Contradictions that need resolution\n   - Gaps that require follow-up research\n\n4. **Iterate if needed**: If the initial research reveals new questions or missing information, dispatch another batch of targeted sub-tasks. Repeat until you have sufficient evidence.\n\n5. **Finalize**: Write your synthesized answer to `answer[\"content\"]`, verify it addresses the original question, then set `answer[\"ready\"] = True`.\n\nKey insight: Sub-LLMs handle the verbose web content, returning concise summaries. This keeps your context clean while leveraging deep research.\n<\/env_tips>","role":"user","tool_calls":null},{"content":"I'll help you find the precise title of this comparative surgical study.

{"example_id":47,"prompt":[{"content":"A mid-19th-century naval vessel, later bearing a name of Teutonic origin associated with a mythological fire deity, was key in the first combat use of a specific type of aerial weapon carrier. This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's. Within this nation's air arm, a specific numerically designated squadron, which had earlier flown other aircraft types against targets such as projectile launch sites, was eventually equipped with this effective fighter. In which country was this squadron finally stood down after the conclusion of continental hostilities?\n\n<env_tips>\nStrategy for deep research tasks:\n\n1. **Decompose the question**: Break the main question into multiple smaller, focused research sub-tasks that can be investigated independently.\n\n2. **Parallel sub-LLM research**: Use `llm_batch()` to dispatch these sub-tasks in parallel.

This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's. Within this nation's air arm, a specific numerically designated squadron, which had earlier flown other aircraft types against targets such as projectile launch sites, was eventually equipped with this effective fighter. In which country was this squadron finally stood down after the conclusion of continental hostilities?\n\n<env_tips>\nStrategy for deep research tasks:\n\n1. **Decompose the question**: Break the main question into multiple smaller, focused research sub-tasks that can be investigated independently.\n\n2. **Parallel sub-LLM research**: Use `llm_batch()` to dispatch these sub-tasks in parallel.

later bearing a name of Teutonic origin associated with a mythological fire deity, was key in the first combat use of a specific type of aerial weapon carrier. This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's. Within this nation's air arm, a specific numerically designated squadron, which had earlier flown other aircraft types against targets such as projectile launch sites, was eventually equipped with this effective fighter.

This entity established a subsidiary specializing in solar electricity, a field rapidly advancing in a major South Asian nation which notably utilizes building summits for energy capture. These summit-based energy installations are photovoltaic systems that often channel surplus electricity into the broader power grid. A critical electronic device in these grid-integrated setups is responsible for converting the panel's direct current output into alternating current. On a much larger scale, similar current conversion technology is employed in systems designed for bulk power transmission over extensive distances using direct current at very high potentials. Such long-distance systems, which operate with this non-alternating current to reduce energy loss, may, in certain configurations (especially those with a single main conductor), use a specific type of conductor to link to an earth grounding point.

This amendment was part of a governmental era dedicated to integrating religious tenets into the state's laws. Such integration reportedly heightened friction between two major denominations of a global faith within that territory.

A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy\\'s first class in 1854, he served with notable distinction and was often associated with advanced naval technology and command.\\n\\n**Military Career Highlights:**\\n*   **Civil War Service:** Selfridge had an active and often perilous Civil War career. He helped save the USS *Cumberland* during the destruction of the Norfolk Navy Yard and was on board when she was sunk by the CSS *Virginia*. He briefly commanded the revolutionary turret ship USS *Monitor*. He later commanded the USS *Cairo* and USS *Conestoga* on the Mississippi River, both of which were sunk in action, earning him a reputation for being \"sinkable.\" He finished the war commanding the USS *Huron* during the assaults on Fort Fisher.\\n*   **Post-War Service:** After the war, Selfridge commanded several vessels, including the USS *Nipsic*, USS *Enterprise*, and USS *Omaha* on the Asiatic Station. He led three expeditions to Panama (1870, 1870, 1873) to survey potential canal routes. He rose to the rank of Captain (1881), Commodore (1894), and finally Rear Admiral (1896), becoming part of the first father-son pair of admirals in U.S. Navy history. He retired in 1898 as Commander in Chief of the European Squadron.\\n\\n**Rotating Turret and Harbor Defense Proposal:**\\nThe query connects Selfridge to a \"rotating turret\" proposal for \"California harbor defense.\" While he is well-documented for briefly commanding the USS *Monitor*\u2014the Navy\\'s first turret ship\u2014specific information about a personal proposal he authored for a land-based rotating turret in California is not readily available in standard historical sources.\\n\\nHowever, his expertise was highly valued in naval policy. In 1881, he was appointed president of a **Naval Advisory Board** tasked with assessing the future of the U.S. Navy. This board, sometimes referred to as the \"Selfridge Board,\" was critical in shaping the modernization of the fleet. Its report advocated for a new generation of steel warships, including armored cruisers and battleships, all centered on the concept of the rotating gun turret as the primary offensive weapon.

To solve this problem, a DN operational risk assessment and early warning method based on conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is proposed in this study. Firstly, the multi-risk factors of DN are identified, and the probability models of load fluctuation, wind power, photovoltaic output, and equipment failure are established. Secondly, on the basis of the above models, the probabilistic power flow is calculated by the Monte Carlo method, and the severity functions of voltage violation, line overload, and power loss are constructed to quantify the consequences of faults. Thirdly, the CVaR theory is introduced to assess the operational risk of DN, and a comprehensive risk index is established. Finally, an early warning mechanism based on the risk index is proposed to realize the risk warning of DN. The proposed method is applied to the improved IEEE 33-bus system, and the results show that the proposed method can effectively assess the operational risk of DN and provide a reliable basis for risk warning.\\n\\n**Collaboration between Nanjing and Zhejiang Institutions:**\\nYes, there is clear collaboration between institutions in Nanjing and Zhejiang.

It coincides with the Somali New Year in late July or early August, marking the beginning of the main harvest season. The festival's history traces back to the medieval Ajuran Sultanate and was later centralized under the Geledi Sultanate in the 19th century. Originally, participants fought with real weapons like swords and spears, but for safety, these were replaced with sticks. The festival is deeply rooted in local tradition, with the belief that performing the ritual appeases spirits, ensuring a bountiful harvest and warding off misfortune, famine, and drought. The central event involves a mock stick fight between two teams representing the different sides of the town, divided by the Shebelle River. The festivities also include extensive singing (shirib), dancing, and a communal feast.\n\n\\vspace{0.5em}\n\\textbf{Geodetic Coordinate System for Afgooye}\\\\\n\\vspace{0.2em}\nThe town of Afgooye uses a local geodetic datum named \\textbf{A\n\n==================================================\n\nSearch 3:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{**Historical Control:**} \\\\\n&\\text{\u2022 Kilwa Sultanate directly controlled Mombasa (14th-16th c.).} \\\\\n&\\text{\u2022 Afgooye was politically separate, controlled by local Somali dynasties (Silcis, Ajuran, Geledi).} \\\\\n\\\\\n&\\text{**Trade Networks:**} \\\\\n&\\text{\u2022 All three were part of the Indian Ocean trade network.} \\\\\n&\\text{\u2022 Kilwa and Mombasa were major coastal maritime city-states.} \\\\\n&\\text{\u2022 Afgooye was a vital inland hub that supplied the coastal trade with goods from the Somali interior,}\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\n==================================================\n[Execution time: 161.68s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_0fafb6bdedb94105ba3db64f\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Let me search for the specific geodetic system used in Afgooye, Somalia\\\\nprompts = [\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for the complete name of the geodetic datum used in Afgooye, Somalia - it starts with 'A' and is used for Somali mapping\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for what ellipsoid is used by the Somali geodetic system starting with 'A'\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for the mathematical representation of Earth used in Somalia's geodetic coordinate system\\\\\\\"\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\nresults = llm_batch(prompts)\\\\nfor i, result in enumerate(results):\\\\n    print(f\\\\\\\"Search {i+1}:\\\\\\\")\\\\n    print(result[:800])\\\\n    print(\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\" + \\\\\\\"=\\\\\\\"*50 + \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\")\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 3 call(s) in 36.24s\n  [0]: 2093 tokens, 1 tool calls, 5.15s \u2713\n  [1]: 28253 tokens, 5 tool calls, 36.22s \u26a0 max turns\n  [2]: 16025 tokens, 5 tool calls, 27.16s \u26a0 max turns\nSearch 1:\n\n\n==================================================\n\nSearch 2:\nKrasovsky 1940\n\n==================================================\n\nSearch 3:\n\\text{Somalia's geodetic system (Afgooye datum) uses the Krassowsky 1940 ellipsoid, defined by a semi-major axis of 6,378,245 m and an inverse flattening of 298.3.}\n\n==================================================\n[Execution time: 91.09s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_aabfd4d357444912a8e2678b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Now I have all the pieces.

Dr. Tsukamoto is currently a Professor of Pathology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.\\n\\n**Author\\'s Research Background (Iron Regulation and HFE Gene)**\\n\\nDr. Hidekazu Tsukamoto is a prominent researcher whose work has significantly advanced the understanding of liver injury, fibrosis, and the role of iron metabolism in these processes. His research background is deeply rooted in investigating the mechanisms of alcoholic liver disease (ALD).\\n\\n*   **Iron Regulation in Liver Disease:**\\n    *   Dr. Tsukamoto\\'s lab was among the first to demonstrate the synergistic role of iron and alcohol in accelerating experimental liver cirrhosis. His 1995 paper in the *Journal of Clinical Investigation*, \"Experimental liver cirrhosis induced by alcohol and iron,\" was a landmark study showing that dietary iron dramatically worsens alcohol-induced liver fibrosis.\\n    *   He identified a key mechanism where iron accumulates specifically in hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells) during alcoholic liver injury. This iron overload is not passive; it acts as a critical \"priming\" signal.\\n    *   His research revealed that this excess intracellular iron in Kupffer cells amplifies the inflammatory response to gut-derived endotoxin (a common feature in ALD), leading to heightened activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and increased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, thereby exacerbating liver damage.\\n\\n*   **HFE Gene and Molecular Iron Homeostasis:**\\n    *   Extending his work on iron\\'s role, Dr. Tsukamoto investigated the molecular genetics of iron regulation, particularly the function of the **HFE gene**. Mutations in HFE are the cause of most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis.\\n    *   His research group elucidated the protein-protein interactions of the HFE protein. Specifically, they demonstrated that the interaction between the HFE protein and transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) is essential for the proper regulation of hepcidin, the liver-produced hormone that controls the body\\'s systemic iron balance.\\n    *   By connecting the function of the HFE gene to hepcidin expression, his work provided a crucial mechanistic link between a genetic defect and the systemic iron overload that damages the liver.\\n\\nIn summary, while the 1999 paper focuses on cytokine signaling, Dr. Tsukamoto\\'s broader research career has been instrumental in defining how dysregulated iron metabolism and genetic factors like the HFE gene contribute to the pathogenesis of liver inflammation and fibrosis.\\n']\n[Execution time: 173.93s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_d2c6939583c346528fc791a4\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Let me search for hepatic stellate cell signal transduction papers from around 1999 in relevant journals\\\\nprompts = [\\\\\\\"Search for review papers published in 1998-2000 with titles containing 'signal transduction' and 'hepatic stellate cells' or 'Ito cells' in journals like Hepatology, Journal of Hepatology, Gastroenterology, or Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

During this time, the Serbian Orthodox Church, particularly the Patriarchate of Pe\u0107, played a vital role in preserving the identity of Serbs living in both the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Military Frontier. Liturgical books, hagiographies, and chronicles from this era were often printed or copied for these communities and their introductions or dedications frequently addressed the hardships and faith of the \"Serbs of the border\" or \"pre\u010dani\" (those from \"across the river\" - the Sava and Danube).\\n\\nIn summary, while the specific term \"Military Frontier\" is anachronistic for the medieval period, later religious texts, written in a tradition that looked back to the medieval golden age, are filled with references to the spiritual life of Serbs in these exact border regions.\\n']\n[Execution time: 94.27s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_9f632cd691bc4337afdee55f\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Based on my extensive research, I can now piece together the answer.

Its operational history can be divided into four main phases:\\n\\n**1. Western Desert Campaign (1940-1942)**\\n*   **Aircraft:** Initially equipped with Gloster Gladiators and Hawker Hurricane Mk Is, it quickly became the first squadron in the Western Desert to be fully equipped with Hurricanes.\\n*   **Missions:** The squadron became operational in September 1940, flying convoy patrols, bomber escorts, and ground-attack missions against Italian forces. It claimed its first victories, two SM.79 bombers, on 10 September 1940. It played a crucial role in the defense of Tobruk in 1941 and provided air cover during the battles in the Cyrenaica region.\\n\\n**2. Fighter-Bomber and Coastal Defence (1942-1944)**\\n*   **Aircraft:** In May 1942, the squadron re-equipped with the Hurricane Mk IIC, known as the \"Hurri-bomber,\" for fighter-bomber operations.\\n*   **Missions:** The squadron was heavily involved in the Battle of El Alamein, conducting intensive ground-attack sorties against Axis armor and transport. Following the Axis defeat in North Africa, the squadron was assigned to coastal defence duties for the remainder of 1942 and most of 1943. In January 1944, it moved to Italy to fly offensive sweeps against enemy communications.\\n\\n**3. Return to the UK and Anti-V-1 Operations (1944)**\\n*   **Aircraft:** In April 1944, the squadron returned to the UK and re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire Mk IX.\\n*   **Missions:** Based at RAF Detling, the squadron initially conducted fighter sweeps over Normandy in support of the D-Day landings. It was soon reassigned to intercept German V-1 \"flying bombs,\" becoming part of \"Anti-Diver\" patrols.\\n\\n**4. Tempests in North-West Europe (1944-1945)**\\n*   **Aircraft:** In August 1944, the squadron converted to the Hawker Tempest Mk V.\\n*   **Missions:** Moving to Belgium in September, the squadron joined the Second Tactical Air Force for the final push into Germany. Its primary missions were low-level armed reconnaissance, interdiction attacks on enemy airfields and transport, and intercepting the new German jet aircraft, the Messerschmitt Me 262. It flew its final wartime mission on 4 May 1945.\\n\\n**Disbandment:**\\nFollowing the end of the war in Europe, No. 274 Squadron moved into the Occupied Zone of Germany. It was officially disbanded on 7 September 1945 by being re-numbered to No. 174 Squadron.\\n', 'Yes.

This entity established a subsidiary specializing in solar electricity, a field rapidly advancing in a major South Asian nation which notably utilizes building summits for energy capture. These summit-based energy installations are photovoltaic systems that often channel surplus electricity into the broader power grid. A critical electronic device in these grid-integrated setups is responsible for converting the panel's direct current output into alternating current. On a much larger scale, similar current conversion technology is employed in systems designed for bulk power transmission over extensive distances using direct current at very high potentials. Such long-distance systems, which operate with this non-alternating current to reduce energy loss, may, in certain configurations (especially those with a single main conductor), use a specific type of conductor to link to an earth grounding point.

adapted from literature and set in a warm, humid climate zone, which included a particular actor in its cast. This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city. This political figure initially entered the national legislative body following a nationwide electoral contest, which distinctively integrated, for the first time, elected officials from several newly acquired territories. Among these territories was a particular island that gained representation in that election.

need arose to address wildfire risk and promote renewable energy using materials from federal forests. A study, published in a prominent forestry journal, delved into the common narratives\u2014the accepted 'truths'\u2014often cited as roadblocks. It synthesized perspectives gathered through in-depth interviews with diverse local stakeholders (industry, agency, community, tribal) across ten representative US sites. One contributor to this work, holding advanced degrees from both the UK and a major Midwestern land-grant university system, had also previously explored the synthesis of environmental guidelines for biomass harvesting and assessed the lifecycle impacts of roundwood logistics in the Great Lakes region. This contributor collaborated with specialists in fire social science based at Forest Service research stations, and academics focused on resource policy and workforce issues affiliated with universities spanning from the Upper Midwest to the Pacific Coast.

entrepreneur and philanthropist, recognized for substantial contributions to a movement advocating for specific group equality. His work involves examining the standing of such groups, for instance, in a South Asian country where legal codes concerning them stem from a colonial past. That jurisdiction's primary legal framework for offenses, a legacy of its former administrators, was later amended. This amendment was part of a governmental era dedicated to integrating religious tenets into the state's laws. Such integration reportedly heightened friction between two major denominations of a global faith within that territory. The broader animosity between these denominations has seen one extremist organization direct violence against one denomination specifically. This organization's acts included an assault on a significant religious shrine, the resting place of a venerated figure's descendant. During this assault, what full name belongs to the local resident lauded for a courageous act of intervention against an assailant, thereby reducing harm within the sanctuary?"},"answer":"Najih Shaker Al-Baldawi","judge_reward_func":0.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"main_rlm_turns":50.0,"main_rlm_prompt_tokens":259966.0,"main_rlm_completion_tokens":6781.0}

foundational paper, the first installment of a two-part series, published before the 1990s in a journal dedicated to applied polymer science. Originating from a prominent Midwestern university known for engineering, it investigates the flow of a specific fluoropolymer melt through an extensional geometry used in film production, focusing on the stress history analysis via computation and optical methods. This work aimed to link processing conditions to final material structure, a theme explored further in its companion paper.\n\nA key contributor to this study later became a distinguished professor and department head at a university in the Southeastern US, known for his extensive work on complex fluid dynamics. His research portfolio includes detailed simulations leveraging various bead-spring and bead-rod models, deciphering polymer effects in turbulent flows, understanding fluid permeation through fibrous materials relevant to composite manufacturing (collaborating with experts in that field), and examining instabilities at the interface of flowing polymer layers.\n\nIdentify the precise title of this initial paper analyzing the melt's journey through the specific flow setup."},"answer":"Processing\u2013property Interactions in Poly(vinylidene Fluoride).

prominent TMS journal (JOM) outlining a vision for accelerating materials design. It championed the use of statistical learning and informatics to bridge the often non-linear gap between material structure and properties across vastly different dimensions. This approach integrated computational thermodynamics and kinetic simulations into a powerful infrastructure. One of the authors, who held faculty positions involving interdisciplinary engineering chairs after moving from the East Coast (following earlier stints at MIT, Cambridge, and in Canada) to the Midwest around this time, brought expertise in applying informatics to diverse problems \u2013 from atom-by-atom analysis of irradiated alloys and metallic glass formation to high-throughput screening and designing biomaterials. This author collaborated on this specific paper with two colleagues renowned for their work in computational thermodynamics and phase-field modeling, both associated with a major materials science department in Pennsylvania.

specific 2011 paper published in a statistical physics journal. This work ventured beyond one dimension, analyzing how quantum probability distributions spread across a plane.\n\nThe study focused on the 'feasible region' and its limiting shape, surprisingly linking it to algebraic geometry. The methods employed relied heavily on analyzing generating functions, echoing approaches refined by a well-regarded probability expert at an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, known for his work in combinatorics and recognized by multiple fellowships (including one bearing the name of a notable mathematician and hedge fund founder).\n\nOne key author on this paper, then affiliated with a major industrial research laboratory in New Jersey famed for its foundational contributions to communications technology, had previously published on diverse topics: applying topological invariants like the Euler characteristic to sensor network problems, comparing congestion patterns in hyperbolic versus Euclidean network models, and exploring geometric relationships involving simplices and Gaussian samples during his earlier research period in Germany.

This issue spurred the development of new remote access protocols. One such intermediate protocol, which verified a user's ability to receive mail before allowing them to send, was itself superseded. This successor protocol, standardizing sender login, is fundamental to the operation of a type of software agent that processes outgoing mail from the user's application, often using a distinct, designated communication channel. This agent, in turn, cooperates with a different agent for the actual routing of messages between various computer systems. While this routing agent functions in the background, the end-user interacts directly with software acting on their behalf. If such user-facing software, exemplified by a web navigation application on a specific model of tablet computer from the early 2010s, transmits an identification string, what particular sequence of characters and numbers, denoting the core rendering engine technology it is built upon, would appear after the details specifying the device and its operating system, but before any mention of compatibility with other rendering engines?"},"answer":"AppleWebKit\/531.21.10","judge_reward_func":1.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"main_rlm_turns":50.0,"main_rlm_prompt_tokens":194937.0,"main_rlm_completion_tokens":4426.0}

These junctions, distinct from at-grade crossings, can support special lanes, including for high-occupancy vehicles as mentioned in their general description. Such lanes, if tolled for some users, first appeared in a western state in the 1990s. The company initially managing these pioneering tolled lanes (via a state franchise agreement) is now part of a global group. Its state partner agency, which evolved from a 19th-century bureau, oversees that state's official highway network. This network includes a specific route, with documented legislative origin, that passes a mountain summit often closed in winter and is near a locale known for an amphibian contest. An early military leader from this same state, who proposed a novel harbor defense plan involving rotating turrets, later died in what specific eastern metropolitan district?\n\n<env_tips>\nStrategy for deep research tasks:\n\n1. **Decompose the question**: Break the main question into multiple smaller, focused research sub-tasks that can be investigated independently.\n\n2. **Parallel sub-LLM research**: Use `llm_batch()` to dispatch these sub-tasks in parallel. Each sub-LLM has access to web search tools (search, open) and can:\n   - Search for relevant information\n   - Open promising results to read full content\n   - Extract and summarize key facts\n\n3. **Synthesize findings**: After collecting sub-LLM responses, combine and cross-reference their findings. Look for:\n   - Consistent facts across sources (high confidence)\n   - Contradictions that need resolution\n   - Gaps that require follow-up research\n\n4. **Iterate if needed**: If the initial research reveals new questions or missing information, dispatch another batch of targeted sub-tasks.

{"example_id":16,"prompt":[{"content":"In a 2013 volume of a journal focused on natural medicines from China, a discovery was reported.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation.

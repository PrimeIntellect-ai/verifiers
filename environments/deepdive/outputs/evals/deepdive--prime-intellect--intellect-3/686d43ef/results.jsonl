A study, published in a prominent forestry journal, delved into the common narratives\u2014the accepted 'truths'\u2014often cited as roadblocks. It synthesized perspectives gathered through in-depth interviews with diverse local stakeholders (industry, agency, community, tribal) across ten representative US sites. One contributor to this work, holding advanced degrees from both the UK and a major Midwestern land-grant university system, had also previously explored the synthesis of environmental guidelines for biomass harvesting and assessed the lifecycle impacts of roundwood logistics in the Great Lakes region. This contributor collaborated with specialists in fire social science based at Forest Service research stations, and academics focused on resource policy and workforce issues affiliated with universities spanning from the Upper Midwest to the Pacific Coast.

The success of this treatment is highly dependent on parameters such as\ntissue electrical properties, applied voltages and spatial relations in placement of electrodes that are used to\nestablish a cell-permeabilizing electric field in target tissue. Non-thermal irreversible electroporation techniques for\nablation of tissue depend similarly on these parameters. In the treatment planning stage, if oversimplified\napproximations for evaluation of electric field are used, such as U\/d (voltage-to-distance ratio), sufficient field\nstrength may not be reached within the entire target (tumor) area, potentially resulting in treatment failure.\n\nResults: In order to provide an aid in education of medical personnel performing electrochemotherapy and\nnon-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation, assist in visualizing the electric field in needle electrode\nelectroporation and the effects of changes in electrode placement, an application has been developed both as a\ndesktop- and a web-based solution. It enables users to position up to twelve electrodes in a plane of adjustable\ndimensions representing a two-dimensional slice of tissue. By means of manipulation of electrode placement, i.e.\nrepositioning, and the changes in electrical parameters, the users interact with the system and observe the\nresulting electrical field strength established by the inserted electrodes in real time. The field strength is calculated\nand visualized online and instantaneously reflects the desired changes, dramatically improving the user friendliness\nand educational value, especially compared to approaches utilizing general-purpose numerical modeling software,\nsuch as finite element modeling packages.\nConclusion: In this paper we outline the need and offer a solution in medical education in the field of\nelectroporation-based treatments, e.g. primarily electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible tissue ablation.\nWe present the background, the means of implementation and the fully functional application, which is the first of\nits kind. While the initial feedback from students that have evaluated this application as part of an e-learning course\nis positive, a formal study is planned to thoroughly evaluate the current version and identify possible future\nimprovements and modifications.\n\nKeywords: Education on electroporation, Electromagnetic field visualization, Applications in subject areas,\nInterdisciplinary projects, Interactive learning environments\n\n* Correspondence: damijan.miklavcic@fe.uni-lj.si\nFaculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Tr\u017ea\u0161ka 25, Ljubljana\nSI-1000, Slovenia\n\n\u00a9 2012 Mahnic-Kalamiza et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Electroporation\nmainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly\ncomposed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short\nand intense electric fields. The physical mechanism\nresponsible for increased permeability is thought to be\nthe formation of nano-scale defects termed pores (thus\nelectroporation)\nin the lipid structure [3,4]. This\nallows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact\nmechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is\ntoo high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not\ninstead\nresult in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversif the cells\nible electroporation. On the other hand,\nsurvive,\nincreased permeability of membrane is only\ntemporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible\nelectroporation. This observed transient\nincrease in\npermeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of\napplications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA)\nfusion of\nintroduction of drugs into cells,\ndelivery,\ncells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer,\ngene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of\ndrugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6,7] for an overview. In these\napplications viability of the porated cells is important\nand thus irreversible electroporation is consciously\navoided and generally considered to be an undesired\nside effect. However, there are also interesting medical\napplications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as\nnon-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering\nthe domains of industrial [9,10] and environmental [11]\napplications.\n\nElectrochemotherapy\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that\nsuccessfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs.\nFor successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate\namplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and\nshape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake\nand hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or\npoorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been\nidentified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13,14]. The transport of bleomycin across the\n\nnonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited\n[15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and\nDNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity\nof bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several\nthousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is\nthe electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent\nincrease in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to\nreach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17,18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be\neradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be\ni.e. all cells in the tumor have to be\npermeabilized,\nexposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means\nthat the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends\non both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high\nelectric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we\nmust consider before we can confidently assume we\nhave successfully electroporated the entire tumor area.\nFirst, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue\nelectrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity\ncompared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric\nfield strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields\nin the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue\nof electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their\nshape, size and position. In general, there are two types\nof electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate\nelectrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with\neither a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two\nplates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively,\nwhich ensures good electrical contact, but has other\ndrawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure\ngood electrical contact and optimal distance between\nelectrodes to fit the tumor [21,22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous\nand dependent on their diameter,\ndistance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013\nthe task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even\nmore arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19,24] and in vivo studies [25] on\nimportance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need\nfor careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted\nby a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in\nthe ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of\nElectrochemotherapy) project,\nin the scope of which\nstandard operating procedures for ECT were published\n\n\n\n---\n\nMahnic-Kalamiza et al.

However,\nin advanced cases such as intracranial\n[27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need\nfor patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29,30].\n\ntissue, non-thermal\n\nNon-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue\nablation and other techniques\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation.\nWhile the high number of applied pulses used to\nachieve classical\nirreversible electroporation may also\ncause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the\nirreversible\ncurrent-conducting\nelectroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since\nit results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and\nno protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical\napplications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is\ntechnically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of\nchemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison\nto other ablation methods such as RF ablation or\ncryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the\nconnective structure [8,32]. Since it has been observed\nthat NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves,\nthere is hope of using this technique in treatment of\ntumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as\nthis treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of\nECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure\nadequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other\nminimally invasive therapies for treatment of deepseated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g.\nhigh intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation\nand radiofrequency ablation. The latter is a minimally\ninvasive procedure where a needle electrode is inserted\npercutaneously into a tumor, much as in ECT or NTIRE.\nThe electrode acts as an antenna for electromagnetic\nwaves emitted by a generator; the tumor is heated up\nand thereby destroyed [34]. As with NTIRE or ECT, the\nneed for accurate needle placement exists and its importance has been evaluated. Success,\nimproved\ntreatment, has been proven to be correlated to the experience of the operator [34].\n\ni.e.\n\nThe need for education on electroporation\nAs outlined in the paragraphs above, both reversible and\nirreversible electroporation are promising approaches in\ntreating solid tumors, however their success is highly\ndependent on local field strength. Poorly defined or unknown properties such as tissue conductivities and\n\ninhomogeneities in addition to our choice of electrode\ntype, positions and pulse amplitudes, affect the electric\nfield distribution. With many factors to take into consideration, we may dismiss important uncontrolled variables or use a well-studied but irrelevant model that\ncannot be applied to a specific situation. An example of\nthis is the persistent use of a very simple approximation\nfor electric field strength that holds only under very particular conditions. This frequently used approximation\nequates the electric field strength E to the voltage U applied on the electrodes divided by the distance d between the electrodes, i.e. E \u2248 U\/d. Since the local electric\nfield strength has been identified as the key factor in\nachieving both reversible and irreversible electroporation\n(see [19] for details), i.e. local E has to reach a certain\nthreshold value Erev or Eirrev, it is the parameter we most\noften optimize our electrode configuration for. There is\na problem, however, since this simple relation is strictly\nvalid only in an isotropic homogeneous medium between two infinitely large parallel plate electrodes. When\nusing parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this\nsimple model best approximates the actual field strength\nfar from the electrode edges, provided the electrode\nwidth is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results\nare even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of\ncourse there are no parallel plates to speak of (see\nFigure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore,\nusing the simple parallel plate approximation for E in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result\nin significant reduction of response in treatment for\nwhich the complete response rate has been shown to be\nas high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way\ninto more and more clinics worldwide [36-39] and\nestablishing themselves as safe and effective treatments\nit is becoming more and more important\nof cancer,\nthat medical personnel performing and planning ECT\n(or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action,\nthe underlying physics and possible pitfalls. This\npaper presents an application for visualization and\nanalysis of\nthe electric field strength in multipleneedle-electrode electroporation aimed at users with\nbasic knowledge of the principles of electroporation,\nbut lack of education in physics and engineering who\ninteractive and didactic\nmay therefore need visual,\ninstruments to gain a deeper understanding of\nthe\nprinciples necessary for effective use of these promising treatments. Since educational applications of the\nsort are scarce and research is focused primarily on\nadvancing the field rather than educating, the need\nto explore options and applications in this area of engineering education seems pressing and applicative\n\n\n\n---\n\nMahnic-Kalamiza et al.

We have omitted the detailed\nmathematical derivations here as they are outside the\nscope of this paper; however, we have included a derivation of the equations below in the Appendix for those\nreaders that may be interested in further development\nor modifications to our model. Below, we specify only\nthe final formulation of the mathematical model and\nthe method of application of this analytical solution\ninto the field-calculating engine that represents the\ncore of Application for Visualization of Target Tissue\n\nin Electroporation (ApiVizTEP), since this is the only\nessential part of the application around which the user\ninterface is built. Similarly to the approach that we\nin this paper, other analytical models have\npresent\nbeen developed previously using complex analysis. For\na six-needle array, one may find a first-order analytical\napproximation for the electric field strength in [42].\nOther authors have expanded on this approach further,\nsee e.g. [43] and [44]; however, these solutions do not\ngive an accurate analytical expression for the electric\nfield strength since quite possibly such a solution cannot be obtained for three or more electrodes active\nconcurrently at a given time. Since currently electroporation devices mostly power only one pair of electrodes at a time [45], we have not pursued a solution\nwith more than two concurrently active electrodes, thus\navoiding the derivation of an approximate solution. Instead, we give an accurate solution for a two needle electrode system that\nis not based (mathematically) on\npreviously published work.\nThe accurate analytical\n\nsolution for electric field\nstrength of two long parallel cylindrical conductors (needle electrodes) on a plane perpendicular to the conductor longitudinal axis (2-D solution), is given by the\nfollowing equation\n\n\n\n---\n\nMahnic-Kalamiza et al.

This contributor often works between an institution symbolizing Sino-Japanese cooperation and a prominent capital university specializing in traditional medicine, though for this specific lung-focused paper published mid-decade, the collaborators hailed exclusively from the latter institution."},"answer":"Professor ZHANG Daizhao's Knowledge of the Pathogenesis of Lung Cancer Based on Data Mining Technology","judge_reward_func":0.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0722543184,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":9.0,"prompt_tokens":0.0,"completion_tokens":0.0,"total_tool_calls":8.0}

This issue spurred the development of new remote access protocols. One such intermediate protocol, which verified a user's ability to receive mail before allowing them to send, was itself superseded. This successor protocol, standardizing sender login, is fundamental to the operation of a type of software agent that processes outgoing mail from the user's application, often using a distinct, designated communication channel. This agent, in turn, cooperates with a different agent for the actual routing of messages between various computer systems. While this routing agent functions in the background, the end-user interacts directly with software acting on their behalf. If such user-facing software, exemplified by a web navigation application on a specific model of tablet computer from the early 2010s, transmits an identification string, what particular sequence of characters and numbers, denoting the core rendering engine technology it is built upon, would appear after the details specifying the device and its operating system, but before any mention of compatibility with other rendering engines?\nReason step by step using the given tools and provide the final answer in \\boxed{}.","role":"user"}],"completion":[{"content":"I need to trace through the evolution of email protocols to understand what the question is asking for.

{"example_id":17,"prompt":[{"content":"In the mid-1990s, from a Belgian hub known for both strong theoretical physics and burgeoning interdisciplinary neural studies, came a paper published in a journal dedicated to statistical mechanics. One researcher involved had previously delved into the mathematical landscapes of quantum scattering across dimensions and explored indices tied to supersymmetry.

{"example_id":18,"prompt":[{"content":"Identify the precise title of a 2020 publication featured in an IET journal focused on power generation and distribution. This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

In Norwegian culture, some of the most important values are tolerance, respect and equality. Study abroad in Norway Host a Norwegian student in the U.S.\nQ: Is Norway a multicultural society?\nA: Today's Norway is characterized by global migration flows that have contributed to making society more visibly multicultural.\nQ: How inclusive is Norway?\nA: Norway does consistently well at closing the gender gap \u2013 whether on access to education, labour force participation or income. The ratio of women to men in the job market is 0.95, while the ratio of female to male earned income is 0.79. Norway ranks fourth out of 30 advanced economies on both counts.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":0.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":29456.728219986,"scoring_ms":339.9622440338,"total_ms":29796.6904640198,"info":{"raw_question":"Published in a prominent international heritage journal around 2012, this Norwegian study examines the gap between official criteria and community-driven motivations for preserving cultural sites, particularly those not deemed nationally significant, including structures once central to rural education.

They do this by adsorbing at the air-water interface and forming a monolayer. This monolayer lowers the cohesive forces between liquid's molecules, and as a result, the surface tension is lowered.\nQ: What is the mechanism of action of surfactin?\nA: Surfactin is an amphiphilic molecule that destabilizes membranes and disrupts their integrity [28]. The mechanisms of action are as follows: insertion into lipid bilayers, chelation of monovalent and divalent cations or modification of membrane permeability by formation of channels [29].\nMar 14, 2023","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_373992f35ac746559aed5cc0\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"surfactin\\\\\\\" 1994 \\\\\\\"alkyl ester\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Claude Bernard\\\\\\\" Lyon\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": \\\"10\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"surfactin\" 1994 \"alkyl ester\" \"Claude Bernard\" Lyon","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_7d9507512737407abce99c6b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"surfactin 1994 esterification Claude Bernard University Lyon\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": \\\"10\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Top 12 papers published in the topic of Surfactin in 1994 - SciSpace\nURL: https:\/\/scispace.com\/topics\/surfactin-q3sb356e\/1994\nClaude Bernard University Lyon 1 1, Centre ... 31 Mar 1994 ...

Worldwide hepatitis viral infections represent the major cause liver fibrosis; however, within the United States chronic ethanol consumption is the leading cause of hepatic fibrosis. Other known stimuli for liver fibrosis include helminthic infection, iron or copper overload and biliary obstruction. Fibrosis can be classified as a wound healing response to a variety of chronic stimuli that is characterized by an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins of which type I collagen predominates. This excess deposition of extracellular matrix proteins disrupts the normal architecture of the liver resulting in pathophysiological damage to the organ. If left untreated fibrosis can progress to liver cirrhosis ultimately leading to organ failure and death if left untreated. This review will discuss the molecular events leading to liver fibrosis. The discussion will include collagen gene regulation and proliferative signals that contribute to the amplification of the hepatic stellate cell, the primary fibrogenic cell type that resides in the liver.\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## Grants and funding\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Other Literature Sources\n\n### Medical","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_d1d052c282564e4790cde96f\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"hepatic stellate cell signaling 1999\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": \\\"10\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Intracellular signaling pathways in stellate cell activation - PubMed\nURL: https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/10371415\/\nThis paper will summarize the experimental evidence that implicates these pathways in stellate cell activation, focusing on the effects of exposure to platelet ...\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Intracellular Signaling Pathways in Stellate Cell Activation - 1999\nURL: https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1530-0277.1999.tb04204.x\nThis paper will summarize the experimental evidence that implicates these pathways in stellate cell activation, focusing on the effects of ...\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation... - Hepatology\nURL: https:\/\/journals.lww.com\/hep\/abstract\/1999\/10000\/extracellular_signal_regulated_kinase_activation.19.aspx\nUpon liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) show increased proliferation, motility, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production.\n\n---\n\nResult 3: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation ... - PubMed\nURL: https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/10498647\/\nUpon liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) show increased proliferation, motility, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production.\n\n---\n\nResult 4: Glutathione Levels Discriminate between Oxidative Stress and ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021925819534767\nGlutathione Levels Discriminate between Oxidative Stress and Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b2 Signaling in Activated Rat Hepatic Stellate Cells* ...

Continued fibrosis is thought to be responsible for the development of cirrhosis and liver cancer.\nQ: Do stellate cells cause fibrosis?\nA: Importantly, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a key role in the initiation, progression, and regression of liver fibrosis by secreting fibrogenic factors that encourage portal fibrocytes, fibroblasts, and bone marrow-derived myofibroblasts to produce collagen and thereby propagate fibrosis.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_1e3ae1933a5b4875ac5164f8\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"Stellate cell activation in alcoholic fibrosis--an overview\\\\\\\" Friedman 1999\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": \\\"5\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Stellate cell activation in alcoholic fibrosis - An overview - Icahn ...\nURL: https:\/\/scholars.mssm.edu\/en\/publications\/stellate-cell-activation-in-alcoholic-fibrosis-an-overview-2\/\nFriedman, Scott L. \/ Stellate cell activation in alcoholic fibrosis - An overview.

{"example_id":27,"prompt":[{"content":"Consider a specific composer's early 1960s arrangement of a country's traditional song, an arrangement written for a specific cultural event and later played at the opening of important performance spaces. One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment.

The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger\u2019s causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nStroke is the second-leading cause of death and a major cause disability worldwide (Feigin, 2021) and, in particular, ischemic stroke constituted 62.4% of all new strokes in 2019. Focal stroke lesions affecting either cortical and sub-cortical neurons or descending fiber tracts may affect the neural processing in the motor network (Ward and Cohen, 2004; Stinear et al., 2007). This leads to motor deficit, mainly caused by hemiparesis, that is one of the most common stroke-related disabilities (Katan and Luft, 2018). Nevertheless, it has been observed that patients with initially mild to moderate motor impairments may show substantial recovery of the motor function within the first 3 months after stroke onset. This may be driven by neural plasticity and reorganization, which can occur in the brain also far from the lesion site (Nudo, 2006; Cramer, 2008; Rehme and Grefkes, 2013).\n\nTo investigate cortical functional reorganization, connectivity models based on the concept that the brain is organized in specialized anatomically distinct areas functionally integrated in networks (Friston, 2002) were applied to neuroimaging techniques, both in experimental and computational simulation studies (Falcon et al., 2016; Allegra Mascaro et al., 2020). Functional connectivity is usually inferred by means of correlations among measurements of neuronal activity neglecting information on the coupling direction, whereas the directed functional connectivity investigates the causal influence that a brain region exerts over another (Friston, 2011; Barrett and Barnett, 2013). In the literature, the analysis of cortical directed and undirected functional connectivity has been extensively used to characterize the brain connections and investigate rehabilitation effects on patients after stroke events (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Connectivity studies can be carried out during both task and resting state conditions, the latter being the easiest protocol executable also for patients in the acute stage. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that changes in resting state connectivity, especially in the motor network, are predictive of motor function recovery in stroke patients (James et al., 2009; Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Volz et al., 2016; Hordacre et al., 2020).\n\nAmong neuroimaging techniques, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was one of the first employed to investigate brain connectivity. Given its high spatial resolution and the provided volumetric information, fMRI allows investigation of connections involving both cortical and deep structures in the brain (Farr and Wegener, 2010). Electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed as a valid alternative technique, as it allowed to reconstruct known resting state networks from signals acquired by scalp electrodes in healthy subjects (Mantini et al., 2007). Despite its lower spatial resolution, EEG offers a higher time resolution with respect to fMRI, allowing to better track the fast reconfiguration of neuronal networks and to extract information on the spectral characteristics of the functional networks related to specific brain rhythms. Moreover, it exploits cheaper and portable instrumentation, allowing measurements both on healthy and pathological subjects, also accessible in complex medical setting (Borich et al., 2015).\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, a plethora of measures and indexes have been proposed to infer both functional and causal connectivity from EEG recordings (Pereda et al., 2005), including bivariate and conditional Granger causality (GC), transfer entropy (TE), directed transfer function (DTF), directed coherence (DC), partial directed coherence (PDC) and dynamical Bayesian inference. Each of these metrics may be sensitive to different aspects of the neurophysiological data, evidenced either in time or frequency domains or through linear or non-linear relationships. Therefore, the choice of a metric over another depends on the particular aspect of interest in the connectivity network; moreover, the reliability of a specific metric can depend on different factors related to the specific application, such as the stationarity of the signal, non-linear effects or indirect connections among networks nodes. Different causal connectivity metrics can lead to different results and careful interpretation is required. Usually, only one metric is chosen to retrieve networks\u2019 topology and infer the spectral content of the information flow between network nodes. However, the use of a single metric cannot guarantee a comprehensive description of the network (Blinowska, 2011). For instance, GC and TE provide compact information on the overall information flow between network nodes, while DTF, DC and PDC focus on specific rhythms of physiological interest (Sameshima and Baccal\u00e1, 2014; Seth et al., 2015); bivariate GC\/TE and DC detect the overall flow of information from one node to another, while conditional GC\/TE and DTF\/PDC elicit direct connections but may lose ability to capture the coupling strength (Faes et al., 2012). Finally, the dynamical Bayesian inference approach has been proposed to assess the cross-frequency coupling strength both in neural networks and among different physiological systems, e.g., cardio-respiratory-cortical interactions (Stankovski et al., 2016). Until now, an agreed standard measure to assess EEG-based causal connectivity is not univocally employed in the literature, and the selection of the most appropriate measure still represents an open issue.\n\nMoreover, in the context of EEG analysis, causal connectivity was often identified directly from the electrodes signal, but it has been demonstrated that connectivity computed in the electrode space is affected by the scalp volume-conduction effect and the obtained results can be hardly interpreted as real brain connectivity (Hassan and Wendling, 2018; Marinazzo et al., 2019; Van de Steen et al., 2019). On the contrary, meaningful connectivity patterns can be derived from cortical source activities extracted from EEG inverse solutions (Michel and Murray, 2012; Haufe et al., 2013).\n\nAlthough the effects of stroke on resting-state brain connectivity have been widely investigated, especially in the acute phase with respect to healthy subjects, a limited number of works focused specifically on longitudinal effects of motor rehabilitation on the reorganization of the cortical motor network after stroke. Moreover, the majority of studies exploited fMRI to assess functional, non-directed connectivity (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Considering EEG analysis, up to now, the majority of studies explored functional connectivity in post-stroke populations in both acute (Caliandro et al., 2017; Vecchio et al., 2019a, 2019b; Fanciullacci et al., 2021; Hoshino et al., 2021) and chronic stages (Gerloff et al., 2006; De Vico Fallani et al., 2009, 2017; Wu et al., 2015; Hordacre et al., 2020; Molteni et al., 2020; Waterstone et al., 2020; Romeo et al., 2021); only fewer studies investigated the resting-state causal connectivity after stroke (Guo et al., 2014; Pichiorri et al., 2015, 2018; Calabr\u00f2 et al., 2018; Nicolo et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021). The few studies cited above employing EEG rarely focused on the investigation of the motor network, preferring a large-scale connectivity analysis of the whole brain with synthetic descriptors. Even though this type of information can serve as a general indication on the state of brain\u2019s connections after stroke, information about power spectral strength or flow direction in the identified connections are often missing. This type of information can be obtained by separate connectivity metrics computed from electrodes or brain sources signals and whose underlying interpretation should be carefully considered to compare the results between different studies.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, the investigation of motor network directed functional connectivity by means of EEG in sub-acute stroke patients should be deepened from both methodological and application perspectives. To this aim, in this work we perform an EEG-based longitudinal study of resting-state causal connectivity in a population of sub-acute stroke patients with motor impairment who underwent a rehabilitation treatment. We focus on the characterization of the motor network exploiting the cortical source signals reconstructed from EEG scalp recordings and using two different connectivity metrics, i.e., the Directed Coherence (DC) and the generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Combining the information carried by these two measures, we aim to provide a description of the variations induced by treatment in both the topography and the transfer of spectral power along the identified functional connections, investigating also possible correlations with the clinical assessment of motor recovery.\n\nIn Section 2, a detailed description of the participants enrolled for this study and the methodology followed is presented. In Section 3, the obtained results are reported and their discussion can be found in Section 4. Section 5 draws conclusions of the work.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1 Population Description\n\nEighteen subjects (age 67 \u00b1 10, seven females and 11 males) in the sub-acute stage after ischemic stroke were enrolled for this study. Inclusion criteria were age less than 80 years old, first unilateral stroke, distance from acute event less than 30 days, with no other concomitant orthopedic or rheumatologic disease, without global or comprehension aphasia, right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. Each subject was evaluated twice: firstly, at the admission to the rehabilitation center (T0, on average after 12 \u00b1 5 days from the stroke event) and secondly at the end of the rehabilitation treatment (T1, on average after 55 \u00b1 11 days from the event). In Table 1, details about participants\u2019 characteristics are reported. To participate, each subject signed a written informed consent. The study was reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee \u201cComitato Etico Provinciale dell\u2019Insubria\u201d and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nPatients followed a rehabilitation treatment for both upper and lower limb recovery: each patient underwent to a rehabilitation treatment twice per day, each session lasting 45 min. Training was tailored according to patients\u2019 residuals motor capacity and it included exercise for upper and lower limbs. Lower and upper limbs stretching, lower and upper limbs muscle strengthening, static and dynamic balance exercises, proprioception exercises, trunk control exercise, gait at the parallel bars or in clinical open spaces were the exercise performed.\n\n### 2.2 Functional Assessment\n\nClinical evaluations were performed by clinicians, i.e., physiotherapist and medical doctor. To assess the upper limb performance the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) (Fugl-Meyer et al., 1975) before and after treatment was used. The FMA motor score ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 66 (upper limb normal motor performance). As for the lower limb, the level of walking ability was assessed by the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC). This gait assessment scale distinguishes six levels of walking ability based on the amount of physical support required. The lowest level 0 indicates a patient who is not able to walk, while level 5, indicates a patient who can walk everywhere independently, including stairs (Holden et al., 1984). Participants\u2019 scores assigned at T0 and T1 for both clinical scales, i.e., FMAT0, FMAT1, FAC T0 and FAC T1, are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe variations \u0394FMA = FMAT1\u2013FMAT0 and \u0394FAC = FACT1\u2013FACT0 was considered as primary clinical outcomes of subject\u2019s motor recovery.\n\n### 2.3 EEG Data Acquisition\n\nResting state EEG recordings were performed with the Neuroscan system (Compumedics Neuroscan, Compumedics, NC, United States) using 64 Ag\/AgCl electrodes placed according to the International 10\/20 standard system. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz, with the reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz positions and the ground electrode positioned anterior to Fz. During the acquisition, patients were asked to keep their eyes closed in a sitting relaxed position for at least 5 min. As for functional assessment, EEG recordings were repeated twice, before (T0) and after (T1) the rehabilitation treatment.\n\n### 2.4 EEG Data Analysis\n\nIn Figure 1, a scheme of the principal steps followed for the analysis of single EEG recordings is reported. Three main stages can be identified: EEG signal pre-processing, current sources reconstruction and directed functional connectivity. In the scheme, inputs and outputs of each block are highlighted. Detailed explanation of each step is provided in the following sections.\n\n**FIGURE 1**. Pipeline of single acquisition and analysis. Abbreviations: MVAR, multivariate auto-regressive; DC, Directed Coherence; gPDC, generalized partial directed coherence.\n\n##### 2.4.1 EEG Pre-Processing\n\nEEG signals were pre-processed offline in Matlab environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) using the open source EEGLab signal processing Toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).\n\nData were down-sampled at 128 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 45 Hz to remove slow drifts and high-frequency components, such as the power line noise. Flat and \u201cbad\u201d channels were removed for further analysis. A flat channel was identified if it showed amplitude around zero (flatline) for more than 5 s consecutively, whereas a channel was identified as \u201cbad\u201d if it was noisy for more than 90% of the acquisition duration. An Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm (Mullen et al., 2015) was applied to all retained channels to identify and remove transient or high-amplitude artifacts, e.g., eye movements. According to Chang and others (Chang et al., 2020), the application of this cleaning approach improves the accuracy of subsequent Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The ASR algorithm automatically identifies clean periods of the EEG data using a sliding window. An artifact rejection threshold is calculated, based on the calibration signal distribution of variance and a user-defined cut-off parameter. Data portions, whose variance is larger than this threshold, are removed and reconstructed from neighboring channels using a covariance matrix computed from the calibration data. According to the cut-off parameter *k* chosen by the user, the method can be more or less aggressive in removing EEG components portions of data. In this work, *k* = 20 was employed, according to the range suggested by Chang and others, who validated the ASR method on real EEG data and found that a *k* in the range 10\u2013100 allows removing ocular artifacts still preserving cerebral components (Chang et al., 2020). Furthermore, ICA was applied to the ASR-cleaned EEG recordings exploiting the RUNICA Infomax algorithm as implemented in EEGLab (Makeig and Bell, 1996). RUNICA un-mixes the EEG recordings in cortical and non-cortical spatially distinct and temporally independent components (IC). Once the non-cortical components are identified and removed, the final cleaned EEG signal can be reconstructed. To guide the selection of ICs accounting for non-brain (artifactual) activities the ICLabel plugin was employed (Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019). It is an automated classifier which provides an estimation of the type of each of the IC (brain, eye, muscle, line noise, etc.) based on some component characteristics, i.e., power spectrum, its time-course, topography dipole localization and percentage data variance accounted in the considered component. A final visual check of the signals was performed. The originally removed \u201cbad\u201d channels were then reconstructed by the interpolation of the neighbor channels signals, thus obtaining a uniform EEG spatial sampling. Finally, EEG data were re-referenced to a common average reference and 1 min of cleaned, artifact-free 60 channels EEG was selected for all subjects.\n\n##### 2.4.2 Individual Alpha Frequency\n\nTo improve the accuracy of the EEG analysis in the frequency domain, the interindividual variability of the alpha rhythm peak was considered for the determination of the spectral bands of interest, as proposed by Klimesch in 1999 (Klimesch, 1999). In particular, for the purpose of this study, we focused our analysis on alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands, which are reported as the most involved in motor system functions (Pfurtscheller et al., 1994, 1996). After computing the power spectral density (PSD) for the parieto-occipital channels by the Welch method (Welch, 1967), the Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF) was determined as the average peak position in the spectral range 7.5\u201312.5 Hz. The average IAF found in our population was equal to 9.07 \u00b1 0.99 Hz. The IAF was used to define the alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands as follow: \u03b1 = [IAF-2 Hz \u00f7 IAF+2 Hz] and \u03b2 = [IAF+2.5 Hz \u00f7 IA\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_fc398a4bd2134448a0e3fb92\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"Irene Pirovano autonomic nervous system ECG diffusion MRI magnetization transfer London collaboration\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] 2000 Proceedings CD-ROM - ISMRM\nURL: https:\/\/cds.ismrm.org\/protected\/01Meeting\/program.pdf\nMagnetization Transfer MRI.

The performance of the patients was compared with that of a control group consisting of eight subjects with no history of neurological deficits.\n\n**\nResults:\n**\nPatients with neglect as well as patients clinically recovered from neglect showed aberrant search performance in the virtual reality (VR) task, such as mixed search pattern, repeated target pressures and deviating hand movements. The results indicate that in patients with a right hemispheric stroke, this VR application can provide an additional tool for assessment that can identify small variations otherwise not detectable with standard paper-and-pencil tests.\n\n**\nConclusion:\n**\nVR technology seems to be well suited for the assessment of visually guided manual exploration in space.\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Full Text Sources\n\n### Other Literature Sources\n\n### Medical","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_1097c6e815114c8a9e83d3b0\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"num_results\\\": \\\"10\\\", \\\"query\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"Neglect assessment as an application of virtual reality\\\\\\\" Broeren 2007 Gothenburg authors\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Neglect assessment as an application of virtual reality\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/6126295_Neglect_assessment_as_an_application_of_virtual_reality\nNeglect assessment as an application of virtual reality.

The present work has been developed in the context of the German Medical Informatics Initiative, where 29 university hospitals agreed to the usage of the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for their newly established data integration centers. This standard is optimized to describe and exchange medical data but less suitable for standard statistical analysis which mostly requires tabular data formats.\n\n**Objectives**\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analysis by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should be implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts and offer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n**Methods**\nWe propose the fhircrackr framework, which allows downloading and flattening FHIR resources for data analysis. The framework supports different download and authentication protocols and gives the user full control over the data that is extracted from the FHIR resources and transformed into tables. We implemented it using the programming language R [1] and published it under the GPL-3 open source license.\n\n**Results**\nThe framework was successfully applied to both publicly available test data and real-world data from several ongoing studies. While the processing of larger real-world data sets puts a considerable burden on computation time and memory consumption, those challenges can be attenuated with a number of suitable measures like parallelization and temporary storage mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe fhircrackr R package provides an open source solution within an environment that is familiar to most data scientists and helps overcome the practical challenges that still hamper the usage of EHR data for research.\n\n**Keywords:** Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, electronic health records, health information interoperability, data analysis\n\n## Background and Significance\n\n### Background\n\nThe digitalization of the health sector produces a growing interest in the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for clinical research. With the rise of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the need to share large-scale, near real-time patient data has shifted into focus 1 2 3 and there has been increasing activity in building new infrastructures 4 5 for data integration and data sharing.\n\nIn the context of this growing activity, the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard 6 has developed into one of the most popular interoperability standards worldwide. From the creation of FHIR profiles 7 to the mapping 8 and usage of the FHIR standard for data sharing, data visualization, and data quality assessment, 9 10 11 12 13 a vast number of projects using FHIR continues to grow all over the world.\n\nFollowing this trend, the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) 14 established 29 data integration centers in university hospitals across four consortia to integrate EHR data using FHIR. The FHIR standard focuses on the exchange of health care data and defines around 160 so-called resource types, each of which stands for a distinct entity of information that can be transferred using standard web technologies. 15 While FHIR is well-established as a standard in clinical data exchange, for example, for medical applications, Duda et al 16 have found that it is less commonly used in clinical research. Since FHIR is optimized to describe and transfer medical data of individual patients, it is less tailored to statistical analysis of patient cohorts and other applications requiring tabular data. FHIR resources are represented as interlinked JSON or XML objects instead of the matrix-like structures and cannot be handled by most statistical software. The proposed framework is based on the XML representation of FHIR, which is also used throughout this article.\n\nWe developed a framework for extracting and reshaping data from FHIR resources using the well-established XPath expression language, 17 which allows analysts to create tables from FHIR data that can be processed by any standard statistical or other software that expects tabular data. The framework is implemented in the open-source R package 18 fhircrackr 19 and can be downloaded from the comprehensive R archive network. 20\n\nIn the remainder of this article, we will introduce the basics of the FHIR standard followed by a conceptual description of how the fhircrackr framework builds on this standard. Then, we will illustrate the framework with a reproducible example using open access test data and conclude with a discussion of the framework in light of currently ongoing studies, which use real-world EHR data for statistical analyses in several areas of biomedical research.\n\n### FHIR Basics\n\nThe FHIR standard is used to describe data originating from clinical routine documentation. In this standard, all data elements are represented as so-called FHIR resources. A single FHIR resource holds a specific piece of information like a laboratory measurement, demographic information on a patient, or the description of a medical procedure. A full list of currently defined FHIR resources can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/resourcelist.html*\n. Two simplified examples are shown in\nFig. 1\n, where information on a patient and a measurement of her body temperature are represented in the form of a Patient resource and an Observation resource, respectively.\n\nIdeally, every FHIR resource holds the machine-readable information that is needed to interpret the data including its provenance, the actual data point (e.g., the body temperature measured), the metadata (e.g., the unit and date), and references to other resources the data relates to (e.g., the patient the temperature is taken from). The nested structure of the resource is needed because EHR data, like other kinds of data that is exchanged in discrete units, has an inherently nested structure. In the FHIR R4, the most recent version of the standard, there are around 160 resource types, each of them devoted to a specific kind of medical information. In theory, each FHIR resource is individually retrievable from the server, but for statistical analysis, they are mostly downloaded in bundles. A FHIR bundle is a collection of multiple resources that can be exchanged and processed as a single entity. The FHIR standard is a RESTful specification, which uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication. To download data from the server, the standard describes the so-called FHIR Search paradigm, in which the user specifies the scope of the downloaded data with suitable search parameters and downloads the respective resources using HTTP GET or POST. The details of this paradigm are beyond the scope of this article, however, extensive documentation can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/search.html*\n.\n\nThe structure of the FHIR standard stands in contrast to data formats that are usually employed in data analysis. Most statistical software expects a matrix-like structure, where columns represent features and rows represent observations on the set of features formed by those columns. A single body temperature measurement, for example, could be one cell in a matrix that has patients in rows and measurements of vital signs in columns. In contrast, the FHIR representation of this single cell would be an entire json\/xml object that contains not only the measured temperature value but also references to the patient it is taken from and other metadata. Information that is contained in a single table in a classical data analysis setting is expressed in a large number of interlinked resources when the data is represented in FHIR. Developing a framework bridging the gap between those two representations is the primary goal of this work.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analyses by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should have the following characteristics:\n\nBuild on the communication interface defined by HL7 FHIR.\n\nSupport common authentication protocols used for sensitive data.\n\nBe implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts.\n\nOffer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n\n## Methods\n\nTwo steps are necessary to make FHIR data available for analysis: (1) download the data from the server and (2) transform the data into a table format. To perform those tasks, the fhircrackr framework defines a set of classes and related functions, an overview over which can be found in Fig. 2 . Below, we will describe the necessary steps sequentially.\n\n### Downloading FHIR Data\n\nTo access FHIR data, the fhircrackr framework builds on the FHIR Search paradigm defined by HL7. The framework provides functionalities for the construction of FHIR search expressions via the function\n*fhir_url()*\nand uses the function\n*fhir_search()*\nto download the bundles.\n*fhir_search()*\nallows for basic authentication and Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0\n21\n) as well as automatic paging (sequential download of search result bundles) when the result is distributed over several bundles. Downloads can be done via GET or POST, depending on the use case, and can easily be parallelized when necessary. See\nFig. 3\nfor a representation of the downloading workflow. The downloading functions build on well-established functions from the httr-Package,\n22\nbut extend them by providing mechanisms for automatic paging as well as helper functions for building valid FHIR search requests and handling of common errors. The result of the downloading process is a list of FHIR bundles, which is represented as an S4 class\n23\ncalled\n*fhir_bundle_list*\n. Within this list, a single bundle is an object of class\n*fhir_bundle_xml*\n, an S4 class extending\n*xml_document*\nfrom the xml2 R package.\n24\nThe FHIR bundles can be transformed into tables (referred to as \u201cflattening\u201d) as described in the next section.\n\n### Flattening FHIR Data\n\n#### Resource Types\n\nDepending on the type of search request, a FHIR bundle can contain more than one resource type. When the resources are flattened, the fhircrackr framework constructs one table for each resource type, as shown in Fig. 4 . This is necessary because the variability between resources of different types is larger than the variability between resources of the same type. Putting the data of all resource types in a single table would thus create unreasonably large and sparsely populated tables.\n\n#### Elements to Extract\n\nThere are two modes of flattening the resources, depicted in\nFig. 5\n. Either (1) the entire structure is flattened, that is, every element that occurs in at least one of the resources will be turned into a column of the resulting table, or (2) a predefined subset of the elements is extracted from the resources. The former approach requires little knowledge about the individual structure of the resources but can result in very wide and sparse tables. The latter approach, in contrast, requires some knowledge about the structure of the resources, but will result in more concise and densely populated tables.\nFig. 6\nprovides an overview over the workflow of the flattening process: All information needed to flatten the resources is represented in the class\n*fhir_table_description*\n, which contains the type of resource to target (an object of class\n*fhir_resource_type*\n) and a list of XPath 1.0\n17\nexpressions (an object of class\n*fhir_columns*\n) specifying which elements of the resource to extract into the columns of the resulting table. The function\n*fhir_crack()*\nruns the extraction on all resources in the bundles, with one row being created per resource. If a specified element is not present in one of the resources, the corresponding cell in the resulting table is left empty.\n\nThe generic extraction process based on a user-specified XPath scheme ensures that the framework does not depend on any predefined resource structure, apart from it being valid xml. This has the advantage of making the tool compatible with both standard FHIR resources as well as arbitrary extensions to those resources and makes sure that the tool works on all versions of the FHIR standard, like the past STU3, current R4, and future R5 version.\n\n#### Repeating Elements\n\nTo represent complex EHR data adequately, FHIR resources can contain repeating elements, that is, elements with a cardinality greater than one. The FHIR core specification of the Patient resource, 25 for example, defines a 0* cardinality for the element \u201cPatient.address,\u201d meaning that a single Patient resource can contain zero, one, or multiple address elements. Creating a new column for each instance of the element would greatly inflate the resulting table, as a single resource with 10 address elements would result in 10 address columns. This effect worsens as the number of elements with multiple instances increases. To counteract this issue, the fhircrackr default puts values of repeating elements in the same column, separated by a string that can be defined in the table description, as depicted in Fig. 7 . To be able to tell apart which value belongs to which parent element, the fhircrackr can assign an index to each entry, which is surrounded by prespecified brackets. Together with the XPath or header of the column, the indices allow a reconstruction of the original FHIR structure, including the precise position of every element. We are aware that this default behavior violates the first normal form of database normalization, 26 which states that there should be no columns with sets of values. In consultation with various statisticians, we have however adopted the presented solution, since searching such complex fields in the cases considered here is easier to handle in common statistical packages than distributing the values over several columns or tables.\n\nTo resolve columns with sets of values, the fhircrackr framework provides functionalities to automatically split those values, either into a wide format with multiple columns (called casting), or into a long format with multiple rows (called melting). Fig. 8 illustrates the two approaches: In a cast table, the names of each column reflect the original position of the element and each row represents one resource. In a molten table, the number of columns stays the same and multiple entries are spread over several rows. As opposed to casting, melting is done with respect to a specific element (the address element in this example) and values from all other elements (e.g., the id element) are copied into the newly created rows. Fig. 9 represents the workflow of casting or melting a table with multiple entries.\n\nThe steps described so far only aim at making the data available in tabular form. In addition, common techniques of data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization should precede any statistical analysis, which however is beyond the scope of this article. A good summary of those methods specifically for EHR data is given by Yu et al. 27\n\n#### Recreating Resources\n\nApart from turning FHIR resources into flat tables, the fhircrackr framework also allows data to flow in the opposite direction, creating FHIR resources from flat tables. Because the framework is able to remember the original structure of the resources through column headers and indexing of entries, it is possible to recreate the original resources from the flattened tables. This allows the user to selectively remove or add single elements as well as running more complex computations to augment the original FHIR resources before sending them back to a server.\n\n### R Package fhircrackr\n\nWe implemented the above functionalities in a package called fhircrackr using the programming language R\n1\nand published it under the GPL-3 open source license on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (see \u201cSoftware Availability\u201d below). The package requires R Version 4.1.0 or higher and can be run on any operating system that can run R. While the package does not have specific hardware requirements and can be operated on a standard office notebook, the actual requirements regarding RAM and CPU strongly depend on the use case and the scope of the data being processed.\n\n## Results\n\n### Application to Test Data\n\nTo illustrate the basic functionalities of the package, we have set up a simple project on publicly available test data\n28\nat\n*https:\/\/github.com\/POLAR-fhiR\/fhircrackr_examples*\n. In this project, we investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and hypertensive disease (ICD-10 Code I10 - I15) diagnosed as a comorbidity in a small patient cohort. To achieve this, we need to (1) compute the BMI for each patient from downloaded Observation resources containing body weight and body height measurements and (2) relate it to the diagnosis information given in the Encounter and Condition resources of those patients. First, the code example shows how the function\n*fhir_url()*\nis used to build the appropriate FHIR search request which is then sent to the server using\n*fhir_search()*\n. The resulting list of FHIR bundles contains Patient and Observation resources. To flatten those resources into tables, two table descriptions are defined as shown in\nFig. 10\n.\n\nThe function\n*fhir_crack()*\nis then used to create the two tables and after some data preprocessing, the BMI is computed and a list of patient IDs is used to download the associated Encounter and Condition resources. According to the MII implementation guide,\n29\nwhich profiles an Encounter in the German health care system that is used in the test data, the diagnoses of a Patient are referenced in the Encounter resource and there can be multiple diagnoses listed in one encounter, as shown in\nFig. 11\n. The table created from those Encounters will therefore contain multiple entries in the diagnosis columns, as shown in the top row of\nFig. 12\n. Those multiple diagnoses have to be spread over multiple rows using\n*fhir_melt()*\n, as shown in the middle row of\nFig. 12\nand subsequently be freed from indices with\n*fhir_rm_indices()*\nas shown in the bottom row of the figure. Then, they can be filtered for comorbidity diagnoses. Finally, the patients with a hypertension comorbidity diagnosis can be identified and the relationship between hypertension and BMI can be examined with suitable statistical routines.\n\n### Application to Real-World Data\n\nTo date, fhircrackr is used in a number of ongoing studies within the German MII. In the use case POLAR 30 it is used for a distributed analysis in 13 university hospitals to detect health risks in patients with polypharmacy. The clinical trial HELP 31 uses the package to evaluate a decision support system for bloodstream infections in five university hospitals. Several smaller studies (e.g., refs. 32 and 33) showcase the usage of the fhircrackr in publicly available GitHub repositories. 34 35\n\nIn all these applications, the analysis is distributed in the form of plain or dockered R scripts via version control platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or DockerHub. The scripts generate tabular data on different levels of abstraction from simple feature extraction to more complex local aggregation for distributed learning approaches. All these approaches are easy to implement once the FHIR data has been made available as tables in R.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Usage of Real-World Data\n\nThe use of nested information from real-world EHR data in data science applications has demonstrated difficulties, and som\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/www.thieme-connect.com\/products\/ejournals\/abstract\/10.1055\/s-0042-1760436\n#### Subscribe to RSS\n\nDOI: 10.1055\/s-0042-1760436\n\n# \u201cfhircrackr\u201d: An R Package Unlocking Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources for Statistical Analysis\n\n## Authors\n\nFunding This work was funded in part by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Medical Informatics Initiative in the SMITH Consortium and the POLAR project under the funding numbers 01ZZ1910[A-Z] (POLAR) and 01ZZ1803[A-Z] (SMITH).\n\n## Abstract\n\nBackground The growing interest in the secondary use of electronic health record (EHR) data has increased the number of new data integration and data sharing infrastructures.

To further reduce surgical trauma, new minimal invasive procedures such as single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) and robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) have emerged. The aim of this study was to compare the early results of SPLS versus RALS in the treatment of rectal cancer.\n\n**\nMethods:\n**\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on patients who had undergone SPLS (n = 36) or RALS (n = 56) in the period between 2010 and 2012. Operative and short-term oncological outcomes were compared.\n\n**\nResults:\n**\nThe RALS group had fewer patients with low rectal cancer and more patients with mid-rectal tumors (P = .017) and also a higher rate of intraoperative complications (14.3% vs 0%, P = .021). The rate of postoperative complications did not differ (P = .62). There were no differences in circumferential resection margins, distal resection margins, or completeness of the mesorectal fascia. The RALS group had a larger number of median harvested lymph nodes (27 vs 13, P = .001). The SPLS group had fewer late complications (P = .025). There were no locoregional recurrences in either of the groups. There was no difference in median follow-up time between groups (P = .58).\n\n**\nConclusion:\n**\nBoth SPLS and RALS may have a role in rectal surgery. The short-term oncological outcomes were similar, although RALS harvested more lymph nodes than the SPLS procedure. However, SPLS seems to be safer with regard to intraoperative and late postoperative complications.\n\n**\nKeywords:\n**\nSILS\/ single site surgery; colorectal surgery; robotic surgery.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Full Text Sources\n\n### Other Literature Sources\n\n# Content from https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/000313481508100337\nError fetching https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/000313481508100337: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/000313481508100337'\n\n# Content from https:\/\/www.sages.org\/meetings\/annual-meeting\/abstracts-archive\/single-port-vs-multiport-laparoscopic-surgery-for-colon-cancer-multicenter-prospective-randomized-trial-in-korea-simple-trial\/\nError fetching https:\/\/www.sages.org\/meetings\/annual-meeting\/abstracts-archive\/single-port-vs-multiport-laparoscopic-surgery-for-colon-cancer-multicenter-prospective-randomized-trial-in-korea-simple-trial\/: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/www.sages.org\/meetings\/annual-meeting\/abstracts-archive\/single-port-vs-multiport-laparoscopic-surgery-for-colon-cancer-multicenter-prospective-randomized-trial-in-korea-simple-trial\/'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_199e0ea6cff94f5d86256512\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"single-port laparoscopic surgery\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"multi-port laparoscopic surgery\\\\\\\" Seoul 2011 2012 cancer\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Comparison of the effects of an ERAS program ...\nURL: https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC6700146\/\nby MK Kim \u00b7 2019 \u00b7 Cited by 35 \u2014 ... single-port laparoscopic surgery was non-inferior to that of multi-port laparoscopic surgery in colon cancer.

This entity established a subsidiary specializing in solar electricity, a field rapidly advancing in a major South Asian nation which notably utilizes building summits for energy capture. These summit-based energy installations are photovoltaic systems that often channel surplus electricity into the broader power grid. A critical electronic device in these grid-integrated setups is responsible for converting the panel's direct current output into alternating current. On a much larger scale, similar current conversion technology is employed in systems designed for bulk power transmission over extensive distances using direct current at very high potentials. Such long-distance systems, which operate with this non-alternating current to reduce energy loss, may, in certain configurations (especially those with a single main conductor), use a specific type of conductor to link to an earth grounding point. What is the characteristic range of operating electrical potential for this specific conductor type?"},"answer":"10-20kV","judge_reward_func":0.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0506143162,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":5.0,"prompt_tokens":0.0,"completion_tokens":0.0,"total_tool_calls":4.0}

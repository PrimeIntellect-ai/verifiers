His work involves examining the standing of such groups, for instance, in a South Asian country where legal codes concerning them stem from a colonial past. That jurisdiction's primary legal framework for offenses, a legacy of its former administrators, was later amended. This amendment was part of a governmental era dedicated to integrating religious tenets into the state's laws. Such integration reportedly heightened friction between two major denominations of a global faith within that territory.

The success of this treatment is highly dependent on parameters such as\ntissue electrical properties, applied voltages and spatial relations in placement of electrodes that are used to\nestablish a cell-permeabilizing electric field in target tissue. Non-thermal irreversible electroporation techniques for\nablation of tissue depend similarly on these parameters. In the treatment planning stage, if oversimplified\napproximations for evaluation of electric field are used, such as U\/d (voltage-to-distance ratio), sufficient field\nstrength may not be reached within the entire target (tumor) area, potentially resulting in treatment failure.\n\nResults: In order to provide an aid in education of medical personnel performing electrochemotherapy and\nnon-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation, assist in visualizing the electric field in needle electrode\nelectroporation and the effects of changes in electrode placement, an application has been developed both as a\ndesktop- and a web-based solution. It enables users to position up to twelve electrodes in a plane of adjustable\ndimensions representing a two-dimensional slice of tissue. By means of manipulation of electrode placement, i.e.\nrepositioning, and the changes in electrical parameters, the users interact with the system and observe the\nresulting electrical field strength established by the inserted electrodes in real time. The field strength is calculated\nand visualized online and instantaneously reflects the desired changes, dramatically improving the user friendliness\nand educational value, especially compared to approaches utilizing general-purpose numerical modeling software,\nsuch as finite element modeling packages.\nConclusion: In this paper we outline the need and offer a solution in medical education in the field of\nelectroporation-based treatments, e.g. primarily electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible tissue ablation.\nWe present the background, the means of implementation and the fully functional application, which is the first of\nits kind. While the initial feedback from students that have evaluated this application as part of an e-learning course\nis positive, a formal study is planned to thoroughly evaluate the current version and identify possible future\nimprovements and modifications.\n\nKeywords: Education on electroporation, Electromagnetic field visualization, Applications in subject areas,\nInterdisciplinary projects, Interactive learning environments\n\n* Correspondence: damijan.miklavcic@fe.uni-lj.si\nFaculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Tr\u017ea\u0161ka 25, Ljubljana\nSI-1000, Slovenia\n\n\u00a9 2012 Mahnic-Kalamiza et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Electroporation\nmainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly\ncomposed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short\nand intense electric fields. The physical mechanism\nresponsible for increased permeability is thought to be\nthe formation of nano-scale defects termed pores (thus\nelectroporation)\nin the lipid structure [3,4]. This\nallows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact\nmechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is\ntoo high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not\ninstead\nresult in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversif the cells\nible electroporation. On the other hand,\nsurvive,\nincreased permeability of membrane is only\ntemporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible\nelectroporation. This observed transient\nincrease in\npermeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of\napplications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA)\nfusion of\nintroduction of drugs into cells,\ndelivery,\ncells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer,\ngene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of\ndrugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6,7] for an overview. In these\napplications viability of the porated cells is important\nand thus irreversible electroporation is consciously\navoided and generally considered to be an undesired\nside effect. However, there are also interesting medical\napplications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as\nnon-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering\nthe domains of industrial [9,10] and environmental [11]\napplications.\n\nElectrochemotherapy\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that\nsuccessfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs.\nFor successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate\namplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and\nshape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake\nand hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or\npoorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been\nidentified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13,14]. The transport of bleomycin across the\n\nnonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited\n[15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and\nDNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity\nof bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several\nthousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is\nthe electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent\nincrease in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to\nreach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17,18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be\neradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be\ni.e. all cells in the tumor have to be\npermeabilized,\nexposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means\nthat the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends\non both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high\nelectric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we\nmust consider before we can confidently assume we\nhave successfully electroporated the entire tumor area.\nFirst, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue\nelectrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity\ncompared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric\nfield strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields\nin the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue\nof electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their\nshape, size and position. In general, there are two types\nof electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate\nelectrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with\neither a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two\nplates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively,\nwhich ensures good electrical contact, but has other\ndrawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure\ngood electrical contact and optimal distance between\nelectrodes to fit the tumor [21,22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous\nand dependent on their diameter,\ndistance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013\nthe task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even\nmore arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19,24] and in vivo studies [25] on\nimportance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need\nfor careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted\nby a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in\nthe ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of\nElectrochemotherapy) project,\nin the scope of which\nstandard operating procedures for ECT were published\n\n\n\n---\n\nMahnic-Kalamiza et al.

However,\nin advanced cases such as intracranial\n[27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need\nfor patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29,30].\n\ntissue, non-thermal\n\nNon-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue\nablation and other techniques\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation.\nWhile the high number of applied pulses used to\nachieve classical\nirreversible electroporation may also\ncause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the\nirreversible\ncurrent-conducting\nelectroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since\nit results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and\nno protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical\napplications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is\ntechnically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of\nchemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison\nto other ablation methods such as RF ablation or\ncryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the\nconnective structure [8,32]. Since it has been observed\nthat NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves,\nthere is hope of using this technique in treatment of\ntumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as\nthis treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of\nECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure\nadequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other\nminimally invasive therapies for treatment of deepseated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g.\nhigh intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation\nand radiofrequency ablation. The latter is a minimally\ninvasive procedure where a needle electrode is inserted\npercutaneously into a tumor, much as in ECT or NTIRE.\nThe electrode acts as an antenna for electromagnetic\nwaves emitted by a generator; the tumor is heated up\nand thereby destroyed [34]. As with NTIRE or ECT, the\nneed for accurate needle placement exists and its importance has been evaluated. Success,\nimproved\ntreatment, has been proven to be correlated to the experience of the operator [34].\n\ni.e.\n\nThe need for education on electroporation\nAs outlined in the paragraphs above, both reversible and\nirreversible electroporation are promising approaches in\ntreating solid tumors, however their success is highly\ndependent on local field strength. Poorly defined or unknown properties such as tissue conductivities and\n\ninhomogeneities in addition to our choice of electrode\ntype, positions and pulse amplitudes, affect the electric\nfield distribution. With many factors to take into consideration, we may dismiss important uncontrolled variables or use a well-studied but irrelevant model that\ncannot be applied to a specific situation. An example of\nthis is the persistent use of a very simple approximation\nfor electric field strength that holds only under very particular conditions. This frequently used approximation\nequates the electric field strength E to the voltage U applied on the electrodes divided by the distance d between the electrodes, i.e. E \u2248 U\/d. Since the local electric\nfield strength has been identified as the key factor in\nachieving both reversible and irreversible electroporation\n(see [19] for details), i.e. local E has to reach a certain\nthreshold value Erev or Eirrev, it is the parameter we most\noften optimize our electrode configuration for. There is\na problem, however, since this simple relation is strictly\nvalid only in an isotropic homogeneous medium between two infinitely large parallel plate electrodes. When\nusing parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this\nsimple model best approximates the actual field strength\nfar from the electrode edges, provided the electrode\nwidth is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results\nare even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of\ncourse there are no parallel plates to speak of (see\nFigure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore,\nusing the simple parallel plate approximation for E in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result\nin significant reduction of response in treatment for\nwhich the complete response rate has been shown to be\nas high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way\ninto more and more clinics worldwide [36-39] and\nestablishing themselves as safe and effective treatments\nit is becoming more and more important\nof cancer,\nthat medical personnel performing and planning ECT\n(or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action,\nthe underlying physics and possible pitfalls. This\npaper presents an application for visualization and\nanalysis of\nthe electric field strength in multipleneedle-electrode electroporation aimed at users with\nbasic knowledge of the principles of electroporation,\nbut lack of education in physics and engineering who\ninteractive and didactic\nmay therefore need visual,\ninstruments to gain a deeper understanding of\nthe\nprinciples necessary for effective use of these promising treatments. Since educational applications of the\nsort are scarce and research is focused primarily on\nadvancing the field rather than educating, the need\nto explore options and applications in this area of engineering education seems pressing and applicative\n\n\n\n---\n\nMahnic-Kalamiza et al.

We have omitted the detailed\nmathematical derivations here as they are outside the\nscope of this paper; however, we have included a derivation of the equations below in the Appendix for those\nreaders that may be interested in further development\nor modifications to our model. Below, we specify only\nthe final formulation of the mathematical model and\nthe method of application of this analytical solution\ninto the field-calculating engine that represents the\ncore of Application for Visualization of Target Tissue\n\nin Electroporation (ApiVizTEP), since this is the only\nessential part of the application around which the user\ninterface is built. Similarly to the approach that we\nin this paper, other analytical models have\npresent\nbeen developed previously using complex analysis. For\na six-needle array, one may find a first-order analytical\napproximation for the electric field strength in [42].\nOther authors have expanded on this approach further,\nsee e.g. [43] and [44]; however, these solutions do not\ngive an accurate analytical expression for the electric\nfield strength since quite possibly such a solution cannot be obtained for three or more electrodes active\nconcurrently at a given time. Since currently electroporation devices mostly power only one pair of electrodes at a time [45], we have not pursued a solution\nwith more than two concurrently active electrodes, thus\navoiding the derivation of an approximate solution. Instead, we give an accurate solution for a two needle electrode system that\nis not based (mathematically) on\npreviously published work.\nThe accurate analytical\n\nsolution for electric field\nstrength of two long parallel cylindrical conductors (needle electrodes) on a plane perpendicular to the conductor longitudinal axis (2-D solution), is given by the\nfollowing equation\n\n\n\n---\n\nMahnic-Kalamiza et al.

Originating from a prominent Midwestern university known for engineering, it investigates the flow of a specific fluoropolymer melt through an extensional geometry used in film production, focusing on the stress history analysis via computation and optical methods. This work aimed to link processing conditions to final material structure, a theme explored further in its companion paper.\n\nA key contributor to this study later became a distinguished professor and department head at a university in the Southeastern US, known for his extensive work on complex fluid dynamics. His research portfolio includes detailed simulations leveraging various bead-spring and bead-rod models, deciphering polymer effects in turbulent flows, understanding fluid permeation through fibrous materials relevant to composite manufacturing (collaborating with experts in that field), and examining instabilities at the interface of flowing polymer layers.\n\nIdentify the precise title of this initial paper analyzing the melt's journey through the specific flow setup."},"answer":"Processing\u2013property Interactions in Poly(vinylidene Fluoride).

However, these networks can easily be modified to predict continuous properties from images, like age, size, or price.\nQ: What is the Bayesian approach to neural networks?\nA: The application of the Bayesian learning paradigm to neural networks results in a flexi- ble and powerful nonlinear modelling framework that can be used for regression, den- sity estimation, prediction and classification. Within this framework, all sources of uncertainty are expressed and measured by probabilities.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_614cc5605a234e12bff2bbc6\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"1994 1995 Belgium Li\\\\u00e8ge neural network asymmetric continuous state\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": \\\"10\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: A practically feasible transfer learning method for deep-temporal ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/01431161.2023.2243021\nWe demonstrate our method with combined Sentinel 1 and 2 observations for the area of Li\u00e8ge (Belgium) for the time period spanning 2017\u20132020.\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Posterior Cingulate, Precuneal & Retrosplenial Cortices - NIH\nURL: https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC2679949\/\nA critical node in this network is the retrosplenial, posterior cingulate, and precuneal cortices (RSC\/PCC\/PrCC).\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Pain and non-pain processing during hypnosis: A thulium-YAG ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1053811909005229\nThe aim of this study was to investigate how the hypnotic state changes non-painful and painful laser-induced brain activation as compared to normal wakefulness ...\n\n---\n\nResult 3: Leonard, Naomi Ehrich - ORBi: Detailed Reference\nURL: https:\/\/orbi.uliege.be\/handle\/2268\/320280\nThis article reviews theoretical principles, analytical results, related literature, and applications of decentralized nonlinear opinion dynamics that enable ...\n\n---\n\nResult 4: Switchable slow cellular conductances determine robustness and ...\nURL: https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/ploscompbiol\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1006125\nWe investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean- ...\n\n---\n\nResult 5: Unifying turbulent dynamics framework distinguishes different brain ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/355352678_Unifying_turbulent_dynamics_framework_distinguishes_different_brain_states\nThis research has demonstrated that unconscious dynamics tend to be more synchronous than those found in conscious states, which are more ...\n\n---\n\nResult 6: [PDF] An Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning - Now Publishers\nURL: https:\/\/www.nowpublishers.com\/article\/DownloadSummary\/MAL-071\n\u201cContributions to deep reinforcement learning and its applications in smartgrids\u201d.

Together with a colleague specializing in neural networks from the same institution, they shifted focus to densely connected systems of continuous-state units. Their investigation explored the intricate 'movements' and potential for unpredictable, non-repeating patterns arising when these units, linked by Hebbian principles, possess activation responses that deviate significantly from the standard smoothed threshold curve.

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

{"example_id":19,"prompt":[{"content":"Published in a prominent international heritage journal around 2012, this Norwegian study examines the gap between official criteria and community-driven motivations for preserving cultural sites, particularly those not deemed nationally significant, including structures once central to rural education.

The junction version, known as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), was invented by Shockley in 1948.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_3c6fd4a7c9eb4611be191b42\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"pages 213-215\\\\\\\" 1987 bipolar heterojunction French research lab digital building block\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"pages 213-215\" 1987 bipolar heterojunction French research lab digital building block","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_79b0b6b253984640944a4567\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"1987 pages 213-215 conference paper bipolar transistor digital building block\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": \\\"10\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] POWER ELECTRONICS BUILDING BLOCKS AND SYSTEM ... - DTIC\nURL: https:\/\/apps.dtic.mil\/sti\/pdfs\/ADA383868.pdf\nswitching and fault protection characteristics in insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power electronics building blocks (PEBBs).

Such devices present a planar surface topology which should allow large scale integration.\nThe initial growth of the new HBT structure and the selective regrowth of the collector contact are performed by chemical beam\nepitaxy (CBE). In the case of the high C base doping level, the high temperature regrowth process induces some degradation of the\nHBT current gain which is analysed in terms of a decrease in minority carrier lifetime. Despite this effect, promising microwave\nperformances are obtained with a cut-off frequency and maximum oscillation frequency of 30 and 25 GHz, respectively.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nChemical beam epitaxy (CBE) is now recognized as a powerful growth technique for the\nrealization of GaAs based heterojunction bipolar\ntransistor (HBT) devices, mainly because of its\ncapability to produce extremely high and stable\np-type C-doping concentrations in GaAs, using\ntrimethylgallium (TMG) precursor 1.\nIn addition, CBE is also the optimum growth technique\nfor achieving selective area growth, which enables\na three-dimensional control of epitaxial\nlayers.\nThese additional capabilities expand the flexibility of device and circuit design, and are of great\ninterest for the simplification of the post-growth\nprocessing of epitaxial device structures and also\nthe monolithic integration of Ill\u2014V (opto)electronic components using selective growth processes.\n\nIn the conventional HBT technology, the wafer\nsurface is etched back every time a new layer is\naccessed in the\nstructure. Consetransistor\nquently, device contacts are present at different\ndepths from the surface down to typically 1 ~.tm.\nThe maximum step required for the collector\ncontact is mainly determined by the thickness of\n\nthe collector layer, which is optimized according\nto device specifications, such as base\u2014collector\ncapacitance and breakdown voltage. This results\nin a non-planar device structure which is a limitation for the formation of reliable metal interconnections and also for large scale integration.\n\nthis technological approach is\n\nIn the present study, we have investigated a\nnew HBT epitaxial process entirely based on CBE\nof GaAs and related materials, in order to obtain\nquasi-planar HBTs. The final surface step height\nis reduced to less than 0.3 ~xm by a selective\nregrowth of the collector contact on the subcollector layer, the base and emitter surfaces being\ncovered by a dielectric mask. A direct advantage\nthe improveof\nment of the collector contact, since a GaInAs\ncontact\nlayer can now be grown on top of the\nregrown subcollector. Such a contact provides a\nlow Schottky barrier, which is found to be effective in obtaining very low resistivity ohmic contacts without alloying,\nin a way similar to that\nwhich has already been realized for the emitter\ncontact 21. A similar solution has already been\nreported for the improvement of the base contact\nby a selective CBE regrowth of a heavily C-doped\nextrinsic base layer 3.

This leads to a simplification and\nto a higher reliability of the contacting of the\nresulting integrated circuits.\n\nThe CBE selective growth conditions for this\napplication have been studied recently 4. The\npresent paper is focused on the HBT current gain\ndegradation observed after the thermal treatment\nrequired for the selective regrowth. This thermal\ndegradation is analysed in terms of the minority\ncarrier lifetime in the C-doped GaAs base layer,\nmeasured by photoluminescence decay, and has\nbeen investigated versus C-doping level growth\nconditions and annealing temperature in order to\nreduce such degradation.\n\nWe also report the successful validation of this\ntechnological approach by the measurement of\npromising microwave performances of a quasiplanar C-base-doped HBT device produced with\na selectively regrown collector contact.\n\n2.

The regrowth regions are previously defined by opening windows in a 1000 A\nthick Si\n\n3N4 mask deposited on the whole wafer\nby plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition\n(PECVD). Then a vertical SiCI4 reactive ion\netching of the HBT structure through the mask\nwindows is achieved from the emitter cap down\nto the subcollector layer. Si3N4 vertical spacers,\ndeposited by PECVD and etched by reactive ion\netching (RIE), ensure the lateral\nisolation between the regrown collector contact and the other\nHBT active layers. A specific surface preparation,\nconsisting of a 100 A deep chemical etching followed by UV assisted ozone treatment, and a few\nminutes of silicon predeposition prior to the regrowth, are applied in order to minimize the\nresidual carbon surface contamination and to ensure the nttype continuity at the regrowth interface 4.\n\nThe CBE selective regrowth of GaAs and\nGaInAs is performed at substrate temperatures\nof 650 and 550\u00b0C,respectively. A high 2.5 gm\/h\nGaAs growth rate is used in order to minimize\nthe time of the thermal treatment corresponding\nto the regrowth. With such growth conditions, a\nperfect growth selectivity is obtained with absolutely no deposition on the dielectric mask, and\nthe layer exhibits a high thickness uniformity. A\nslight growth rate enhancement (only a few percent of the selective regrowth thickness) is observed only in the vicinity of mask edges, due to\nthe migration of species from the slow growing\n(111) sidewall planes. Furthermore, we have obtamed recently, after optimization of the selective\nGaAs growth conditions, vertical sidewalls without lateral overgrowth 10. These two features,\nwhich are specific to the CBE technique, are\nrequired for the easy removal of the mask and for\nthe realization of a planar surface.\n\nThe final\n\ntechnological steps are the device\nisolation by ion implantation,\nthe emitter and\ncollector contacting by a 3000 A thick tungsten\nfilm, and the C-doped base contacting by Mn\u2014\nAu\u2014Ti\u2014Au ohmic contact\nthrough the GaInP\nlayer, after the GaA1As emitter mesa has been\nformed by selective etching.\n\nAll these different technological steps are realized on 2 inch wafers. For the two CBE growth\n\nthe wafer is mounted indium-free and\nsteps,\nheated radiatively through a boron nitride diffus-\n\ning plate. The growth temperature is monitored\nby an optical pyrometer working at a wavelength\nof 0.94 ~m.\n\n3. Static quasi-planar HBT characterization\n\nTransmission line measurements (TLMs) were\nused to extract the electrical parameters of the\ncollector contact regrowth. A resistivity contact as\n2 has been obtained for a 1 fi\nlow as 10\u20146 11 cm\ncontact resistance.\n\nStatic performances have been obtained on\nHBTs with a 2 X 15 ~m2 emitter\u2014base junction\narea and a 6 x 15 j.tm2 collector\u2014base junction\narea. A common emitter current gain (f3) of 2.5\nfor a base sheet resistance of 140 fl\/U was\nmeasured, with a breakdown voltage of the collector\u2014base junction BVCEO above 15 V. This \/3\nlow, as compared to the value of 23\nvalue is\nmeasured on a similar HBT structure processed\nwith a low temperature conventional double-mesa\ntechnology, although the base sheet resistance is\nconstant within 10.\n\nThis degradation of current gain after the\nthermal treatment required for the regrowth process cannot be attributed to a base dopant diffusion towards the emitter layer, as shown by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). More precisely,\nthe same low value of 1.21 V for the\nemitter\u2014base threshold voltage is measured for\nboth the low temperature conventional HBT\ntechnology and the high temperature technology\nwith the regrowth process. This threshold voltage,\ndefined as the emitter\u2014base voltage required to\ngenerate a fixed value of the collector current,\nhas been found to be extremely sensitive to base\ndopant diffusion, and the low measured value\nagrees well with a simulation without dopant\ndiffusion 6. This behaviour is in accordance with\nthe high thermal stability of C dopant in GaAs.\n\nIn order to determine the origins of the device\nperformance degradation, we have performed\nsome measurements by time-resolved photoluminescence, of minority carrier lifetime in C-doped\nGaAs layers sandwiched by undoped GaAlAs lay-\n\n\n\n---\n\n238\n\nF.

This correlation follows well\nthe\ndependence of the current gain \/3 with the electron lifetime in the base layer r according to the\nrelation:\n\n\/3 ~\u2014~\n\n\/ EC\u2019\n\ngain is directly related to the reduction of minority carrier lifetime after anneal. Similar results on\nsamples grown by metalorganic chemical vapour\ndeposition have been found in our own study and\nin ref. 7.\n\nTo investigate the mechanism causing the minority carrier lifetime change with annealing, the\ncorresponding variation in concentration of both\n\nSIMS, with detection limits of I x 1017 and 4 x\ncarbon and hydrogen atoms were measured by\n3, respectively. In the case of C-doping\nlevels higher than 5 x 1019 cm3, we can detect a\n10i8 cm\nhydrogen content which amounts to more than\n\nof the C content in the as-grown layers, and\n10\nwhich decreases drastically to lower than the\nSIMS detection limit, after annealing at 650\u00b0C.\nThere has been evidence that hydrogen is incor-\n\nporated into the C-doped layer along with car-\n\n.\n\n.\n\nvia\n\nthe\n\nbon,\nincomplete decomposition of\ntrimethylgallium species 8. We think therefore\nthe reduction of electron lifetime after anthat\nneal\nis related to the exodiffusion of hydrogen\natoms. We speculate that the unstable behaviour\nof the highly C doped layers must be due to deep\nlevels already present in the as-grown material.\nSuch defects might be hydrogen passivated in the\nas-grown layer and are then revealed when the\n\nhydrogen is removed during high temperature\nthermal treatment 9.\n\nFrom the present data,\n\nit appears that a reduced thermal degradation of the minority carrier properties, compatible with a sufficient HBT\ncurrent gain, can be obtained in the case of C\n3 and\ndoping concentrations of up to 2 x 10i9 cm\nfor selective regrowth temperature lower than\n650\u00b0C.This critical temperature can be decreased\ndown to 550\u00b0C by using a reduced 0.8 gm\/h\nselective growth rate when growing with the use\nand\nof a triethylgallium (TEG) precursor 10,\ndown to 450\u00b0Cin the case of a TMG source 11.\nIn this way,\nthe thermal degradation of HBT\ncurrent gain has been reduced to a factor of 2\n12. Moreover, we have recently succeeded in\n\nobtaining quite stable minority carrier properties\nof heavily C-doped GaAs layers up to 2 x 1020\n\nwhere TEC is the transit\ntime of electrons from\nthe emitter to the collector.

This neighboring settlement, also originating in that historical period, was another territory controlled by this extensive empire, which was distinguished by its management of vital watercourses and its far-reaching trade networks before its power waned, enabling one of its own military commanders to rise to prominence. This commander, having previously served the declining empire, successfully broke away to institute his own dynastic sovereignty.

In January 1817, Austen began work on a new novel she called\n\n*The Brothers*, later titled\n\n*Sanditon*, and completed twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably because of illness.\n\n[1]R.W. Chapman first published a transcription of the original manuscript in 1925 under the name\n\n*Fragment of a Novel Written by Jane Austen, January\u2013March 1817*.\n\n[2]\n\n## Synopsis\n\n[edit]The novel centres on Charlotte Heywood, the eldest of the daughters still at home in the large family of a country gentleman from Willingden, Sussex. The narrative opens when the carriage of Mr and Mrs Parker of Sanditon topples over on a hill near the Heywood home. Because Mr Parker is injured in the crash, and the carriage needs repairs, the Parkers stay with the Heywood family for a fortnight. During this time, Mr Parker talks fondly of Sanditon, a town which until a few years before had been a small, unpretentious fishing village. With his business partner, Lady Denham, Mr Parker hopes to make Sanditon into a fashionable seaside resort. Mr Parker's enormous enthusiasm for his plans to improve and modernise Sanditon has resulted in the installation of bathing machines and the construction of a new home for himself and his family near the seashore. Upon repair of the carriage and improvement to Mr Parker's foot, the Parkers return to Sanditon, bringing Charlotte with them as their summer guest.\n\nUpon arrival in Sanditon, Charlotte meets the inhabitants of the town. Prominent among them is Lady Denham, a twice-widowed woman who received a fortune from her first husband and a title from her second. Living with Lady Denham is her niece Clara Brereton, a sweet and beautiful yet impoverished young lady. Also living in Sanditon are Sir Edward Denham and his sister Esther, nephew and niece to Lady Denham by her second husband. The siblings are poor and are thought to be seeking Lady Denham's fortune; Sir Edward is described as a silly and very florid man, though handsome.\n\nAfter settling in with the Parkers and encountering various neighbours, Charlotte and Mr and Mrs Parker are surprised by a visit from his two sisters and younger brother, all of whom are self-declared invalids. However, given their level of activity and seeming strength, Charlotte quickly surmises that their complaints are invented. Diana Parker has come on a mission to secure a house for a wealthy family from the West Indies, although she has not specifically been asked to help. She also brings word of a second large party, a girls' school, which is intending to summer at Sanditon. This news causes a stir in the small town, especially for Mr Parker, whose fondest wish is the promotion of tourism there.\n\nWith the arrival of Mrs Griffiths at Sanditon, it soon becomes apparent that the family from the West Indies and the girls' school group are one and the same. The visitors consist of Miss Lambe, a teenaged Antiguan-English heiress, and the two Miss Beauforts, English girls just arrived from the West Indies.[3] In short order, Lady Denham calls on Mrs. Griffiths to be introduced to Miss Lambe, the sickly and very rich young woman that she intends her nephew, Sir Edward, to marry.\n\nA carriage unexpectedly arrives bearing Sidney Parker, the middle Parker brother. He will be staying in town for a few days with two friends who will join him shortly. Sidney Parker is about 27 or 28 years old, and Charlotte finds him very good-looking, with a decided air of fashion.\n\nThe book fragment ends when Mrs Parker and Charlotte visit Sanditon House, Lady Denham's residence. There Charlotte spots Clara Brereton seated with Sir Edward Denham at her side having an intimate conversation in the garden and surmises that they must have a secret understanding. When they arrive inside, Charlotte observes that a large portrait of Sir Henry Denham hangs over the fireplace, whereas Lady Denham's first husband, who owned Sanditon House, only gets a miniature in the corner \u2013 obliged, as it were, to sit back in his own house and see the best place by the fire constantly occupied by Sir Henry Denham.\n\n## Characters\n\n[edit]**Mr. and Mrs. Heywood**\u2013 A prosperous gentleman farmer and his wife who open their home to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Parker, whose carriage overturns nearby. It was written that the Heywoods would have been even more prosperous if they had not had 14 children. They do not care to travel, but have no objection to their children doing so if they have the opportunity.**Charlotte Heywood**\u2013 The eldest of the Heywood daughters still at home. A nice, pretty girl who appears to be the heroine of the novel. Much of the story is told from her perspective. She is invited to experience the seaside at Sanditon with Mr. and Mrs. Parker.**Mr. Thomas Parker**\u2013 The eldest of the three Parker brothers. Middle-aged; fanatical over the health benefits of sea air and water. He and Lady Denham are invested in promoting Sanditon as a smaller Brighton.**Mrs. Thomas Parker****(Mary)**\u2013 Thomas' wife and mother of their four children,**Little Mary**and three boys.**Sidney Parker**\u2013 The second Parker brother, who is 27\u201328 years old. Good-looking, well bred, \"air of ease and fashion and a lively countenance\". Most sources contend he was to be the hero and marry Charlotte; however, he is barely mentioned before Austen stopped writing and it is not known what other characters she might have had in mind. He and his three other siblings, Arthur, Susan, and Diana come to Sanditon for a visit.**Miss Susan Parker**\u2013 The older of the two spinster Parker sisters. A hypochondriac.**Miss Diana Parker**\u2013 34 years old. A hypochondriac when not busy being a nosy, self-satisfied, officious pest.**Arthur Parker**\u2013 The youngest Parker brother. 21 years old. An overweight hypochondriac. \"Poor health\" is his excuse to eat what he wants and sit lazily by the fire. Lives with his spinster sisters.**Lady Denham, n\u00e9e Brereton**\u2013 70 years old; twice widowed. She lives in Sanditon Hall, the largest house in the area and home of her first husband. She was born wealthy but was not well educated. She inherited more money from her first husband,**Mr. Hollis**. Her title came from her poor, second husband**Sir Harry Denham**. Many family members, her own and her late husbands', wish to inherit from her.**Sir Edward Denham**\u2013 He inherits Sir Harry's title but not the money. He is insincere, with loose morals. He would like to seduce Clara Brereton because she is \"young, lovely, and dependent\" and a rival for Lady Denham's fortune.**Miss Esther Denham**\u2013 The sister of Sir Edward.**Miss Clara Brereton**\u2013 The poor distant cousin of Lady Denham who has been living with her for about a year. She is a \"lovely and interesting young woman... Elegantly tall, regularly handsome, with great delicacy of complexion and soft blue eyes, (with) a sweetly modest and yet naturally graceful address.\"**Mrs. Whitby**\u2013 She runs the library\/general store in Sanditon.**Miss Whitby**\u2013 Helps with her mother's business.**Young Whitby**\u2013 Helps with his mother's business.**Mr. and Mrs. Hillier**\u2013 Mentioned as people now living in the Parker's previous family home since Mr. Thomas Parker built a modern new home named \"Trafalgar\".**Mrs. Griffiths**\u2013 Seems to be a professional chaperone who is paid to look after girls and introduce them around.**Miss Beaufort**\u2013 One of Mrs. Griffiths' charges, who plays the harp. Interested in fashion, and looking for a rich husband.**Miss Letitia Beaufort**\u2013 Younger sister to Miss Beaufort. She sketches. Also interested in fashion and looking for a rich husband.**Miss Lambe**\u2013 One of Mrs. Griffiths' charges. A 17-year-old \"half-mulatto\" heiress from the West Indies in poor health. Lady Denham is interested in her as a potential bride for her impecunious nephew Sir Edward.\n\n## Analysis and background\n\n[edit]The people of \"modern Sanditon\", as Austen calls it, have moved out of the \"old house \u2013 the house of [their] forefathers\" and are busily constructing a new world in the form of a modern seaside commercial town. The town of Sanditon is almost certainly based on Worthing, where Jane Austen stayed in late 1805 when the resort was first being developed. There is persuasive evidence that the character of Mr. Thomas Parker was inspired by Edward Ogle, Worthing's early entrepreneur, whom Jane Austen and her sister Cassandra knew.[4][5][6][7] Sanditon is, however, less of an actual reality than an ideal of the inhabitants \u2013 one that they express in their descriptions of it. These inhabitants have a conception of the town's identity and of the way in which this identity should be spread to, and appreciated by, the world:\n\nMy name perhaps... may be unknown at this distance from the coast \u2013 but Sanditon itself \u2013 everybody has heard of Sanditon, \u2013 the favourite \u2013 for a young and rising bathing-place, certainly the favourite spot of all that are to be found along the coast of Sussex; \u2013 the most favoured by nature, and promising to be the most chosen by man.\n\n\n\u2014 *Sanditon*\n\n## Continuations and adaptations\n\n[edit]Because Austen completed setting the scene for Sanditon, it has been a favourite of \"continuators\" \u2013 later writers who try to complete the novel within Austen's vision while emulating her style. Such \"completed\" versions of Sanditon include:\n\n*Sanditon*, by Jane Austen and \"another lady\", ISBN 0-684-84342-0; also published as*Sanditon*, by Jane Austen and Marie Dobbs, ISBN 3-423-12666-3 and*Sanditon*, by Jane Austen and Anne Telscombe, ISBN 0-395-20284-1[8]*A Completion of Sanditon*, by Juliette Shapiro, ISBN 1-58939-503-4 (does not include Austen's text)*A Return to Sanditon: a completion of Jane Austen's fragment*, by Anne Toledo, ISBN 978-1-4580-7426-3 (includes Austen's text)*Sanditon*, by Jane Austen and completed by D.

These assessments provide insights into how cognitive impairments impact the individual's ability to perform everyday tasks.\nQ: What is a visuospatial deficit after a stroke?\nA: Visuospatial neglect (VSN) is a common cognitive disorder after stroke. Patients with VSN have problems reporting and responding or orienting to visual stimuli in the contralesional hemispace that cannot be attributed to sensory or motor impairments [1].","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_03eb401c610e4a3580fd850a\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\": [\\\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/18446089\/\\\", \\\"https:\/\/medicaljournalssweden.se\/jrm\/article\/view\/41195\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/18446089\/\n# Assessment of visuospatial neglect in stroke patients using virtual reality: a pilot study\n\n-\nPMID:\n**18446089** - DOI: 10.1097\/MRR.0b013e3283013b1c\n\n# Assessment of visuospatial neglect in stroke patients using virtual reality: a pilot study\n\n## Abstract\n\nOne of the neuropsychological deficits that can result from a stroke is the neglect phenomenon. Neglect has traditionally been assessed with paper-and-pencil tasks, which are administered within the reaching space of a person. The purpose of this explorative study is to investigate whether it is possible to assess neglect in the extrapersonal space based on the performance of acute stroke patients, chronic stroke patients and healthy elderly in orientation and exploration tasks when immersed in a three-dimensional (3D)-virtual environment. Six able-bodied healthy elderly and 12 stroke patients (six subacute and six chronic) participated in this explorative cross-sectional study. Neglect was assessed by means of the 3D neglect test. Different parameters were measured at two challenge levels with increasing difficulty. In the easiest level significant differences between the groups were found for total time spent in the test, mean response time left field of vision, and mean response time in the left field of vision of the left virtual reality environment. Differences in search patterns showed that subacute stroke patients had a much more fuzzy search pattern in scanning the environment than healthy elderly and chronic stroke patients. With respect to the more difficult level results showed significant differences between healthy elderly and the total group of stroke patients. The results of this study suggest that a 3D neglect test by means of virtual reality has the potential to detect and measure unilateral neglect.\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Full Text Sources\n\n### Medical\n\n# Content from https:\/\/medicaljournalssweden.se\/jrm\/article\/view\/41195\n# Immersive virtual reality to assess unilateral spatial neglect in stroke patients: a preliminary study\n\n## DOI:\n\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.2340\/jrm.v57.41195## Keywords:\n\nNeglect, stroke, cancellation test, virtual reality## Abstract\n\n**Objectives**: The conventional test to detect unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is the Bells Test performed in a paper-and-pencil format. While several studies showed immersive virtual reality (VR) tests may provide greater sensitivity in revealing the presence of USN using visual scanning tasks, none has investigated the Bells Test in VR. This study compares the Bells Test performed in paper-and-pencil format (PP) and in VR in conventional (CVR) and ecological (EVR) format, which differ by the size of the display, in stroke patients.\n\n**Design**: Cross-sectional study.\n\n**Setting**: Stroke patients.\n\n**Participants**: A convenience sample of 32 stroke patients.\n\n**Interventions**: VR assessments were performed using an immersive system with a head-mounted display. In CVR, the Bells Test is reproduced in the same format as PP (A4 sheet), while in EVR, the targets are displayed in a wider space corresponding to a hemisphere of 1-m radius.\n\n**Results**: The number of cancelled targets out of 35 was 32.5 (3.5) for PP, 33 (4) for CVR, and 34 (2) for EVR (mean [SD]), with a significant difference between PP and EVR (p < 0.05). The time to complete the Bells Test was 186 (69) s for PP, 184 (65) s for CVR, and 170 (58) s for EVR, without differences between modalities (p > 0.05). Bells Tests in the 3 modalities revealed the presence of USN, except for 1 patient in EVR.\n\n**Conclusion**: VR assessment of USN could be used in the same way as conventional cancellations tests. Moreover, VR could provide additional information on the type of USN through the different testing modalities available.\n\n### Downloads\n\n## References\n\nHeilman KM, Valenstein E.

These summit-based energy installations are photovoltaic systems that often channel surplus electricity into the broader power grid. A critical electronic device in these grid-integrated setups is responsible for converting the panel's direct current output into alternating current. On a much larger scale, similar current conversion technology is employed in systems designed for bulk power transmission over extensive distances using direct current at very high potentials. Such long-distance systems, which operate with this non-alternating current to reduce energy loss, may, in certain configurations (especially those with a single main conductor), use a specific type of conductor to link to an earth grounding point.

A monopolar.\n\n---\n\nPeople Also Ask:\nQ: What is the voltage range of HVDC?\nA: HVDC overhead lines can be used up to 800kV and are capable of transporting more than 6GW on a single bipole route. However, transfers of this level have only been undertaken using CSC technology. As yet, VSC technology has not been proposed to power capabilities beyond 1\u20132GW.\nQ: What is the ground electrode of HVDC?\nA: A ground electrode is typically a large metal ring about 300 - 800 metres in diameter buried approximately three metres in the ground and surrounded by a highly conductive bed of coke. The electrode provides grounding of the HVdc system to the earth when slight imbalances of current occur between the bipole lines.\nQ: What is monopole and bipole in HVDC?\nA: A scheme patented in 2004 is intended for conversion of existing AC transmission lines to HVDC. Two of the three circuit conductors are operated as a bipole. The third conductor is used as a parallel monopole, equipped with reversing valves (or parallel valves connected in reverse polarity).","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_2a7aeb65fcfa4b0cb19b87c4\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\": [\\\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electrode_line\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electrode_line\n# Electrode line\n\nAn **electrode line** is used in some high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) power transmission systems, to connect the converter stations to distant ground electrodes. Many long-distance HVDC systems use sea or ground return for the DC neutral current since this is considerably cheaper than providing a dedicated *metallic return* conductor on an overhead wire or cable. The ground electrode is separated from the converter station so that current returning through the ground electrode does not cause corrosion of parts of the station in contact with the earth.\n\n## Ground connection\n\n[edit]The connection to ground requires a specially designed *ground electrode* (or *earth electrode*).[1][2] The electrode is usually located several tens of kilometres from the converter station in order to avoid possible problems or corrosion in the converter station grounding system. [3] The **electrode line** connects the converter station to the grounding electrode. The electrode line can be implemented, depending upon the location of the electrode (onshore or in the sea), as ground cables, as overhead line, or as a combination of ground cable and overhead line.\n\n## Bipolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are used in most bipolar thyristor-based line-commutated converter (LCC) HVDC transmission systems as a means to improve the reliability of the entire system while also reducing the DC voltage and current ripples. In the event that one of the poles in the bipolar system is faulted, the current path will switch to ground return, thus allowing the system to continue operating at reduced capacity and reducing the possibility that a pole fault will cause a bipolar outage. Usually these ground return paths are only used for very short durations until the faulted pole can be returned to service. The ground current in such schemes can flow in either direction, so the electrodes have to be designed to be reversible, operating either as an anode or cathode. Concerning voltage-source-converter (VSC) HVDC systems, the main reason to use bipolar configurations, especially when the pole-to-pole DC voltages approach 1 MV, is because when one line is faulted in a monopolar HVDC system, the AC phase-to-ground voltages experience peak voltages twice that of normal operation, calling for double the galvanic isolation that is need for normal operation.\n\n## Monopolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are also used in some monopolar HVDC systems, for example the Italy\u2013Corsica\u2013Sardinia scheme.[4] In such systems the electrode line permanently carries the same current as the high-voltage conductor; however since the ground current is then only unidirectional, one of the electrodes (the cathode) can be of simpler design since corrosion is not a problem for cathode electrodes.\n\n## Typical voltages\n\n[edit]The operating voltage of the electrode line usually is in the range of approx. 10-20kV (medium voltage range).[5]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**Arrillaga, Jos; High Voltage Direct Current Transmission, second edition, Institution of Electrical Engineers, ISBN 0 85296 941 4, 1998, pp190\u2013192.**^**Kimbark, E.W., Direct current transmission, volume 1, Wiley Interscience, 1971, chapter 9.**^**M.V.Bakshi U.A.Bakshi,*Elements Of Power Systems*, Technical Publications, 2009, ISBN 8184312679 page 12-26**^**Compendium of HVDC schemes, CIGR\u00c9 Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987.**^**Padiyar, K.

This application report focuses\non the control and protection requirements of HVDC station, products and solutions that can be leveraged during\ncontrol and protection system design.\n\n1.1 Electrical Power - Generation, Transmission and Distribution\n\nElectricity is produced by large power plants and is then carried over long distances (> 100 km) at high voltages\n(110 kV or more) by the transmission lines, which is stepped down to the level of the distribution network (11 kV\nor 415 V), bringing electric power to the consumer. Most power plants generate electricity as AC and the entire\nsystem uses AC afterwards since the voltage can be stepped up or down easily by the use of transformers.\nBulk power from the generation plant is transported to consumers using transmission lines operating at high\nvoltages. For shorter distance transmission of power (< 100 km), AC transmissions are widely preferred. When\nthe transmission distances are longer (> 500 km), limitations are seen in using AC transmission.\n\n1.2 HVAC to HVDC Power Transmission\n\nThe electrical supply demand is increasing globally. Power plants are often located near to energy sources, to\nminimize costs and environmental effects. These power plants often are located away from heavily populated\nareas or cities, therefore, transporting the electricity generated economically and efficiently is important. This\nis accomplished by transmitting the generated power at a high voltage. High-voltage (HVAC) is preferred\nfor transmission purposes mainly because higher voltages are easily achievable by means of a transformer\n(stepping up at the power plant and stepping down at the substation).\n\nTo meet the growing demand, utilities are looking at improving the system performance by interconnecting the\ngrid to balance the load and looking at using newer technologies (HVDC or Flexible AC Transmission Systems\nFACTS) for improving efficiency. The advantages of HVAC is simpler voltage transformation and easier current\ninterruption. In some cases, it is not possible to use HVAC transmission technology, when long transmission\nlines (> 500 km) are involved due to voltage instability and higher transmission losses. The disadvantage of\nHVAC is limitations on long distance transmission, current carrying capacity, reactive power (need reactive\npower compensation at different locations along the transmission lines) loss, skin effect (non-uniform current\ndistribution in conductors carrying, where most of the current is found in the conductor\u2019s outer layers increasing\neffective resistance) and the Ferranti (received voltage higher than the transmitted voltage) effect. Using HVDC\nfor transmitting power over long distances is the solution.\n\n1.2.1 Comparison of HVDC and HVAC\n\nTable 1-1 provides a comparison between DC and AC for critical parameters that influence the decision for\nsetting up new HVDC station.\n\nParameters\n\nType of transmission\n\nApplication\n\nTable 1-1.

The primary objective of using HVDC transmission is summarized below:\n\n\u2022 Bulk power transmission: Transmit bulk power from one point to another point over long distances (> 500 km\n\nfor overhead lines).\n\n\u2022 Connect asynchronous systems: allows transfer of power between grid systems running at different\n\nfrequencies is improving stability and economy of each grid.\n\n\u2022 Off-shore wind farm integration: simplifies bulk power transfer from off-shore wind farms to large load\n\nconsumption centers.\n\n\u2022 Back-to-back HVDC system: rectification and inversion takes place at the same station with very small DC\n\nline\n\n1.3 Working Principle of HVDC Transmission Station\n\nIn the HVDC station, the converter transformer steps-up the generated AC voltages to the required level. The\nconverter station takes the electric power from the three-phase AC network and rectifies it to DC, which is then\ntransmitted through overhead lines (or cables). At the receiving end of the converter station, an inverter converts\nthe DC voltage back to AC, which is stepped down to the distribution voltage levels at various consumer ends.\nFigure 1-1 illustrates the power transmission process. This technology is suitable for transmitting rated power\nrange between 100-10,000MW.\n\nFigure 1-1.

HVDC Transmission Station Overview\n\n2.1 HVDC Transmission Technologies\n\nTo utilize DC, a conversion step is necessary. In order to convert high voltage AC power to DC power, two\ntechnologies are available, classical Line Commutated Converter (LCC) and the Voltage Source Converter\n(VSC). LCC is commonly called as HVDC Classic, while VSC has a several names, like HVDC Light (ABB),\nHVDC Plus (Siemens), HVDC MaxSine (Alstom) and Flexible HVDC (China).\n\nLCC converter technology is based on a semiconductor-based switch named thyristor. Thyristors need to be\nturned on, or fired, to start conducting current. These switches can withstand the AC voltage in either polarity but\ncurrent can only flow in one direction and can be limited by adjusting the time the thyristors are turned on. This\ntime, or angle in a sinusoid, at which the thyristors are turned on is called the firing angle, or valve ignition delay\nangle, and is used to control power flow between the HVDC stations.\n\nVoltage Source Converter technology is based on Insular Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT). The IGBT can be\ncontrolled both with regards to being turned on or off. In VSC technology, the DC current can flow in both\ndirections. That is a benefit over the LCC technology in which the current can flow in one direction. Considering\nthe bi-directional capability of the DC current flow in VSC, there is no need to change the DC voltage polarity\nof the converters to change the power flow direction between converters. Compared to LCC technology, it is\npossible for VSC to be connected to weak grids that has low short-circuited level.\n\nIn VSC based HVDC, Power can be controlled by changing the phase angle of the converter AC voltage with\nrespect to the filter bus voltage, whereas the reactive power can be controlled by changing the magnitude of the\nfundamental component of the converter AC voltage with respect to the filter bus voltage. By controlling these\ntwo aspects of the converter voltage, operation in all four quadrants is possible.\n\nSLOA289B \u2013 MAY 2020 \u2013 REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021\nSubmit Document Feedback\n\nIntroduction to HVDC Architecture and Solutions for Control and Protection\n\n5\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\n\n\n---\n\nHVDC Transmission System (HVDC station)\n\nwww.ti.com\n\n2.2 HVDC Transmission System (HVDC station) Key Components\n\nFigure 2-2.

Each HVDC system\nhas two converters one at each end. The converter at transmitting end act as a rectifier and the converter at\nthe receiving end act as an inverter. Based on the HVDC technology the converter can be based on IGBT or\nThyristor switching elements.\n\nThe converters typically constitute of one or more IGBT\/thyristor bridges where each bridge consists of six\nIGBT\/thyristor valve arms, which is based on the system\u2019s voltage and power rating contain numerous individual\nIGBT\/thyristors. For achieving higher voltages and currents, switching devices (IGBT or thyristors) are connected\nin parallel and series. For higher voltages, switching devices are connected in Series and for higher currents\nswitching devices are connected in Parallel. Commonly used HVDC configurations include monopolar and\nbipolar links and the number of converters in a HVDC station depends on the configuration.\n\n2.2.2 Converter Valve Arms\n\nValves have modular design and consists of modern light triggered thyristors as today\u2019s 500 kV thyristor valves.\nIndividual thyristor modules will be arranged in valve towers. Double valve tower or quadruple valve tower are\npossible solutions depending on the valve hall and transformer arrangement. For UHVDC application double\nvalve towers seem to be more adequate due to large clearance requirements inside the valve halls.\n\nThe valve arm contains a number of switching elements connected in series (or parallel). Based on LCC or\nVSC is the converter topology, the switching element could be thyristor or IGBT. The number of the switching\nelements depends on the voltage level of the HVDC station.\n\n\u2022 Thyristor LCC valves: The thyristor valves can be build-up in different ways depending on the application and\nmanufacturer. However, the most common way of arranging the thyristor valves is in a twelve-pulse group\nwith three quadruple valves. Each single thyristor valve consists of a certain amount of series connected\nthyristors with their auxiliary circuits. All communication between the control equipment and each thyristor at\nhigh potential, is done with fibre optics.\nIGBT VSC valves: The VSC converter consists of a two level or a multilevel converter, phase-reactors and\nAC filters. Each single valve in the converter bridge is built up with a certain number of series connected\nIGBTs together with their auxiliary electronics. VSC valves, control equipment and cooling equipment would\nbe in enclosures (such as standard shipping containers) that make transport and installation very easy. All\nmodern HVDC valves are water-cooled and air insulated.\n\n\u2022\n\n2.2.2.1 Converter Phase Arms\n\nThe phase arm of the converter is consists of two valve arms (upper and lower arms), which are connected to\nthe input or output of the AC supply converter transformer. Each phase has two arms. AC is transmitted along\nthe grid in three phase configuration. A three phase converter has three phase arms consisting of 6 valves.

Depending on the voltage rating, IGBT\/Thyristors are connected in series and depending on the\ncurrent rating; IGBT\/Thyristors are connected in parallel.\n\n2.2.3 Converter Transformers\n\nThe converter transformers transform the voltage of the AC busbar to the required entry voltage of the converter.\nThe transformer is an interface between AC side and DC side. The main insulation, therefore, is stressed by\nboth the AC voltage and the DC voltage potential between valve-side winding and ground. These are special\n\nSLOA289B \u2013 MAY 2020 \u2013 REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021\nSubmit Document Feedback\n\nIntroduction to HVDC Architecture and Solutions for Control and Protection\n\n7\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\n\n\n---\n\nHVDC Transmission System (HVDC station)\n\nwww.ti.com\n\ntypes of transformers that are designed to withstand high harmonics currents and voltage stress. Also, they\nwill have tap changers to enable the optimization of HVDC operations. Converter transformers act as galvanic\nbarrier between AC and DC systems to prevent DC potential entering into the AC system. Availability of the\nHVDC transmission is dependent on the converter transformer performance.\n\nIn HVDC transmission there is requirement for large voltage control at the converter & inverter ends. Converter\ntransformer typically includes an on-load tap-changer to assist with voltage regulation. Tapping range is large (25\n~ 30%) with small steps to give necessary adjustments in supply voltage. On-load tap-changers (OLTCs) are\nused for changing the transformer winding ratio to control the firing angle and to compensate voltage variations.\nOLTCs are used to control the DC output voltage when the converter is used as rectifier and AC voltage to the\ngrid when the converter is used as an inverter. The transformer tap ratio can be manipulated to help prevent\nthe converter from becoming over or under-modulated. Operating the converter in the over or under-modulated\nregion could have a negative impact on harmonic performance.\n\n2.2.4 Power Transmission Lines\n\nTransmission lines can be overhead lines and underground (or undersea) cables.

Many long-distance HVDC systems use sea or ground return for the DC neutral current since this is considerably cheaper than providing a dedicated *metallic return* conductor on an overhead wire or cable. The ground electrode is separated from the converter station so that current returning through the ground electrode does not cause corrosion of parts of the station in contact with the earth.\n\n## Ground connection\n\n[edit]The connection to ground requires a specially designed *ground electrode* (or *earth electrode*).[1][2] The electrode is usually located several tens of kilometres from the converter station in order to avoid possible problems or corrosion in the converter station grounding system. [3] The **electrode line** connects the converter station to the grounding electrode. The electrode line can be implemented, depending upon the location of the electrode (onshore or in the sea), as ground cables, as overhead line, or as a combination of ground cable and overhead line.\n\n## Bipolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are used in most bipolar thyristor-based line-commutated converter (LCC) HVDC transmission systems as a means to improve the reliability of the entire system while also reducing the DC voltage and current ripples. In the event that one of the poles in the bipolar system is faulted, the current path will switch to ground return, thus allowing the system to continue operating at reduced capacity and reducing the possibility that a pole fault will cause a bipolar outage. Usually these ground return paths are only used for very short durations until the faulted pole can be returned to service. The ground current in such schemes can flow in either direction, so the electrodes have to be designed to be reversible, operating either as an anode or cathode. Concerning voltage-source-converter (VSC) HVDC systems, the main reason to use bipolar configurations, especially when the pole-to-pole DC voltages approach 1 MV, is because when one line is faulted in a monopolar HVDC system, the AC phase-to-ground voltages experience peak voltages twice that of normal operation, calling for double the galvanic isolation that is need for normal operation.\n\n## Monopolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are also used in some monopolar HVDC systems, for example the Italy\u2013Corsica\u2013Sardinia scheme.[4] In such systems the electrode line permanently carries the same current as the high-voltage conductor; however since the ground current is then only unidirectional, one of the electrodes (the cathode) can be of simpler design since corrosion is not a problem for cathode electrodes.\n\n## Typical voltages\n\n[edit]The operating voltage of the electrode line usually is in the range of approx. 10-20kV (medium voltage range).[5]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**Arrillaga, Jos; High Voltage Direct Current Transmission, second edition, Institution of Electrical Engineers, ISBN 0 85296 941 4, 1998, pp190\u2013192.**^**Kimbark, E.W., Direct current transmission, volume 1, Wiley Interscience, 1971, chapter 9.**^**M.V.Bakshi U.A.Bakshi,*Elements Of Power Systems*, Technical Publications, 2009, ISBN 8184312679 page 12-26**^**Compendium of HVDC schemes, CIGR\u00c9 Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987.**^**Padiyar, K.

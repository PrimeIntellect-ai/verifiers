{"example_id":0,"prompt":[{"content":"Begin with a 1930s Italian film, adapted from literature and set in a warm, humid climate zone, which included a particular actor in its cast. This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city. This political figure initially entered the national legislative body following a nationwide electoral contest, which distinctively integrated, for the first time, elected officials from several newly acquired territories. Among these territories was a particular island that gained representation in that election.

Eritrea and Somalia, Italian possessions since the 1880s, were enlarged with captured Ethiopian territory and became the Eritrea and Somalia Governorates. The remainder of the occupied Ethiopian territories comprised the Harar, Galla-Sidamo, Amhara, and Scioa Governorates. At its largest extent, Italian East Africa occupied territories in British Somaliland, British Kenya, and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.[13] By 1939, it was settled by about 165,270 Italian colonists.\n\nDuring World War II, Italian East Africa became the battleground of the East African campaign (part of the Mediterranean and Middle East theater).[14] After the Battle of Gondar in November 1941, it was occupied by a British-led force including colonial units and Ethiopian resistance fighters.[15][16] All former Italian territories came under British administration;[7] occupied Ethiopia was ruled until full sovereignty was restored in 1944. In 1950, Allied occupied Somalia became the United Nations Trust Territory of Somaliland, administered by Italy from 1950 until its independence in 1960. Allied occupied Eritrea became an autonomous part of Ethiopia in 1952. It was later annexed by the Ethiopian Empire in 1962 and gained its independence in 1993 as Eritrea.[17]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Italian ambitions and rise of fascism\n\n[edit]In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Italy sought to expand its colonial empire, competing with other European powers for overseas territories. Early efforts included the colonization of Eritrea (1890) and Italian Somaliland (1905), followed by the unsuccessful invasion of the Ethiopian Empire in the First Italo-Ethiopian War (1895\u20131896).[18] After World War I, nationalist sentiments grew, fueled by the belief that Italy had been denied its rightful territorial rewards for its contribution to the war effort, a sentiment known as the Mutilated Victory (Italian: *Vittoria Mutilata*).[19][20] The combination of mobilization costs and the social unrest that followed the war is widely thought to have strengthened Italian irredentism and nationalism.[21] This frustration contributed to the rise of Benito Mussolini and his Fascist regime in 1922.[22]\n\nMussolini injected a new and aggressive impetus into these frustrations and ambitions, framing colonial expansion as a means to restore Roman greatness, enhance national prestige, and solve Italy's economic problems by providing land and resources.[23][24] Mussolini believed the Italian people lacked a strong nationalistic and colonial conscience and thus sought to cultivate these sentiments through Fascist propaganda, particularly in the lead-up to the invasion and during occupation of the Ethiopia Empire.[25] This propaganda emphasized Italy's need for colonial territories (Italian: *spazio vitale*), the perceived danger of Ethiopian aggression, and the injustice of international opposition to Italian expansion.[26] The conquest of Ethiopia in 1936 and the subsequent formation of Italian East Africa were presented as major achievements of the Fascist regime, aimed at fulfilling long-standing Italian ambitions and establishing Italy as a major power.[27][23] Despite earlier consideration of a protectorate over parts of Ethiopia, the Fascist government pursued full conquest, driven by Mussolini's determination to achieve a significant colonial victory to bolster his regime's legitimacy and international standing.[28] This ambition, however, was met with Ethiopian resistance and international complications.[29][16] This further aligned Italy with Nazi Germany, setting the stage for its involvement in World War II.[30]\n\n### Second Italo-Ethiopian War\n\n[edit]The Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928 stated that the border between Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was 21 leagues parallel to the Benadir coast. In 1934, a border clash at Ual-Ual between Italian and Ethiopian forces during a boundary survey provided Mussolini with a pretext for a war.[31] The Second Italo-Ethiopian War began without prior declaration of war in October 1935, with Italy sending a modern army of two hundred thousand soldiers commanded by Marshal Emilio De Bono and General Rodolfo Graziani (and later Pietro Badoglio). This army was equipped with superior weaponry, including an air force and tanks. Italian troops used mustard gas in aerial bombardments (in violation of the Geneva Protocol and Geneva Conventions) against combatants and civilians in an attempt to discourage the Ethiopian people from supporting the resistance.[32][33][34] This military superiority over the Ethiopian army, combined with the then Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie's initial strategy of engaging in frontal battles led to significant Italian victories.[35] During the late stages of the war, Italian forces violated international agreements by bombing Red Cross ambulances and hospitals, claiming these actions were in retaliation for alleged Ethiopian atrocities.[36][37]\n\nWhile some Italians initially opposed the war due to fears of a broader European conflict and Italy's financial instability, the Italian public largely shifted to support Mussolini following reported victories.[38] Selassie was forced to flee to England, with Italian forces entering the capital city, Addis Ababa by 5 May 1936. Shortly after, Mussolini proclaimed an \"Italian Empire of Ethiopia\" and the Italian Empire on May 9, 1936.[39] Following the Italian conquest, Ethiopian patriotic resistance continued in various parts of the country, particularly in the north and northwest. The resistance, although facing the challenge of Italy's modern military and harsh reprisals, prevented Italy from fully controlling Ethiopia and hindered its plans for economic and demographic exploitation.[40][16][41] This ongoing opposition set the stage for Ethiopia's eventual involvement in the Second World War.[15]\n\n### League of Nations\n\n[edit]Since 28 September 1923, the Ethiopian Empire had been one of the member states of the League of Nations after its membership was supported by Mussolini.[42] Following Italy's invasion, the League imposed economic sanctions on Italy, restricting trade in arms, rubber, and certain raw materials.[31] However, the sanctions did not include oil, which was needed for Italy's war effort.[43] France and Britain, concerned about maintaining good relations with Italy against the growing German threat, hesitated to enforce harsher penalties (appeasement). In 1936, the League lifted the sanctions, effectively legitimizing Italy's conquest. The failure of the League to protect the Ethiopian Empire exposed its weaknesses, demonstrating its inability to deter aggression from major powers. This failure was a key moment in the lead-up to World War II, undermining the League's credibility as a force for global peace.[10][11][12] Although Selassie fled to England and appealed to the League of Nations for help, many nations gradually recognized the Italian annexation for political and economic reasons.[44][45] On 18 November 1936, the Italian Empire was recognised by the Empire of Japan and Italy recognised the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, marking the end of the Stresa Front. Mussolini's international popularity further decreased as he endorsed the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, beginning a political tilt toward Germany that eventually led to the downfall of Mussolini and the Fascist regime in Italy in World War II.\n\nOn 12 May 1936, the League of Nations allowed Selassie to address the assembly. Selassie was introduced as \"His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Ethiopia\" (French: *Sa Majest\u00e9 Imperiale, l'Empereur d'\u00c9thiopie*), to jeering and whistling by Italian journalists.[46] The Romanian delegate Nicolae Titulescu shouted \"To the door with the savages!\" (Romanian: *A la porte les sauvages!*), and the journalists were removed from the hall. Selassie responded with a speech.[47][48][49][50] In a speech on 30 June 1936 to the assembly, he predicted \"It is us today, it will be you tomorrow\" if the League of Nations permitted Italian aggression.[12] Mussolini grew frustrated over the continued recognition of Selassie by the League of Nations and on 11 December 1937 announced the withdrawal of Italy's delegation to the League.[51]\n\n### Second World War\n\n[edit]On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France, which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in the Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French territories in the Horn of Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. (The Kingdom of Egypt remained neutral during World War II, but the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 allowed the British to occupy Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.)[52]: 6\u20137, 69 Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to invasion, but the *Comando Supremo* (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942. In the summer of 1940, Italy was far from ready for a long war or for the occupation of large areas of Africa.[52]: 38\u201340\n\nHostilities began on 13 June 1940, with an Italian air raid on the base of 1 Squadron Southern Rhodesian Air Force (237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF) at Wajir in the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya). In August 1940, the protectorate of British Somaliland was occupied by Italian forces and absorbed into Italian East Africa, which lasted around six months.[53] Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Selassie, South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, Wavell, Lieutenant-General William Platt and Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham. A plan to attack Italian East Africa, including support for Ethiopian resistance forces, was agreed.[54] General Wavell, commander of British troops in the Middle East, charged Colonel Sandford to make plans to aid and mobilize the Ethiopian patriots.[55][56]\n\nBy early 1941, Italian forces had been largely pushed back from Kenya and Sudan. On 6 April 1941, Addis Ababa was occupied by the 11th (African) Division, which received the surrender of the city.[52]: 421\u2013422 The remnants of the Italian forces in the Italian East Africa surrendered after staging a last stand at the Battle of Gondar in November 1941. In Ethiopia, some Italian forces continued to fight in an Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia against the British and Ethiopian forces until the Armistice of Cassibile (3 September 1943) ended hostilities between Italy and the Allies.[57] In January 1942, with the final official surrender of the Italians, the British signed an interim Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement with Selassie, acknowledging Ethiopian sovereignty. Makonnen Endelkachew was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed.\n\n### Treaty of Paris (1947)\n\n[edit]In the peace treaty of February 1947, Italy officially renounced sovereignty over its African colonies of Libya, Eritrea and Somalia (art. 23) and recognized the independence of Ethiopia (art. 33).[58] Italy further agreed to:\n\n- Pay war reparation of US$25,000,000 to Ethiopia\n- Accept \"Annex XI of the Treaty\", upon the recommendation of the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 390, that indicated that Eritrea was to be federated with Ethiopia.\n\nEritrea was placed under British military administration and became an autonomous part of Ethiopia in 1952. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as protectorates. In November 1949, the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland under close supervision, on condition that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.[59] British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, the Trust Territory of Somalia (ex-Italian Somaliland) became independent on 1 July 1960 and the territories united as the Somali Republic.[60]: 835 After the war, Italian Ethiopians were given a full pardon by the newly returned Selassie, as he saw the opportunity to continue the modernization efforts of the country.\n\n## Italian occupation\n\n[edit]### Administration\n\n[edit]Italian East Africa was administered by a single administrative unit, the Governo Generale dell'AOI. (GGAOI), with the city of Addis Abeba as its capital.[61][62] The colonial government was overseen by Ministry of Italian Africa (Italian: *Ministro per l'Africa italiana*) and was administered by a Viceroy of Ethiopia and Governor General of Italian East Africa, appointed by the Italian king. Victor Emmanuel III of Italy consequently adopted the title of \"Emperor of Ethiopia\". The dominion was further divided for administrative purposes into six governorates, further divided into forty *commissariati.*\n\nFascist colonial policy in Italian East Africa had a divide and conquer characteristic. To weaken the Orthodox Christian Amhara people who had run Ethiopia in the past, territory claimed by Eritrean Tigray-Tigrinyas and Somalis was given to the Eritrea Governorate and Somalia Governorate.[63]: 5 Reconstruction efforts after the war in 1936 were partially focused on benefiting the Muslim peoples in the colony at the expense of the Amhara to strengthen support by Muslims for the Italian colony.[63]: 5\n\nIn 1938 Mussolini enacted The Italian Racial Laws (Italian: *Leggi Razziali*), which institutionalized racial discrimination against Italian Jews and African inhabitants of the Italian Empire. These laws, and later a policy of pacification by apartheid, enforced segregation and reinforced racial hierarchies in Italy's colonies, further aligning Italian fascism with Nazi ideology. Italians and Natives were racially segregated and lived in separate parts of towns.[64] Interracial marriage was prohibited and so was having children between those of different races. However concubinages did exist. Those who were mixed-race could not get Italian citizenship or go to schools meant for Italians. Married Italian colonists had to bring their families and those who were unmarried could not employ servants.[65]\n\n### Territory\n\n[edit]When established in 1936, Italian East Africa consisted of the old Italian possessions in the Horn of Africa: Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, combined with the recently conquered Empire of Ethiopia.[66] The territory was divided into the six governorates: Eritrea and Somalia, consisting of the respective former colonies, enlarged with territory from Ethiopia. The remainder of \"Italian Ethiopia\" consisted of the Harar, Galla-Sidamo, Amhara, and Addis Abeba Governorates. The Addis Abeba Governorate was enlarged into the Scioa Governorate with territory from neighboring Harar, Galla-Sidamo and Amhara in November 1938.\n\nItalian East Africa was briefly enlarged in 1940, as Italian forces invaded British Somaliland, thereby bringing all Somali territories, aside from the small colony of French Somaliland, under Italian administration. At its largest extent, The colony occupied territories in British Somaliland, British Kenya, and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. However, it was dismembered only a year later, when in the course of the East African campaign.[67]\n\n### Economic development\n\n[edit]Italy's Fascist regime encouraged Italian peasants to colonize Ethiopia by setting up farms and small manufacturing businesses.[63]: 5 However, few Italians came to the Ethiopian colony, with most going to Eritrea and Somalia. While Italian Eritrea enjoyed some degree of development, supported by nearly 80,000 Italian colonists,[69] by 1940 only 3,200 farmers had arrived in Ethiopia, less than ten percent of the Fascist regime's goal.[63]: 6 Continued insurgency by native Ethiopians, lack of natural resources, rough terrain, and uncertainty of political and military conditions discouraged development and settlement in the countryside.[63]: 6\n\n#### Transportation and public works\n\n[edit]The Italians made a significant effort to build roads in the territory and most of the money given to the territory by the government for \"civilian works\" between 1937 and 1941 were for building roads.[70] The number of laborers numbered in the thousands and were recruited from Italy, Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen; though the most demanding work was left to laborers who were not Italian. It was reported that \"at the height of construction, nearly 64,000 Italians relocated to the AOI to build roads\".[71] Italians constructed a road between Addis Ababa and Massaua, Addis Ababa and Mogadishu, and Addis Ababa to Assab.[72]\n\nDams and hydroelectric plants were also built. Public companies were established in Ethiopian governorates, such as the Ethiopian Electricity Company (Italian: *Imprese elettriche d'Etiopia*).[73]\n\nItalians built additional airports and in 1936 started the *Linea dell'Impero*, a flight connecting Addis Ababa to Rome. The line was opened after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia and was followed by the first air links with the AOI governorates. The route was enlarged to 6,379 km and initially joined Rome with Addis Ababa via Syracuse, Benghazi, Cairo, Wadi Halfa, Khartoum, Kassala, Asmara, Dire Dawa.[73]\n\n900 km of railways were reconstructed or initiated (like the railway between Addis Ababa and Assab).[73] The Djibouti\u2013Addis Ababa Railway, the most significant railway in Italian East Africa, was acquired following the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936. Until 1935, steam trains operated the 784 km route, taking about 36 hours to travel between Addis Ababa and Djibouti. In 1938, Italy introduced four high-capacity \"Type 038\" rail-cars, derived from the Fiat ALn56 model, increasing speeds to 70 km\/h and reducing travel time to 18 hours. These diesel railcars remained in use until the mid-1960s. Major stations offered bus connections to other cities in Italian East Africa, and a fire brigade unit was established near Addis Ababa station\u2014the only one of its kind in Africa at the time.[74][75][76][77]\n\nItalians invested substantively in Ethiopian infrastructure development. However Ethiopia and Italian East Africa proved to be extremely expensive to maintain, as the budget for the fiscal year 1936\u201337 had been set at 19.136 billion lira to create the necessary infrastructure for the colony.[63]: 5 At the time, Italy's entire yearly revenue was only 18.581 billion lira.[63]: 5\n\n-\nThe Italian-era Ethiopian electric power corporation building, Addis Ababa\n-\nItalian commercial buildings in Massawa, Eritrea\n\n#### Agriculture\n\n[edit]Farming was encouraged particularly in Ethiopia for settlement purposes. Most of Italian East Africa's exports were bananas and pineapples. While most of Italy's exports to Italian East Africa were food products consisting of: \"wheat flour and semolina, pasta, salt, sugar, cheese, cured meats, canned vegetables and meat, olive oil, wine, spirits, and mineral water\". Farming was not as successful as anticipated by the Italians in Ethiopia due to factors such as having poor relations with native Ethiopians and having goals that were \"too ambitious to fulfill\". A sharecropping system was encouraged in Ethiopia by the Italian colonial authorities.

This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city. This political figure initially entered the national legislative body following a nationwide electoral contest, which distinctively integrated, for the first time, elected officials from several newly acquired territories.

Climate change and more than a century of fire exclusion and wildfire suppression have led to contemporary wildfires with more severe environmental impacts and human smoke exposure. Wildfires increase smoke exposure for broad swaths of the US population, though outdoor workers and socially disadvantaged groups with limited adaptive capacity can be disproportionally exposed. Exposure to wildfire smoke is associated with a range of health impacts in children and adults, including exacerbation of existing respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, worse birth outcomes, and cardiovascular events. Seasonally dry forests in Washington, Oregon, and California can benefit from ecological restoration as a way to adapt forests to climate change and reduce smoke impacts on affected communities.\n\n### Recent Findings\n\nEach wildfire season, large smoke events, and their adverse impacts on human health receive considerable attention from both the public and policymakers. The severity of recent wildfire seasons has state and federal governments outlining budgets and prioritizing policies to combat the worsening crisis. This surging attention provides an opportunity to outline the actions needed now to advance research and practice on conservation, economic, environmental justice, and public health interests, as well as the trade-offs that must be considered.\n\n### Summary\n\nScientists, planners, foresters and fire managers, fire safety, air quality, and public health practitioners must collaboratively work together. This article is the result of a series of transdisciplinary conversations to find common ground and subsequently provide a holistic view of how forest and fire management intersect with human health through the impacts of smoke and articulate the need for an integrated approach to both planning and practice.\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007\/s40572-022-00355-7.\n\n**Keywords:** Wildland fire, Public health, Air quality, Smoke, Exposure, Ecological restoration, Prescribed burning, Environmental justice, Interdisciplinary, Collaborative partnerships\n\n## Introduction\n\nFire is a globally significant phenomenon affecting both human and wildland ecosystems [1]. Area burned in the western United States (US) has increased steadily in recent decades despite suppression efforts [2, 3]. As contemporary wildfires grow larger and more severe, there is mounting recognition of an urgent need to integrate human health and ecosystem management perspectives due to the well-recognized and pervasive effects of smoke on human populations. Seasonally dry forests of the western US are iconic examples of this modern issue, where several key factors align: increasing area burned and increasing area burned at high severity [3, 4], anthropogenic climate change [5], and widespread calls to restore forests and protect ecosystem services, native biodiversity, and human communities [6].\n\nWe define wildland fire as any non-structural fire that occurs away from developed areas, including fires that are intentionally burned under prescription (prescribed fire) and unplanned fire events (wildfire). Some wildfires occur under conditions conducive to achieving ecological objectives if monitored and allowed to continue burning rather than being suppressed (managed wildfire). Prescribed fires and managed wildfires are conducted under targeted weather and fuel conditions to achieve land management objectives and limit smoke exposure as much as possible [7]. However, smoke exposure from any fire event can adversely affect exposed populations [8, 9]. The health impacts of smoke exposure include, but are not limited to, exacerbation of respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), irritation of the eye, nose, and throat, and adverse birth outcomes. These impacts are discussed further in the section \u201c*Health Effects of Wildfire Smoke Exposure*\u201d below.\n\nInequalities exist in individual susceptibility and exposure to smoke, and thus the intersections between wildland fire, forest health, and public health also expose potential environmental injustices. These inequalities are elaborated upon in the section \u201c*Affected Populations**.*\u201d To address this complex issue and advance research and practice, scientists, managers, and policymakers must approach wildland fire, smoke exposure, human health, and environmental justice more holistically. This could include increasing research with disproportionately impacted communities to identify potential solutions and strategies for fostering resilience and ensuring that these affected communities are centered in planning and action. Academic and region-based groups and institutions have begun discussions of transdisciplinary approaches, but more rapid progress in theory, practice, and policy is needed [10\u201312].\n\nThe goal of this review is to articulate consensus-driven, evidence-based approaches to identify and communicate the human health and environmental justice (EJ) implications of exposure to smoke within a forest restoration and adaptive management framework. This review results from extended discussions among a transdisciplinary group of scientists and practitioners in forest ecology and management, fire science, fire safety, air quality, and public health. It provides an overview of the past, present, and future of wildland fire, forest ecology, and forest management in seasonally dry forests of the western US; summarizes existing knowledge about smoke exposures, health effects, and disproportionately affected populations; and provides transdisciplinary synthesis including consensus statements and recommendations for a path forward.\n\nTo advance the dialogue and research agenda, we ask: (1) what are the public health outcomes of *status quo* fire and smoke management in the western US, and how might smoke emissions and associated health outcomes be reduced by alternative management scenarios? We also ask: (2) how might public health be most effectively and equitably incorporated into the management of western US forest landscapes historically maintained by fire?\n\nFor this review, we specifically focus on the potential of restorative actions in seasonally dry forests [13\u201315] of the western US to mitigate the increasingly negative impacts of fire on human health. Smoke crosses all boundaries, and emissions from local, regional, and international fire events all impact human health [16, 17]. However, in this manuscript, we place particular emphasis on the Pacific states of California, Oregon, and Washington, which is the geographical location referenced when \u201cwestern US\u201d is used. Our focus here provides a transdisciplinary anchor from which to establish future discussions and actions regarding trade-offs between human health, health equity, and smoke emissions from fire and forest management.\n\n## Fire Exclusion and the Rise of Modern Western Wildfires\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, burned area in seasonally dry western US forests began a steady increase [18] despite escalating fire suppression expenditures [19]. Seasonally dry coniferous forests include pine-dominated and dry or moist mixed-conifer forests that are dry enough to burn most years during the wildfire season. Climate change contributes to increased burned area in seasonally dry forests through warmer seasonal temperatures, longer and drier summers, below-average winter precipitation, and earlier snowmelt [18, 20] (Fig. 1). Under warmer, drier, and longer fire seasons, the incidence of large wildfires in the western US has steadily increased over the last 30 years [3, 21]. Based on climate change projections, area burned in the western US is expected to double or triple by mid-century [4, 22].\n\nHistorically, fire was the dominant natural disturbance shaping western US landscapes [23, 24]. While increasing burned area is strongly associated with anthropogenic climate warming [5], humans have markedly changed native forests and associated fire regimes as characterized by fire frequency and severity. Historically, many seasonally dry western US forests experienced fire every several decades, and some burned on regular intervals of 10 years or less, with generally widespread low-severity surface fire and more localized high-severity tree-killing fire [14]. Euro-American colonization brought changes in land use and land management, including curtailed Indigenous burning that led to abrupt and persistent declines in fire frequency beginning more than 170 years ago [25]. Fire exclusion led to increased forest density and accumulation of live and dead fuels [26]. As a result, the contemporary forests and regenerating forests that are developing after recent large fires bear little resemblance to forests that developed under more characteristic fire regimes [24, 27, 28]. Fire regime characteristics include the total amount of burned area, the distribution of fire event and fire severity patch sizes, and the frequency, intensity, seasonality, and spatial distribution of fires themselves, all of which vary by forest type and physiography (Fig. 1C). Changes to characteristic fire regimes adversely impact myriad ecosystem functions that might otherwise offer social and ecological benefit [6, 14].\n\nRecent large fire events across the western US have called attention to the need to restore frequent fire and cultural burning practices [29, 30] and to address the detrimental impacts of fire exclusion. Much can be learned from traditional Indigenous practice when it comes to burning. Native Americans in the western US traditionally used fire extensively and for a wide variety of reasons. Some estimates put the area burned in California alone to 1.6 million hectare (ha) per year before Euro-American colonization [31]. However, traditional Indigenous burning practices [32] were considered undesirable and banned from modern forest management practices early in the twentieth century [33] by the US government [34]. Although there has been increasing recognition of the knowledge that can be gained from Indigenous burning practices, current forest conditions and fire suppression policies are impeding efforts to recover Indigenous fire stewardship, associated cultural, social, and spiritual practices, and food security [35, 36].\n\n## Smoke, Human Communities, and Natural Ecosystems\n\nIn 2020 alone, over 4.1 million ha burned during summer wildfires in Washington, Oregon, and California [37]. While large fire years can be seen in the historical record throughout the western US [38], large fire events are now responsible for over 90% of burned area and significant increases in fire severity [3, 39]. Given the dramatic rise in western US wildfires and the tremendous amount of smoke emitted by these events, prolonged smoke exposure is impacting communities both near and distant from the actual wildfires [40]. Regional fire events across the western US are expected to increase even under the most optimistic climatic scenarios [3, 5, 41]. Warmer, drier summers \u2014 combined with drought and wind events \u2014 are catalysts for regional wildfires, smoke, and persistent haze. Of particular concern are synchronous large fires (so-called megafires > 40,000 ha), which are having the most significant ecological, economic, social, and human health impacts within and across regions [42\u201344].\n\nIn western US conifer forests, wildfires generally range from low-severity fires that burn surface fuels below forest canopies to high-severity crown fires that burn both surface fuels and tree crowns [45]. However, many seasonally dry forests are now more susceptible to high-severity fire events due to the legacy of fire exclusion. High-severity crown fires represent a maximum amount of fuel consumption, energy release, and smoke emissions that a fire can generate. In places where organic soils and coarse wood have accumulated under a prolonged period of fire exclusion, smoke production from large, high-severity fires can last for weeks and months [46\u201348], and can often only be extinguished by a season ending weather event.\n\nRecent wildfire seasons underscore the regional and international smoke impacts on communities [16, 48\u201350]. Community exposure to smoke is one of the most important public health and health equity considerations in fire management and community planning [51]. Recent long-duration smoke events associated with regional wildfires highlight communities that are particularly susceptible to smoke impacts, including those that are not prepared for extended periods of unhealthy air [8, 52, 53]. Another challenge in the western US is rapid population growth over the last three decades, which has led to drastic land use changes and urban expansion, with particularly rapid growth in fire prone areas of the wildland urban interface (WUI) [54, 55]. As people move from urban areas to suburban and rural communities, more people are directly exposed to prescribed fire and local smoke events [56, 57]. A substantial percentage of the population within California (3.3%), Washington (9.6%), and Oregon (15.9%) lives in very close proximity of seasonally dry forests (Table 1), which is particularly important from a land management perspective.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| In WUI overlapping seasonally dry forests | In WUI + 1 km buffer | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Population (% of total population) |\nHousing unit (% of total housing units) |\nPopulation (% of total population) |\nHousing unit (% of total housing units) |\n|\nWA |\n43,536 (0.6) | 22,457 (0.8) | 644,947 (9.6) | 307,344 (10.7) |\nOR |\n64,767 (1.7) | 29,334 (1.8) | 609,964 (15.9) | 282,124 (16.9) |\nCA |\n103,494 (0.3) | 56,362 (0.4) | 1,230,627 (3.3) | 649,875 (4.8) |\n\n## Forest Restoration and Fire Management\n\nForest restoration in seasonally dry pine and mixed-conifer forests aims to modify the current forest fuel structure to reflect conditions supported by more characteristic active fire regimes within a changing climate. Interventions include reducing tree density, favoring larger tree sizes, and fire-tolerant tree species with the goal of promoting resilience to future disturbance and climate change [13, 14, 59]. Increasing the extent of forest restoration treatments is essential to preserve forest ecosystems into the future as the extent and severity of wildfires and other disturbances increase. Historical fire regimes effectively maintained variation in tree cover and species composition at scales ranging from one hectare to hundreds of thousands of hectares [14, 60]. Such variation and its inherent resiliency are what forest restoration ultimately strives to re-create [59]. Although this review is focused on seasonally dry forests, the lessons learned may become more widely applicable as more forests become drier for longer intervals, and therefore more susceptible to a more active fire regime.\n\nRestoration in seasonally dry forests usually involves strategic fuel reduction, and the retention of more fire-resistant tree species [61]. While fuel reduction can involve mechanical or hand thinning of trees and shrubs, it usually requires the application of prescribed fire to effectively moderate future fire severity [62, 63]. Fire is often used as part of a fuel reduction treatment, ranging from the targeted burning of hand or machine piled fuels created during thinning to the planned, intentional application of broadcast prescribed fire across a landscape to consume residual surface fuels, to the management of unplanned lightning ignitions to burn at low-to-moderate severities across a landscape where ecologically appropriate (managed wildfire for resource benefit).\n\nThese different fuel reduction techniques \u2014 thinning, pile burning, prescribed fire, and managed fire \u2014 vary in their effectiveness, duration, expense, and smoke production. Each of these techniques can effectively mitigate subsequent wildfire behavior and lessen smoke production until surface and canopy fuels once again increase [64], which can occur within 10\u201320 years of implementation [65]. Thus, continued treatment maintenance using prescribed fire or managed wildfire is often the most financially cost-effective approach, particularly if treatments can be used as potential control locations on the landscape to contain larger managed wildfires [2]. A growing body of research on forest restoration in seasonally dry forests concluded that fuel treatments generally require (1) an initial application of fire to reduce subsequent wildfire intensity (summarized in Prichard et al. 2021), and (2) continued burning of increasingly large landscapes to efficiently maintain the reacquired resilience [2, 66, 67]. As such, smoke exposure is an inevitable byproduct of any effective restoration [44]. Understanding and accounting for smoke production versus exposure and its health effects is critical to evaluating the impact that forest restoration and fire management have on public health.\n\n## Affected Populations\n\nHere, vulnerability encompasses a greater likelihood of exposure, a greater sensitivity to the health of well-being impacts of exposure, or greater susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt [68]. The adaptive capacity of a community is defined by its ability to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences [69]. The resilience of a community is defined by its ability to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from a hazardous event \u2014 responding in ways that maintain essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity to adapt, learn, and bounce forward [70, 71]. The building blocks of community resilience include the socioeconomic context, community assets, and social capital, all of which are necessary for broader system resilience and adaptation [71\u201373]. Examples of vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and resilience metrics available for western US are shown in Supplemental Table 3.\n\nTo integrate equity into forest management, each community\u2019s vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and resilience must be taken into consideration. One pathway to equity can be achieved through community-tailored, culturally informed smoke management practices, achieved through early and continuous consultation with impacted communities. Another path toward equity is through policy, in which researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and managers purposefully integrate the principles of EJ across all aspects of their work. Formal definitions of EJ can provide practitioners with an initial lens. As example, Washington State recently passed the Healthy Environment for All (HEAL) Act, which establishes a formal definition of environmental justice in Washington and expands on the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) definition (underlined): \u201cEnvironmental justice means the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, rules, and policies. Environmental justice includes addressing disproportionate environmental health impacts in all laws, rules, and policies with environmental impacts by prioritizing vulnerable populations and overburdened communities, the equitable distribution of resources and benefits, and eliminating harm\u201d [74]. In the context of wildfires, EJ would focus mitigation on those most impacted by smoke exposure, seek to address past and current damages, and inspire structural change to prevent future harm. The ethical imperative is to prevent disproportionate burden of smoke on vulnerable communities.\n\nSmoke from wildland\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_df5f21fd7de7400c84eda00d\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Socioeconomic constraints to biomass removal from forest lands for fire risk reduction in the western U.S.\\\\\\\" Nicholls Halbrook Benedum\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Socioeconomic Constraints to Biomass Removal from ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4907\/9\/5\/264\nby DL Nicholls \u00b7 2018 \u00b7 Cited by 49 \u2014 Socioeconomic Constraints to Biomass Removal from Forest Lands for Fire Risk Reduction in the Western U.S. ...

It has a normal operating range of 1,000\u20133,000 kilometres (620\u20131,860 mi). The network is used in the defence of Australia, and can also monitor maritime operations, wave heights, and wind directions.\n\nJORN's main ground stations comprise a control centre, known as the JORN Coordination Centre (JCC), at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia and three transmission stations: Radar 1 near Longreach, Queensland, Radar 2 near Laverton, Western Australia and Radar 3 near Alice Springs, Northern Territory.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The roots of the JORN can be traced back to post World War II experiments in the United States and a series of Australian experiments at DSTO Edinburgh, South Australia[1] beginning in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1969, The Technical Cooperation Program membership and papers by John Strath prompted development of a core *Over the Horizon* radar project.[1]\n\nFrom July 1970 a study was undertaken; this resulted in a proposal for a program to be carried out, in three phases, to develop an over-the-horizon-radar system.[2][3]\n\n### Geebung\n\n[edit]Phase 1, *Project Geebung*, aimed to define operational requirements for an OHR and study applicable technologies and techniques. The project carried out a series of ionospheric soundings evaluating the suitability of the ionosphere for the operation of an OTHR.[3]\n\n### Jindalee\n\n[edit]Phase 2, *Project Jindalee*, aimed at proving the feasibility and costing of OHR. This second phase was carried out by the Radar Division, (later, the High Frequency Radar Division), of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). Project Jindalee came into being during the period 1972\u20131974 and was divided into three stages.[3]\n\nStage 'A' commenced in April 1974. It involved the construction of a prototype radar receiver at Mount Everard, (near Alice Springs), a transmitter (at Harts Range, 160 kilometres or 99 miles away) and a beacon in Derby. When completed (in October 1976) the Stage A radar ran for two years, closing in December 1978. Stage A formally ended in February 1979, having achieved its mission of proving the feasibility of OTHR.[3] The success of stage A resulted in the construction of a larger stage 'B' radar, drawing on the knowledge gained from stage A.\n\nStage 'B' commenced on 6 July 1978. The new radar was constructed next to the stage A radar. Developments during stage B included real time signal processing, custom built processors, larger antenna arrays, and higher power transmitters, which resulted in a more sensitive and capable radar.\n\n- The first data was received by stage B in the period April\u2013May 1982,\n- the first ship was detected in January 1983, and\n- an aircraft was automatically tracked in February 1984.\n\nTrials were carried out with the Royal Australian Air Force during April 1984, substantially fulfilling the mission of stage B, to demonstrate an OHR operating in Australia. Another two years of trials were carried out before the Jindalee project officially finished in December 1985.[3]\n\nStage 'C' became the conversion of the stage B radar to an operational radar. This stage saw substantial upgrades to the stage B equipment followed by the establishment of No. 1 Radar Surveillance Unit RAAF (1RSU) and the handover of the radar to 1RSU. The aim was to provide the Australian Defence Force with operational experience of OHR.[4]\n\n### JORN\n\n[edit]#### Phase 3\n\n[edit]Phase 3 of the OTHR program was the design and construction of the JORN. The decision to build the JORN was announced in October 1986. Telstra, in association with GEC-Marconi, became the prime contractor and a fixed price contract for the construction of the JORN was signed on 11 June 1991. The JORN was to be completed by 13 June 1997.[4]\n\n#### Phase 3 Project problems\n\n[edit]Telstra was responsible for software development and systems integration, areas in which it had no previous experience. GEC-Marconi was responsible for the HF Radar and related software aspects of the project, areas in which it had no previous experience.[5] Other unsuccessful tenderers for the project included experienced Australian software development and systems integration company, BHP IT, and experienced Australian defence contractor AWA Defence Industries. Both of these companies are no longer in business.[6]\n\nBy 1996, the project was experiencing technical difficulties and cost overruns.[4][7] Telstra reported a A$609-million loss and announced that it could not guarantee a delivery date.[8]\n\nThe failed Telstra contract prompted the project to enter a fourth phase.\n\n#### Phase 4\n\n[edit]Phase 4 involved the completion of the JORN and its subsequent maintenance using a new contractor. In February 1997 Lockheed Martin and Tenix received a contract to deliver and manage the JORN. Subsequently, during June 1997 Lockheed and Tenix formed the company RLM Group to handle the joint venture.[9] An operational radar system was delivered in April 2003, with maintenance contracted to continue until February 2007.[10]\n\nIn August 2008, Lockheed Martin acquired Tenix Group's interest in RLM Holdings.[11]\n\n#### Phase 5\n\n[edit]As a consequence of the duration of its construction, the JORN delivered in 2003 was designed to a specification developed in the early 1990s. During this period the Alice Springs radar had evolved significantly under the guidance of the Defence Science & Technology Organisation. In February 2004 a fifth phase of the JORN project was approved.\n\nPhase 5 aimed to upgrade the Laverton and Longreach radars to reflect over a decade of OTHR research and development. It was scheduled to run until approximately the year 2011,[10] but was completed around 2013\/2014 due to skills shortage. All three stations are now similar, and use updated electronics.[12]\n\n#### Phase 6\n\n[edit]In March 2018 it was announced that BAE Systems Australia would undertake the $1.2 billion upgrade to Australia\u2019s Jindalee Operational Radar Network, which was expected to take 10 years to complete.[13][ needs update]\n\n## Project cost\n\n[edit]The JORN project (JP2025) has had 5 phases,[14] and has cost approximately $1.8 billion.[ citation needed] The ANAO Audit report of June 1996 estimated an overall project cost for Phase 3 of $1.1 billion.\n\n[15]Phase 5 costs have been estimated at $70 million.\n\n[14]Phase 6 costs expect to be $1.2 billion.\n\n[13]\n\n## Technology export\n\n[edit]On 18 March 2025, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney announced the AU$6.5 billion purchase of JORN radar technology by Canada, for deployment over the Arctic.[16]\n\n## Network\n\n[edit]JORN consists of:\n\n- three active radar stations: one near Longreach, Queensland (Radar 1), a second near Laverton, Western Australia (Radar 2), and a third near Alice Springs, Northern Territory (Radar 3);\n- a control centre at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia (JCC);\n- seven transponders; and\n- twelve vertical ionosondes distributed around Australia and its territories.\n[4]\n\nDSTO previously used the radar station near Alice Springs, Northern Territory (known as Jindalee Facility Alice Springs) for research and development[17] and also has its own network of vertical\/oblique ionosondes for research purposes.[4][18][19]\nThe Alice Springs radar was fully integrated into the JORN during Phase 5 to provide a third active radar station.[17]\n\nEach radar station consists of a transmitter site and a receiver site, separated by a large distance to prevent the transmitter from interfering with the receiver. The JORN transmitter and receiver sites are:\n\n- the Queensland transmitter at Longreach,\n[20]with 90-degree coverage (23\u00b039\u203229\u2033S 144\u00b008\u203244\u2033E \/ 23.658047\u00b0S 144.145432\u00b0E), - the Queensland receiver at Stonehenge,\n[20]with 90-degree coverage (24\u00b017\u203228\u2033S 143\u00b011\u203243\u2033E \/ 24.291095\u00b0S 143.195286\u00b0E), - the Western Australian transmitter at Leonora,\n[20]with 180-degree coverage (28\u00b019\u203203\u2033S 122\u00b050\u203236\u2033E \/ 28.317378\u00b0S 122.843456\u00b0E), and - the Western Australian receiver at Laverton, with 180-degree coverage (28\u00b019\u203236\u2033S 122\u00b000\u203219\u2033E \/ 28.326747\u00b0S 122.005234\u00b0E).\n- the Alice Springs transmitter at Harts Range,\n[20][21]with 90-degree coverage (22\u00b058\u203203\u2033S 134\u00b026\u203253\u2033E \/ 22.967561\u00b0S 134.447937\u00b0E), and - the Alice Springs receiver at Mount Everard,\n[20][21]with 90-degree coverage (23\u00b031\u203217\u2033S 133\u00b040\u203239\u2033E \/ 23.521497\u00b0S 133.677521\u00b0E).\n\nThe Alice Springs radar was the original 'Jindalee Stage B' test bed on which the design of the other two stations was based. It continues to act as a research and development testbed in addition to its operational role.\n\nThe Mount Everard receiver site contains the remains of the first, smaller, 'Jindalee Stage A' receiver. It is visible in aerial photos, behind the stage B receiver (23\u00b031\u203248\u2033S 133\u00b041\u203216\u2033E \/ 23.530074\u00b0S 133.68782\u00b0E). The stage A transmitter was rebuilt to become the stage B transmitter.[3]\n\nThe high frequency radio transmitter arrays at Longreach and Laverton have 28 elements, each driven by a 20-kilowatt power amplifier giving a total power of 560 kW.[4] Stage B transmitted 20 kW per amplifier.[4] The signal is bounced off the ionosphere, landing in the \"illuminated\" area of target interest. Much incident radiation is reflected forward in the original direction of travel, but a small proportion \"backscatters\" and returns along the original, reciprocal transmission path. These returns again reflect from the ionosphere, finally being received at the Longreach and Laverton stations. Signal attenuation, from transmit antenna to target and finally back to receive antenna, is substantial, and its performance in such a context marks this system as leading-edge science. The receiver stations use KEL Aerospace KFR35 series receivers.[17] JORN uses radio frequencies between 5 and 30 MHz,[22][23][24] which is far lower than most other civilian and military radars that operate in the microwave frequency band. Also, unlike most microwave radars, JORN does not use pulsed transmission, nor does it use movable antennas. Transmission is Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW), and the transmitted beam is aimed by the interaction between its \"beam-steering\" electronics and antenna characteristics in the transmit systems. Radar returns are distinguished in range by the offset between the instantaneous radiated signal frequency and the returning signal frequency. Returns are distinguished in azimuth by measuring phase offsets of individual returns incident across the kilometres-plus length of the multi-element receiving antenna array. Intensive computational work is necessary to JORN's operation, and refinement of the software suite offers the most cost-effective path for improvements.\n\nThe JORN ionosonde network is made up of vertical ionosondes, providing a real time map of the ionosphere. Each vertical incidence sounder (VIS) is a standardized Single-Receiver Digisonde Portable Sounder,[25] built by University of Massachusetts Lowell for the JORN. A new ionospheric map is generated every 225 seconds.[19] In a clockwise direction around Australia, the locations of the twelve (11 active and one test) JORN ionosondes are below.\n\nThe DSTO ionosonde network is not part of the JORN, but is used to further DSTO's research goals.[19] DSTO uses Four-Receiver Digisonde Portable Sounders (DPS-4), also built by Lowell.[4][18] During 2004 DSTO had ionosondes at the following locations.\n\n- DSTO Ionosondes\n[18]\n\nFrom west to east, the seven JORN transponders are located at\n\n- Christmas Island\n[4][17](OzGeoRFMap), - Broome, WA\n[4][26](OzGeoRFMap), - Kalumburu, WA\n[20](OzGeoRFMap), - Darwin, NT\n[4](OzGeoRFMap), - Nhulunbuy, NT\n[4][20](OzGeoRFMap), - Normanton, Qld\n[4][20](OzGeoRFMap), and - Horn island, Qld\n[4][20](OzGeoRFMap).\n\nAll of the above sites (and many more that likely form part of the network) can be found precisely on the RadioFrequency Map,[27] which also lists the frequencies in use at each site.\n\n## Operation and uses\n\n[edit]The JORN network is operated by No. 1 Remote Sensor Unit (1RSU). Data from the JORN sites is fed to the JORN Coordination Centre at RAAF Base Edinburgh where it is passed on to other agencies and military units. Officially the system allows the Australian Defence Force to observe air and sea activity north of Australia to distances up to 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi).[28] This encompasses all of Java, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and may include Singapore.[29]\nHowever, in 1997, the prototype was able to detect missile launches by China[30] over 5,500 kilometres (3,400 mi) away.\n\nJORN is so sensitive it is able to track planes as small as a Cessna 172 taking off and landing in East Timor 2,600 kilometres (1,600 mi) away.[ citation needed] Current research is anticipated to increase its sensitivity by a factor of ten beyond this level.\n\n[31]\n\nIt is also reportedly able to detect stealth aircraft, as typically these are designed only to avoid detection by microwave radar.[8] Project DUNDEE[32] was a cooperative research project, with American missile defence research, into using JORN to detect missiles.[33] The JORN was anticipated to play a role in future Missile Defense Agency initiatives, detecting and tracking missile launches in Asia.[34]\n\nAs JORN is reliant on the interaction of signals with the ionosphere ('bouncing'), disturbances in the ionosphere adversely affect performance. The most significant factor influencing this is solar changes, which include sunrise, sunset and solar disturbances. The effectiveness of JORN is also reduced by extreme weather, including lightning and rough seas.[35]\n\nAs JORN uses the Doppler principle to detect objects, it cannot detect objects moving at a tangent to the system, or objects moving at a similar speed to their surroundings.[35]\n\n## Engineering heritage award\n\n[edit]JORN received an Engineering Heritage International Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.[36]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- Cobra Mist\n- Duga radar, a similar Russian system\n- Imaging radar\n\n## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b***DST*.*Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN)*.

The mosque had been the subject of a lengthy socio-political dispute, and was targeted after a political rally organised by Hindu nationalist organisations turned violent.\n\nIn Hindu tradition, the city of Ayodhya is the birthplace of Rama. In the 16th century, a Mughal commander, Mir Baqi, had built a mosque, known as the Babri Masjid at a site identified by some Hindus as Ram Janmabhoomi, or the birthplace of Rama. The Archaeological Survey of India states that the mosque was built on land where a non-Islamic structure had previously existed.[2][3] In the 1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to Rama at the site, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as its political voice. Several rallies and marches were held as a part of this movement, including the *Ram Rath Yatra* led by L. K. Advani.\n\nOn 6 December 1992, the VHP and the BJP organised a rally at the site involving 150,000 people. The rally turned violent, and the crowd overwhelmed security forces and tore down the mosque. A subsequent inquiry into the incident found 68 people responsible, including several leaders of the BJP and the VHP. The demolition resulted in several months of intercommunal rioting between India's Hindu and Muslim communities, causing the death of at least 2,000 people. Retaliatory violence against Hindus also occurred in Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n## Background\n\n| Ayodhya dispute |\n|---|\n| Organizations |\n\nIn Hinduism, the birthplace of the deity Rama, known as \"Ram Janmabhoomi\", is considered a holy site. This site is often believed to be at the place where the Babri Masjid stood in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh: historical evidence to support this belief is scarce.[4][5] There is a rough scholarly consensus that in 1528, following the Mughal conquest of the region, a mosque was built at the site by the Mughal commander Mir Baqi, and named the \"Babri Masjid\" after the Mughal emperor Babur.[6][7][a] Popular belief holds that Baqi demolished a temple of Rama to build the mosque; historical basis for the belief is debated.[4][5] Archaeological evidence has been found of a structure pre-dating the mosque. This structure has been variously identified as a Hindu temple and a Buddhist structure.[4][6]\n\nThe claim that the mosque stood on the site of a temple was first made in 1822, by an official of the Faizabad court.[6][7] The Nirmohi Akhara sect cited this statement in laying claim to the site later in the 19th century, leading to the first recorded incidents of religious violence at the site in 1855.[7][8] The British colonial administration set up a railing in 1859, to separate the outer courtyard of the mosque to avoid disputes. The status quo persisted until 1949, when idols of Rama were reportedly placed inside the mosque, allegedly by Hindu Mahasabha activists. This led to an uproar, with both parties filing civil suits laying claim to the land. The placement of the idols was seen as a desecration by the users of the Masjid. The site was declared to be in dispute, and the gates to the Masjid were locked.[7][9]\n\nIn the 1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to Rama at the site, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as its political voice.[7][10] The movement was bolstered by the decision of a district judge, who ruled in 1986 that the gates would be reopened and Hindus permitted to worship there.[7][9] This decision was endorsed by Indian National Congress politician Rajiv Gandhi, at that time the Prime Minister of India, who sought to regain support from Hindus he had lost over the Shah Bano controversy.[6][7] Nonetheless, the Congress lost the 1989 general election, and the BJP's strength in parliament grew from 2 members to 88, making its support crucial to the new government of V. P. Singh.[7][11]\n\nIn September 1990, BJP leader L. K. Advani began a *Rath Yatra*, a political rally travelling across much of north India to Ayodhya. The *yatra* sought to generate support for the proposed temple, and also sought to unite Hindu votes by mobilizing anti-Muslim sentiment.[12] Advani was arrested by the Government of Bihar before he could reach Ayodhya. Despite this, a large body of Sangh Parivar supporters reached Ayodhya and attempted to attack the mosque. This resulted in a pitched battle with the paramilitary forces that ended with the death of several rioters. The BJP withdrew its support to the V. P. Singh ministry, necessitating fresh elections. The BJP substantially increased its tally in the union parliament, as well as winning a majority in the Uttar Pradesh assembly.[11]\n\n## Demolition\n\nOn 6 December 1992, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its affiliates organised a rally involving 150,000 VHP and BJP supporters at the site of the disputed structure. The ceremonies included speeches by BJP leaders such as Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti.[13] During the first few hours of the rally, the crowd grew gradually more restless, and began raising slogans. A police cordon had been placed around the structure in preparation for attack. However, around noon, a young man managed to slip past the cordon and climb the structure itself, brandishing a saffron flag. This was seen as a signal by the mob, who then stormed the structure. The police cordon, vastly outnumbered and unprepared for the size of the attack, fled. The mob set upon the building with axes, hammers, and grappling hooks, and within a few hours, the entire structure, made from mud and chalk, was levelled.[14][15]\n\nThe then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao has been often criticized for his mishandling of the situation. Rao in his book *Ayodhya 6 December 1992* wrote that the demolition was a \"betrayal\" by the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Kalyan Singh, who repeatedly assured the Congress government that the mosque would be protected.[16]\n\nA 2009 report, authored by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, found 68 people to be responsible for the demolition of the Masjid, mostly leaders from the BJP. Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, Joshi and Vijaya Raje Scindia. Kalyan Singh, who was then the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, also faced severe criticism in the report. Liberhan wrote that he posted bureaucrats and police officers to Ayodhya whose record indicated that they would stay silent during the mosque's demolition.[17] Anju Gupta, a police officer who had been in charge of Advani's security on that day, stated that Advani and Joshi made speeches that contributed to provoking the behaviour of the mob.[18] The report notes that at this time several BJP leaders made \"feeble requests to the kar sevaks to come down... either in earnest or for the media's benefit\". No appeal was made to the rioters not to enter the *sanctum sanctorum* or not to demolish the structure. It further noted: \"This selected act of the leaders itself speaks of the hidden intentions of one and all being to accomplish demolition of the disputed structure.\" The report holds that the \"icons of the movement present [that day]... could just as easily have... prevented the demolition.\"[19]\n\n### Allegations\n\nIn a March 2005 book, former Intelligence Bureau head Maloy Krishna Dhar claimed that the Babri mosque demolition was planned 10 months in advance by top leaders of the RSS, BJP and VHP, and criticised the manner in which the then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao handled the issue. Dhar claimed that he was directed to arrange security for a meeting between individuals from the BJP and other constituents of the Sangh Parivar, and that the meeting \"proved beyond doubt that they (RSS, BJP, VHP) had drawn up the blueprint of the Hindutva assault in the coming months and choreographed the *pralaya nritya* (dance of apocalypse) at Ayodhya in December 1992\".[20]\n\nThe RSS, BJP, VHP and the Bajrang Dal leaders present in the meeting amply agreed to work in a well-orchestrated manner.\" Claiming that the tapes of the meeting were personally handed over by him to his boss, he asserts that he has no doubts that his boss had shared the contents with the Prime Minister (Rao) and the Home Minister (Shankarrao Chavan). The author claimed that there was silent agreement that Ayodhya offered \"a unique opportunity to take the Hindutva wave to the peak for deriving political benefit.\"[20]\n\nIn April 2014, a sting operation by Cobrapost claimed that the demolition was not an act of frenzied mobs but an act of sabotage planned with so much secrecy that no government agency got wind of it. It further said that the sabotage was planned several months in advance by VHP and Shiv Sena, but not jointly.[21]\n\n## Aftermath\n\nIn protest against the arrest of *karsevaks* after the demolition, a man later identified as Satish Chandra Pandey attempted to hijack Indian Airlines Flight 810 from Lucknow to Delhi on 22 January 1993. Pandey demanded the release of the arrestees and the construction of a temple at the site of the mosque. Pandey eventually surrendered, and was sentenced to four years in prison.[22][23][24][25][26]\n\n### Communal violence\n\nThe destruction of the Babri Masjid sparked Muslim outrage around the country, provoking several months of inter-communal rioting in which Hindus and Muslims attacked one another, burning and looting homes, shops and places of worship.[14] Several of the BJP leaders were taken into custody, and the VHP was briefly banned by the government. Despite this, the ensuing riots spread to cities like Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad, Kanpur, Delhi, Bhopal and several others, eventually resulting in over 2000 deaths, mainly Muslim.[14] The Mumbai Riots alone, which occurred in December 1992 and January 1993 and which the Shiv Sena played a big part in organising, caused the death of around 900 people, and estimated property damage of around \u20b9 9,000 crore ($3.6 billion).[27][28][29] The demolition and the ensuing riots were among the major factors behind the 1993 Mumbai bombings and many successive riots in the coming decade.[30] Jihadi groups including the Indian Mujahideen cited the demolition of the Babri Masjid as a reason for their terrorist attacks.[31][32]\n\n### Investigation\n\nOn 16 December 1992, the Union home ministry set up the Liberhan Commission to investigate the destruction of the mosque, headed by retired High Court Judge M. S. Liberhan. After 399 sittings over sixteen years, the Commission submitted its 1,029-page report to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 30 June 2009.[33] According to the report, the events of 6 December 1992, in Ayodhya were \"neither spontaneous nor unplanned\".[34] In March 2015, the Supreme Court of India admitted a petition alleging that, with a BJP government in power, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) would not pursue conspiracy charges against senior BJP leaders including L. K. Advani and Rajnath Singh.[35] The Court asked the CBI to explain its delay in filing an appeal.[36][37] In April 2017, a special CBI court framed criminal conspiracy charges against Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar, and several others.[38]\n\n### Judicial verdict\n\nOn 30 September 2020, the court acquitted all the 32 accused including L. K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar and several others in the case on account of inconclusive evidence.[39] The special court judge Surendra Kumar Yadav[40] said, \"The demolition was not pre-planned.\"[41][42]\n\n## International reactions\n\n### Pakistan\n\nIn Pakistan, the government closed offices and schools on 7 December to protest against the demolition of the Babri Masjid.[43] The Pakistani Foreign Ministry summoned the Indian ambassador to lodge a formal complaint, and promised to appeal to the United Nations and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference to pressure India to protect the rights of Muslims.[43] Strikes were held across the country, while Muslim mobs attacked and destroyed as many as 30 Hindu temples in one day by means of fire and bulldozers, and stormed the office of Air India, India's national airline, in Lahore.[43][44] The retaliatory attacks included rhetoric from mobs calling for the destruction of India and of Hinduism.[43] Students from the Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad burned an effigy of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, and called for \"jihad\" against Hindus.[43] In subsequent years, thousands of Pakistani Hindus visiting India sought longer visas, and in some cases citizenship of India, citing increased harassment and discrimination in the aftermath of the demolition.[45]\n\n### Bangladesh\n\nFollowing the demolition, Muslim mobs in Bangladesh attacked and burned down Hindu temples, shops and houses across the country.[46] An India-Bangladesh cricket match was disrupted when a mob of an estimated 5,000 men tried to storm the Bangabandhu National Stadium in the national capital of Dhaka.[46] The Dhaka office of Air India was stormed and destroyed.[43] 10 people were reportedly killed, 11 Hindu temples and several homes destroyed.[46][47][48] The aftermath of the violence forced the Bangladeshi Hindu community to curtail the celebrations of Durga Puja in 1993 while calling for the destroyed temples to be repaired and investigations be held.[46]\n\n### Middle East\n\nAt its summit meeting in Abu Dhabi, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) strongly condemned the Babri Masjid demolition. It adopted a resolution that described the act as a \"crime against Muslim holy places\". Among its member states, Saudi Arabia severely condemned the act. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), home to large expatriate communities of Indians and Pakistanis, conveyed a more moderate reaction. In response, the Indian government criticised the GCC for what it regarded as interference in its internal affairs.[49] Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, condemned the demolition, and called upon India to do more to protect its Muslim population.[43] Although its government condemned the events, the UAE experienced severe public disturbances due to the demolition of the Babri Mosque.[50] Street protests broke out, and protesters threw stones at a Hindu temple and the Indian Consulate in Dubai.[50] In Al-Ain, 250 kilometres (160 mi) east of Abu Dhabi, angry mobs set fire to the girls' wing of an Indian school.[50] In response to the violence, UAE police arrested and deported many expatriate Pakistanis and Indians who had participated in the violence. The Commander-in-Chief of the Dubai Police Force, Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, condemned the violence by foreign nationals in the country.[50]\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nSeveral temples were attacked by Muslims in the UK, in what were suspected to be acts of revenge.[51] Attacks included petrol bombings and arson.[52] Hindu temples and Sikh gurdwaras, Hindu community centres and other cultural buildings were attacked. One temple was reportedly completely destroyed by fire.[53] Hindu and Muslim leaders appealed for peace following the attacks.[54]\n\n## In popular culture\n\nMalayalam author N. S. Madhavan's short story *Thiruthu* is based on the Babri Masjid demolition.[55] The Ayodhya dispute and the riots following the demolition form part of the backdrop to Antara Ganguly's 2016 novel, *Tanya Tania*.[56] *Lajja* (Shame), a 1993 novel by Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin, was partially inspired by the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh that intensified after the demolition of the Babri Masjid.[6]\n\nThe documentary *Ram ke Naam* (lit. 'In the name of Ram') by Anand Patwardhan examines the events preceding the demolition.[57] The Bollywood film *Mausam* (2011) is based on the events surrounding the demolition.[58] The riots that followed the demolition are an important part of the plot of several films, including *Bombay* (1995) set in the Bombay riots.[59] *Daivanamathil* (2005) explores the repercussions of the demolition on Muslims in Kerala.[60] Both *Bombay* and *Daivanamathi* won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration at the respective National Film Awards.[61][62] The 2007 film *Black Friday* was based on the 1993 Bombay bombings, which were considered to be a response to the demolition of the mosque.[63][64]\n\n## Notes\n\n**^**For opposing views, see Srivastava, Sushil (1991).*The Disputed Mosque: A Historical Inquiry*.

Until a local man intervened.*\n\n**Lahore, Pakistan** \u2013 The loud banging on the door was accompanied by chants.\n\n\u201cDeath to India,\u201d shouted the mob that had converged on the government-run school in the small town of Niaz Baig.\n\nIt was December 7, 1992, a crisp winter morning.\n\nThe day before, a mosque had been demolished in neighbouring India. The destruction of the 16th century Babri Mosque by Hindu nationalists had triggered riots that left 2,000 people \u2013 most of them Indian Muslims \u2013 dead.\n\nBut the fallout from that day would not remain within India\u2019s borders.\n\nIn protest against the destruction of the mosque, the government of Pakistan had declared December 7 a national holiday.\n\nSo, with the school\u2019s pupils off for the day, only the principal, some teachers and a few community members were present when the mob came knocking.\n\n## A school among the sprawl\n\nIt is a small detour from Lahore\u2019s well-kept, tree-lined Canal Road to the chaotic old town of Niaz Baig. But the contrast is stark.\n\nThe midday dust rises, first from the tarmac and then, as we venture deeper into the town, from the rubbish-lined dirt tracks.\n\nWe search for the school among the ill-planned sprawl of crumbling houses and, soon enough, find ourselves sitting inside it with its affable principal, Master Ashfaq, and Naseeb Khan, a former teacher who was there on that morning 27 years ago.\n\n1992 was Khan\u2019s first year teaching at the school. It is one the well-spoken teacher will not forget.\n\nA tall, domed structure with a faded Pakistani flag on top and faded floral frescoes on the ceiling, the school stands out among the poorly-constructed homes that surround it.\n\nThat is because, before its current incarnation as a school, it was the Bhadra Kali Hindu Mandir, a 19th-century Hindu temple dedicated to the Goddess Kali.\n\nAnd that is why the angry mob descended upon it that December morning.\n\n## From temple to mosque\n\nPart of a vast complex that included a traditional well, a holy pool and orchards, all surrounded by a thick boundary wall, Bhadra Kali Hindu Mandir was once one of the most prominent Hindu temples in Lahore.\n\nBut, like hundreds of others, it was abandoned in 1947 as British India was divided into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. The city of Lahore became part of Pakistan.\n\nThe new Pakistani state, struggling to accommodate the millions of refugees who had fled there in the bloody aftermath of Partition, allocated several Hindu and Sikh properties for them.\n\nNiaz Baig\u2019s temple was among them. Its orchards and sacred rooms became home to the Meo community, an ethnic group originally from Gurgaon in India who converted to Islam from Hinduism between the 12th and 17th centuries.\n\nBut for many years after Partition, the temple\u2019s main building was largely abandoned; used occasionally by members of the community for wedding ceremonies and sometimes taken over by drug users and illegal gamblers.\n\nUnhappy with how the sacred space was being used, in the 1970s a few members of the community decided to convert it into a mosque.\n\nThe man primarily responsible for this was Bashir Ahmad Meo.\n\n## \u2018We are all Pakistanis now\u2019\n\nBashir Ahmad Meo was a boy when he fled Gurgaon with his family during Partition. They arrived in Niaz Baig, where they found refuge in the temple\u2019s complex.\n\nAfter finishing school, he joined the Pakistan army and fought against India in the wars of 1965 and 1971.\n\nWhen he retired soon after the 1971 war, Meo returned to Niaz Baig.\n\nHe had a special affinity with the temple complex, explains Meo\u2019s 55-year-old son, Muhammad Mushtaq, who still lives in the area and talks proudly of his father. He would read all he could about its history, he adds.\n\nLater, Ashfaq shows us papers from a school council meeting in which Meo had recorded a detailed pre-Partition history of the building.\n\nThe army veteran became a self-appointed welfare officer for his community, helping people and animals in need, explains Mushtaq. He raised funds for widows, donated his land to establish the community\u2019s only veterinary clinic and provided financial support to many of the school\u2019s teachers.\n\nBut his particular concern was taking care of the temple.\n\n\u201cThis is a part of Pakistan now,\u201d Mushtaq recalls his father saying. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s for Hindus or Muslims, we are all Pakistanis now.\u201d\n\n## The land mafias\n\nBut, in this, Meo encountered an obstacle in the form of local land mafias who saw the vast space in the middle of an increasingly congested area as a money-making opportunity.\n\n\u201cYou know, as was the case with most temples and gurdwaras, the land mafia thought this, too, would be an easy target for them to take over,\u201d Mushtaq explains.\n\nMeo feared that they would succeed in their efforts unless he could find a way to make the community feel invested in the building.\n\nSo, along with some other members of the community, he decided to convert the temple into a mosque.\n\nThis is a part of Pakistan now. It doesn't matter if it's for Hindus or Muslims, we are all Pakistanis now.\n\n\nLeaving the sacred room dedicated to the goddess intact inside the temple, the local Muslim community began to gather there to offer their five daily prayers beside walls covered in frescoes of Hindu deities.\n\nMushtaq recalls his father telling him: \u201cWe must accept our history. When Pakistan was created, we took an oath to accept, protect and be proud of whatever we inherited as part of it.\u201d\n\nA little over two decades after Partition, when Hindus and Muslims had slit each other\u2019s throats in Lahore and elsewhere, the Muslim community of this small town prayed in a Hindu temple, maintaining its sanctity and protecting it from land mafias.\n\n## From mosque to school\n\nThen, in 1980, when the nearest school was flooded, Meo came up with another idea: The temple turned mosque should be converted again, this time into a primary school.\n\n\u201cThese are our kids,\u201d Mushtaq quotes his father. \u201cWe have a moral obligation to educate them, even if it is under the old banyan tree [by the entrance to the temple].\u201d\n\nA government school, Meo reasoned, would receive government protection.\n\nBut Meo\u2019s problems with the land mafia did not subside.\n\nAshfaq and Khan say that for years after the school was moved into the building, dead animals or blood-stained shrouds would appear in the courtyard overnight.\n\nThe land mafia, they explain, wanted to give the impression that the building was haunted so families would refuse to send their children there.\n\n\u201cThey tried everything under the sun to scare us away,\u201d says Khan. \u201cBut we would quietly go in and remove such signs before the children showed up in the mornings.\u201d\n\nMeo was determined that the school \u2013 and the temple building \u2013 would remain.\n\n## Babri Mosque\n\nThen, the Babri Mosque was demolished.\n\nPakistan\u2019s government under Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif watched passively as hundreds of mobs ransacked historical Hindu temples across the country and attacked members of the Hindu community. At least 24 people are thought to have been killed.\n\nIt was just such a mob that had gathered outside the school that morning.\n\nAshfaq and Khan insist it had come from Hanjarwal, a neighbouring town.\n\nMushtaq agrees.\u201dPeople here weren\u2019t bothered about the temple,\u201d he says. \u201cThey already knew this was a school. But the boys from Hanjarwal, we were later told, had planned to walk all the way here to bring down the structure.\u201d\n\nWe, the Muslims, too, were once a minority before the Partition. We should treat the minorities in the same way that we wanted ourselves to be treated then.\n\n\nMeo was at the school that morning as the mob knocked on the door.\n\nUnaware of what was happening to Hindu temples in other parts of the country, Meo and the teachers were caught by surprise.\n\n\u201cWe were all inside the school \u2026 when suddenly we heard a loud thud on the door and the sound of shovels beating against the boundary wall,\u201d recalls Mushtaq.\n\nThe mob had brought shovels, spades and trowels with them. The structure may have taken on several different identities during its history, but that day, all that mattered to them was its Hindu identity.\n\nAfter spending more than 20 years caring for the structure, Meo was not about to let anyone bring it down.\n\nBy then in his 50s, he confronted the 150-person strong mob, convinced that he could reason with them.\n\n\u201cMy father raised his hands,\u201d Mushtaq explains. \u201cHis old age and stature were enough to make the mob stop at the door.\u201d\n\nMushtaq says his father talked to the mob for about two hours, explaining that destroying the temple to avenge the Babri Mosque would be against the injunctions of Islam.\n\nGiving them the example of the Prophet Muhammad, who did not attack the property of any non-Muslim after the conquest of Mecca, Meo urged them to abandon their plans. He argued that now Pakistan had been created, it was their duty as Pakistanis to protect not just the Hindu community but also their places of worship.\n\n\u201cWe, the Muslims, too, were once a minority before the Partition,\u201d Mushtaq says his father told them. \u201cWe should treat the minorities in the same way that we wanted ourselves to be treated then. Even though there are no Hindus here, we still ought to grant them freedom to worship as fellow Pakistanis. Let\u2019s not avenge the martyrdom of Babri Mosque by making a bad example of ourselves.\u201d\n\nAccording to Khan, Meo told the mob that as the school catered to the poor children of the community, bringing it down would not only be a disservice to Islam but also to their futures.\n\nSections of the mob were unconvinced; they burned one of the temple\u2019s wooden doors and damaged part of its boundary wall. But most were persuaded and eventually turned away.\n\nThe temple had been saved.\n\nMeo died in 2018, at the age of 83. Mushtaq, Ashfaq and Khan say his legacy lives on in this temple turned school.\n\n\u201cMy father lived a truly selfless life. He devoted his time and energy towards others,\u201d says Mushtaq. \u201cWhat started as an abandoned Hindu building, worthless to many at the time, is now a school for over 400 students, shaping the future of, hopefully, a more inclusive Pakistan.\u201d","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_68f56e43fc6a4858b24b370d\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Bashir Ahmad Meo\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"Naseeb Khan\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"Muhammad Mushtaq\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"Master Ashfaq\\\\\\\" Babri Masjid\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: The Muslim who saved a Hindu temple from a mob in ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/features\/2019\/12\/6\/the-muslim-who-saved-a-hindu-temple-from-a-mob-in-pakistan\n...

It references:\n\n1. An American software entrepreneur\/philanthropist advocating for LGBTQ equality (Tim Gill)\n2. A South Asian country with colonial-era laws (India)\n3. An amendment integrating religious tenets into state laws\n4. Sectarian tension between two major denominations\n5. An extremist organization attacking a shrine\n6. A heroic local resident who intervened\n\nHowever, after extensive research using multiple search queries and examining relevant sources, I found that:\n\n1. **Tim Gill** is indeed an American software entrepreneur and philanthropist known for LGBTQ rights advocacy, and his foundation has supported LGBTQ causes globally, including in India.\n\n2. **India** fits the description of a South Asian country with colonial-era laws (Indian Penal Code) that have been amended, and there has been governmental efforts to integrate religious tenets into laws.\n\n3. **Babri Masjid demolition** fits the description of an extremist attack on a religious shrine, where Hindu nationalist mobs demolished the mosque in 1992, leading to widespread sectarian violence between Hindus and Muslims.\n\n4. **The critical issue**: Despite extensive searching through multiple sources about the Babri Masjid demolition, I found no credible evidence of any specific \"local resident\" being lauded for a courageous intervention during that particular event. The sources describe the demolition as a mob action where police failed to intervene, and while there are stories of individual acts of courage in various contexts related to this event, none specifically match the description of a heroic intervention during the shrine assault.\n\n5. **Alternative story found**: I did find a story about **Bashir Ahmad Meo**, a Muslim Pakistani man who intervened to save a Hindu temple from a mob in Pakistan following the Babri Masjid demolition, but this occurred in Pakistan, not during the original attack, and involves a different religious site.\n\nGiven the lack of specific evidence for a heroic local resident during the Babri Masjid demolition itself, and the absence of any other matching historical events that fit all the criteria in the question, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the specific question asked.\n\nThe question appears to be either:\n1.

The success of this treatment is highly dependent on parameters such as tissue electrical properties, applied voltages and spatial relations in placement of electrodes that are used to establish a cell-permeabilizing electric field in target tissue. Non-thermal irreversible electroporation techniques for ablation of tissue depend similarly on these parameters. In the treatment planning stage, if oversimplified approximations for evaluation of electric field are used, such as U\/d (voltage-to-distance ratio), sufficient field strength may not be reached within the entire target (tumor) area, potentially resulting in treatment failure.\n\n### Results\n\nIn order to provide an aid in education of medical personnel performing electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation, assist in visualizing the electric field in needle electrode electroporation and the effects of changes in electrode placement, an application has been developed both as a desktop- and a web-based solution. It enables users to position up to twelve electrodes in a plane of adjustable dimensions representing a two-dimensional slice of tissue. By means of manipulation of electrode placement, i.e. repositioning, and the changes in electrical parameters, the users interact with the system and observe the resulting electrical field strength established by the inserted electrodes in real time. The field strength is calculated and visualized online and instantaneously reflects the desired changes, dramatically improving the user friendliness and educational value, especially compared to approaches utilizing general-purpose numerical modeling software, such as finite element modeling packages.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we outline the need and offer a solution in medical education in the field of electroporation-based treatments, e.g. primarily electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible tissue ablation. We present the background, the means of implementation and the fully functional application, which is the first of its kind. While the initial feedback from students that have evaluated this application as part of an e-learning course is positive, a formal study is planned to thoroughly evaluate the current version and identify possible future improvements and modifications.\n\n**Keywords:** Education on electroporation, Electromagnetic field visualization, Applications in subject areas, Interdisciplinary projects, Interactive learning environments\n\n## Background\n\n### Electroporation\n\nElectroporation is a term coined in the early 1980's [1] for phenomena already described more than a decade earlier [2], when an interesting property of biological membranes has been observed. Electroporation mainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly composed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short and intense electric fields. The physical mechanism responsible for increased permeability is thought to be the formation of nano-scale defects termed *pores* (thus electro*poration*) in the lipid structure [3,4]. This allows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact mechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is too high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not temporary, but instead result in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversible electroporation. On the other hand, if the cells survive, increased permeability of membrane is only temporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible electroporation. This observed transient increase in permeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of applications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA) delivery, introduction of drugs into cells, fusion of cells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer, gene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of drugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6,7] for an overview. In these applications viability of the porated cells is important and thus irreversible electroporation is consciously avoided and generally considered to be an undesired side effect. However, there are also interesting medical applications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering the domains of industrial [9,10] and environmental [11] applications.\n\n### Electrochemotherapy\n\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that successfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs. For successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate amplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and shape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake and hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been identified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13,14]. The transport of bleomycin across the nonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited [15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and DNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity of bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several thousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is the electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent increase in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to reach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17,18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be eradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be permeabilized, i.e. all cells in the tumor have to be exposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means that the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends on both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high electric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we must consider before we can confidently assume we have successfully electroporated the entire tumor area. First, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue electrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity compared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric field strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields in the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue of electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their shape, size and position. In general, there are two types of electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate electrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with either a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two plates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively, which ensures good electrical contact, but has other drawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure good electrical contact and optimal distance between electrodes to fit the tumor [21,22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous and dependent on their diameter, distance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013 the task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even more arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19,24] and in vivo studies [25] on importance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need for careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted by a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) project, in the scope of which standard operating procedures for ECT were published [26]. However, in advanced cases such as intracranial [27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need for patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29,30].\n\n### Non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation and other techniques\n\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation. While the high number of applied pulses used to achieve classical irreversible electroporation may also cause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the current-conducting tissue, non-thermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since it results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and no protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical applications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is technically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of chemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison to other ablation methods such as RF ablation or cryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the connective structure [8,32]. Since it has been observed that NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves, there is hope of using this technique in treatment of tumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as this treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of ECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure adequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other minimally invasive therapies for treatment of deep-seated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g. high intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation. The latter is a minimally invasive procedure where a needle electrode is inserted percutaneously into a tumor, much as in ECT or NTIRE. The electrode acts as an antenna for electromagnetic waves emitted by a generator; the tumor is heated up and thereby destroyed [34]. As with NTIRE or ECT, the need for accurate needle placement exists and its importance has been evaluated. Success, i.e. improved treatment, has been proven to be correlated to the experience of the operator [34].\n\n### The need for education on electroporation\n\nAs outlined in the paragraphs above, both reversible and irreversible electroporation are promising approaches in treating solid tumors, however their success is highly dependent on local field strength. Poorly defined or unknown properties such as tissue conductivities and inhomogeneities in addition to our choice of electrode type, positions and pulse amplitudes, affect the electric field distribution. With many factors to take into consideration, we may dismiss important uncontrolled variables or use a well-studied but irrelevant model that cannot be applied to a specific situation. An example of this is the persistent use of a very simple approximation for electric field strength that holds only under very particular conditions. This frequently used approximation equates the electric field strength *E* to the voltage *U* applied on the electrodes divided by the distance *d* between the electrodes, i.e. *E* \u2248 *U*\/*d*. Since the local electric field strength has been identified as the key factor in achieving both reversible and irreversible electroporation (see [19] for details), i.e. local *E* has to reach a certain threshold value *E*rev or *E*irrev, it is the parameter we most often optimize our electrode configuration for. There is a problem, however, since this simple relation is strictly valid only in an isotropic homogeneous medium between two infinitely large parallel plate electrodes. When using parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this simple model best approximates the actual field strength far from the electrode edges, provided the electrode width is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results are even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of course there are no parallel plates to speak of (see Figure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore, using the simple parallel plate approximation for *E* in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result in significant reduction of response in treatment for which the complete response rate has been shown to be as high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way into more and more clinics worldwide [36-39] and establishing themselves as safe and effective treatments of cancer, it is becoming more and more important that medical personnel performing and planning ECT (or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action, the underlying physics and possible pitfalls. This paper presents an application for visualization and analysis of the electric field strength in multiple-needle-electrode electroporation aimed at users with basic knowledge of the principles of electroporation, but lack of education in physics and engineering who may therefore need visual, interactive and didactic instruments to gain a deeper understanding of the principles necessary for effective use of these promising treatments. Since educational applications of the sort are scarce and research is focused primarily on advancing the field rather than educating, the need to explore options and applications in this area of engineering education seems pressing and applicative results should be welcome. The application is part of a now firmly established annual course Electroporation Based Technologies and Treatments, EBTT (http:\/\/www.ebtt.org). The e-learning laboratory exercise into which the presented application has been incorporated, has been developed and described previously [40].\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Theoretical background\n\nThe theoretical background for the mathematical engine that is at the heart of our application has been derived from the electrostatic field theory, more specifically, extended from a solution for electrostatic potential generated by two long parallel charged conductors given in [41]. We have omitted the detailed mathematical derivations here as they are outside the scope of this paper; however, we have included a derivation of the equations below in the Appendix for those readers that may be interested in further development or modifications to our model. Below, we specify only the final formulation of the mathematical model and the method of application of this analytical solution into the field-calculating engine that represents the core of Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation (ApiVizTEP), since this is the only essential part of the application around which the user interface is built. Similarly to the approach that we present in this paper, other analytical models have been developed previously using complex analysis. For a six-needle array, one may find a first-order analytical approximation for the electric field strength in [42]. Other authors have expanded on this approach further, see e.g. [43] and [44]; however, these solutions do not give an accurate analytical expression for the electric field strength since quite possibly such a solution cannot be obtained for three or more electrodes active concurrently at a given time. Since currently electroporation devices mostly power only one pair of electrodes at a time [45], we have not pursued a solution with more than two concurrently active electrodes, thus avoiding the derivation of an approximate solution. Instead, we give an accurate solution for a two needle electrode system that is not based (mathematically) on previously published work.\n\nThe accurate analytical solution for electric field strength of two long parallel cylindrical conductors (needle electrodes) on a plane perpendicular to the conductor longitudinal axis (2-D solution), is given by the following equation\n\n*V*AB is the voltage on an electrode pair (anode\u2013cathode), *d*AB is the distance between the electrodes, *\u03c1*0 is the electrode diameter, while *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B are coordinates of the center of the electrode mathematical equivalents (the electrical center *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B of the electrodes is eccentric to the actual geometrical center *x*A, *y*A and *x*B, *y*B due to finite i.e. non-zero electrode diameter).\n\nOur application employs a mesh of 400 \u00d7 400 points and the electric field strength *E* is calculated for each of the 160.000 points using the expression above. The time needed to perform the necessary calculations and display the results is practically negligible, ranging from a few hundred milliseconds for two active electrodes up to one and a half seconds for twelve active electrodes using an average modern personal computer, i.e. at least a dual core 2 GHz processor equipped with 2 GB of memory or more. It needs to be emphasized that while the application allows for inclusion of up to twelve electrodes distributed into one to six groups with variable voltages, the application fundamentally breaks down these groups into anode\u2013cathode pairs and calculates the electric field strength by means of the equations above for every pair. It then searches this set of results to obtain the maximum value of the electric field in each of the 160.000 points. This value represents the final solution in that point, since what we are interested in is determining the maximum value for the local field strength. In this way we have eliminated the need for a solution for the electric field of more than two concurrently active electrodes. Such an approach is justified by the fact that we have already mentioned \u2013 i.e. currently electroporation devices only power two electrodes at the same time.\n\n### Tools and platforms\n\nThe application has been written in C# programming language in the Microsoft\u00ae Visual Studio 2010 integrated development environment. The library used was the Microsoft\u00ae .NET Framework version 4. The development environment and base library have both been selected based on personal preference and possibilities that are enabled by the enhancements in these tools concerning ease of graphical user interface (GUI) development by separating the markup that describes the GUI elements from programming logic that provides the functionality.\n\nThe internet version of the application is hosted on a semi-open platform, since a Microsoft\u00ae Windows operating system is hosting an Apache\u2122 HTTP Server web server with installed PHP support and a free edition of Oracle\u00ae MySQL, providing a web interface to basically the same, though slightly modified and recompiled, engine as in the desktop version.\n\n## Results\n\nThe application that we developed has been named Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation, or ApiVizTEP in short. It is a Microsoft .NET application bundled into an installation package together with the .NET Framework version 4 Client Profile redistributable installation, which enables the user to install the application locally, provided the machine hardware and operating system support this prerequisite framework, as do most modern Windows operating systems installed on compatible hardware.\n\nAt the start the application presents itself with a navigational panel on the left-hand side of the window and a help panel to the right (see Figure 2).\n\nThe help panel contains instructions on locating the configuration of the system, i.e. directs to the *config* and *settings* panels. These contain various model and system settings that we describe here briefly: It is possible to include from two up to twelve needle e\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_f1f11bba0d8e4a1180937151\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Educational application for visualization and analysis of electric field strength in multiple electrode electroporation\\\\\\\" authors Slovenia Faculty Electrical Engineering\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Educational application for visualization and analysis of ...\nURL: https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC3528424\/\nby S Mahni\u010d-Kalamiza \u00b7 2012 \u00b7 Cited by 57 \u2014 Educational application for visualization and analysis of electric field strength in multiple electrode electroporation.

These bands often release Japanese versions of their songs, giving them \"two language versions\" (Korean and Japanese).\n\n## Step 2: Entertainment firm on KOSDAQ\n\nFNC Entertainment is listed on KOSDAQ (Korea Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) under the ticker symbol 173940.KQ.\n\n## Step 3: KOSDAQ benchmarked against NASDAQ\n\nKOSDAQ was designed to be similar to NASDAQ, both being electronic stock markets focused on technology companies.

The challenge is to be able to link materials behavior and seek patterns among multiple length and time scales. Materials informatics and statistical learning techniques permit one to survey complex, multiscale information in an accelerated and statistically robust and yet meaningful manner. When this is coupled with advanced tools for computational thermodynamics and kinetic simulations, the result is a powerful computational infrastructure for materials design. This paper provides an overview of the value of this integrated approach to materials modeling in addressing the challenges in linking length scales.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nZ.-K.

The feasible region (the region where probabilities do not decay exponentially with time) grows linearly with time, as is the case with one-dimensional QRW. The limiting shape of the feasible region is, however, quite different. The limit region turns out to be an algebraic set, which we characterize as the rational image of a compact algebraic variety. We also compute the probability profile within the limit region, which is essentially a negative power of the Gaussian curvature of the same algebraic variety. Our methods are based on analysis of the space-time generating function, following the methods of Pemantle and Wilson (J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

The Hamiltonian is space- and time-invariant. The allowed\ntransitions at each time are a \ufb01nite set of integer translations. In addition to location, the particle\npossesses an internal state (the chirality), which is necessary to make the evolution of the location\nnondeterministic. A rigorous mathematical analysis of this system in one dimension was \ufb01rst given\nby [ABN+01]. The particle moves ballistically, meaning that at time n, its distance from the origin\nis likely to be of order n. By contrast, the classical random walk moves di\ufb00usively, being localized\nto an interval of size\n\nn at time n.\n\n\u221a\n\nA very similar process may be de\ufb01ned in higher dimensions.\n\nIn particular, given a subset\nE \u2282 Zd with cardinality k and a k \u00d7 k unitary matrix U , there is a corresponding space- and\ntime-homogeneous QRW in which allowed transitions are translations by elements of E and evolution of chirality is governed by U . When E is the set of signed standard basis vectors we\ncall this a nearest neighbor QRW; for example in two dimensions, a nearest neighbor walk has\nE = {(0, 1), (0, \u22121), (1, 0), (\u22121, 0)}; a complete construction of quantum random walk is given in\nSection 2.1 below. Published work on quantum random walk in dimensions two and higher began\naround 2002 (see [MBSS02]). Most studies, including the most recent and broad study [WKKK08],\nare concerned to a great extent with localization; this phenomenon is not generic in quantum random walk models and not present in the models we discuss below. The analyses we have seen\nrange from analytic derivations without complete proofs to numerical studies. As far as we know,\nno rigorous analysis of two-dimensional QRW has been published. The question of describing the\nbehavior of two-dimensional QRW was brought to our attention by Cris Moore (personal communication). In the present paper, we answer this question by proving theorems about the limiting\nshape of the feasible region (the region where probaiblities do not decay exponentially with time) for\ntwo-dimensional QRW, and by giving asymptotically valid formulae for the probability amplitudes\nat speci\ufb01c locations within this region.\n\nOur analyses begin with the space-time generating function. This is a multivariate rational\nfunction which may be derived without too much di\ufb03culty. The companion paper [BP07] introduces\nthis approach and applies it to an arbitrary one-dimensional QRW with two chiralities (k = 2). This\napproach allows one to obtain detailed asymptotics such as an Airy-type limit in a scaling window\nnear the endpoints. As such, it improves on the analysis of [ABN+01] but not on the more recent\nand very nice analysis of [CIR03]. In one dimension, when the number of chiralities exceeds two,\nN. Konno [Kon05] found new behavior that is qualitatively di\ufb00erent from the two-chirality QRW.\nForthcoming work of the last author with T. Greenwood uses the generating function approach\nto greatly extend Konno\u2019s \ufb01ndings. The generating function approach, however, pays its greatest\ndividends in dimension two and higher. This approach is based on recent results on asymptotics\nof multivariate rational generating functions that allow nearly automatic transfer from rational\n\n1\n\n\n\n---\n\ngenerating functions to asymptotic formulae for their coe\ufb03cients [PW02; PW04; PW08; BP08].\nBased on these results, analyses of any instance of a two-dimensional QRW becomes relatively\n\n(a) limit\n\n(b) Exact probabilities at time 200\n\nFigure 1: Fixed-time empirical plot versus theoretical limit\n\neasy, although in some cases new versions of the results under weaker hypotheses were required.\nEmpirically computed probability pro\ufb01les such as are shown in \ufb01gure 1b are explained by algebraic\ncomputations, leading to limit shapes as shown in \ufb01gure 1a. We computed probability pro\ufb01les for a\nnumber of instances of two-dimensional QRW. The pictures, which appear scattered throughout the\npaper, are quite varied. Not only did we \ufb01nd these pictures visually intriguing, but they pointed us\ntoward some re\ufb01nements of the theoretical work in [PW02], which we now describe, beginning with\na more detailed description of the two plots.\n\nOn the right is depicted the probability distribution for the location of a particle after 200 steps\nof a quantum random walk on the planar integer lattice; the particular instance of QRW is a nearest\n\n2\n\n\n\n---\n\nneighbor walk (E = {(0, 1), (0, \u22121), (1, 0), (\u22121, 0)}) whose unitary matrix is discussed in Section 4.\nGreater probabilities are shown as darker shades of grey. The feasible region, where probabilities are\nnot extremely close to zero, is the diamond with vertices at the midpoints of the 400 \u00d7 400 square.\nThe feasible region appears to be a slightly rounded diamond.\n\nIn his Masters Thesis, the second author computed an asymptotically valid formula for the\nprobability amplitudes associated with some instances of QRW. As n \u2192 \u221e, the probabilities become\nexponentially small outside of a certain algebraic set \u039e, but are \u0398(n\u22122) inside of \u039e. Theorem 4.5\nof [Bra07] proves such a shape result for a di\ufb00erent instance of two-dimensional QRW and conjectures\nit for this one, giving the believed characterization of \u039e as an algebraic set. The plot in \ufb01gure 1a\nis a picture of this characterization, constructed by parametrizing \u039e by patches in the \ufb02at torus\nT0 := (R\/2\u03c0Z)2 and then depicting the patches by showing the image of a grid embedded in the\ntorus.\n\nWhen the plot was constructed, it was intended only to exhibit the overall shape. Nevertheless,\nit is visually obvious that signi\ufb01cant internal structure is duplicated as well. Identical dark regions\nin the shape of a Maltese cross appear inside each of the two \ufb01gures. To explain this, we consider\nthe map \u03a6 : T \u2192 R2 whose image produces the region \u039e. Let V denote the pole variety of the\ngenerating function F for a given QRW, that is, the complex algebraic hypersurface on which the\ndenominator H of F vanishes. Let V1 denote the intersection of V with the unit torus T. It is easy\nto solve for the third coordinate z as a local function of x and y on V1 and thereby obtain a piecewise\nparametrization\n\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) 7\u2192\n\n(cid:16)\n\nei\u03b1, ei\u03b2, ei\u03c6(\u03b1,\u03b2)(cid:17)\n\nof V1 by patches in R2. Theorem 3.3 extends the results of [PW02] to show that each point z of V1\nproduces a polynomially decaying contribution to the probaiblity pro\ufb01le for movement at velocity\n(r, s) which is the image of z under the logarithmic Gauss map n of the surface V1 at z:\n\nn(z) :=\n\n(cid:18)\n\nx\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202x\n\n, y\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202y\n\n, z\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202z\n\n(cid:19)\n\n.\n\nFormally, n maps into the projective space RP2, but we map this to R2 by taking the projection\nIn other words, the plot is the image of the grid (Z\/100Z)2 under the\n\u03c0(r, s, t) := (r\/t, s\/t, 1).\nfollowing composition of maps:\n\n(Z\/100Z)2 \u03b9\u2212\u2192 S1 \u00d7 S1 (1,1,\u03c6)\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 V n\u2212\u2192 RP2 \u03c0\u2212\u2192 R2 .\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe intensity of an image of a uniform grid of dots is proportional to the inverse of the Jacobian\nof the mapping. The Jacobian of the composition is the product of the Jacobians of the factors,\nthe most signi\ufb01cant factor being the Gauss map, n.\nIts Jacobian is just the Gaussian curvature\n(in logarithmic coordinates). The darkest regions therefore correspond to the places where the\ncurvature of log V1 vanishes. Alignment of this picture with the empirical amplitudes can only\nmean that the formulae for asymptotics of generating functions given in [PW02] blow up when the\n\n3\n\n\n\n---\n\nGaussian curvature of log V1 vanishes. This observation allowed us to produce new expressions for\nthe quantities in the conclusions of theorems in [PW02], where lengthy polynomials were replaced\nby quantities involving Gaussian curvatures.\n\nTo summarize, the purpose of this paper is twofold:\n\n1. In Theorem 4.9, we prove the shape conjecture from [Bra07]; further instances of this are\n\nproved in Theorems 4.2 and 4.7.\n\n2. In Theorems 3.3 and 3.5 we reformulate the main result in [PW02] to clarify the relation\nbetween the asymptotics of a multivariate rational generating function and the curvature of\nthe pole variety in logarithmic coordinates.\n\nThe organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives some background on\nquantum random walks, notions of Gaussian curvature, amoebas of Laurent polynomials, the multivariate Cauchy formula, and certain standard applications of the stationary phase method to the\nevaluation of oscillating integrals. Section 3 contains general results on rational multivariate asymptotics that will be used in the derivation of the QRW limit theorems. In particular, Theorem 3.3\ngives a new formulation of the main result of [PW02], while Theorem 3.5 proves a version of these\nresults in situations where the geometry of V1 is more complicated than can be handled by the methods of [PW02]. Finally, Section 4 applies these results to a collection of instances of two-dimensional\nnearest neighbor QRW in which the unitary matrices are elements of one-parameter families named\nS(p), A(p) and B(p), 0 < p < 1. This results in Theorems 4.2, 4.7 and 4.9 respectively. The QRW\nin \ufb01gure 1 has unitary matrix B(1\/2), while the following \ufb01gures show examples of the S(1\/2) and\nA(5\/9) quantum random walks.\n\n(a) limit\n\n(b) probabilities at time 200\n\nFigure 2: the S(1\/2) QRW\n\n4\n\n\n\n---\n\n(a) limit\n\n(b) probabilities at time 200\n\nFigure 3: the A(5\/9) QRW\n\n5\n\n\n\n---\n\n2 Preliminaries\n\n2.1 Quantum random walks\n\nThe quantum random walk is a model for the motion of a single quantum particle evolving in Zd\nunder a time and translation invariant Hamiltonian for which the probability pro\ufb01le of a particle\nafter one time step, started from a known location, is uniform on the neighbors. Such a process was\n\ufb01rst constructed in [ADZ93]. Let d \u2265 1 be the spatial dimension. Let E = {v(1), . . . , v(k)} \u2286 Zd be\na set of \ufb01nite cardinality k. Let U be a unitary matrix of size k. The set Zd \u00d7 E indexes the set\nof pure states of the QRW with parameters k, E and U . Let Id \u2297 U denote the operator that sends\n(r, v(j)) to (r, U v(j)), that is, it leaves the location unchanged but operates on the chirality by U .\nLet \u03c3 denote the operator that sends (r, v(j)) to (r + v(j), v(j)), that is, it translates the location\naccording to the chirality and does not change the chirality. The product \u03c3 \u00b7 (Id \u2297 U ) is the operator\nwe call QRW with parameters k, E and U . Let us denote this by Q.\n\nFor 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k and r \u2208 Zk,\n\n\u03c8(i,j)\nn\n\nr := he0,i|Qn|er,ji\n\ndenotes the amplitude at time n for a particle starting at location 0 in chirality i to be in location\nr and chirality j. Let z denote (z1, . . . , zd+1) and de\ufb01ne\n\nF (i,j)(z) :=\n\nX\n\nn,r\n\n\u03c8(i,j)\nn\n\n(r)zr1\n\n1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 zrd\n\nd zn\n\nd+1\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhich denotes the spacetime generating function for n-step transitions from chirality i to chirality\nj and all locations. Let F(z) denote the matrix (F (i,j))1\u2264i,j\u2264k. Let M denote the diagonal matrix\nwhose entries are the monomials {zr : r \u2208 E}. When d = 2 we use (x, y, z) for (z1, z2, z3) and (r, s)\nfor r; for a two-dimensional nearest neighbor QRW, therefore, the notation becomes\n\nand\n\nF (i,j)(x, y, z) =\n\nX\n\nn,r,s\n\n\u03c8(i,j)\nn\n\n(r, s)xryszn\n\nM =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nx\n0\n0 x\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n0\n0\ny\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\ny\u22121\n\nAn explicit expression for F may be derived via an elementary enumerative technique known as\nthe transfer matrix method [Sta97; GJ83]. For d = 1 and a particular choice of U (the Hadamard\nmatrix), this rational function is computed in [ABN+01]. In [BP07, Section 3], the following formula\nis given for the matrix generating function F:\n\nF(z) = (I \u2212 zd+1M U )\u22121 .\n\n(2.2)\n\n6\n\n\n\n---\n\nThe (i, j)-entry of the matrix, F (i,j), may therefore be written as a rational function G\/H where\n\nH = det(I \u2212 zd+1M U ) .\n\nThe following result is easy but crucial. It is valid in any dimension d \u2265 1. Let Td denote the unit\ntorus in Cd.\n\nProposition 2.1 (torality). The denominator H of the spacetime generating function for a quantum\nrandom walk has the property that\n\n(z1, . . . , zd) \u2208 Td and H(z) = 0 =\u21d2 |zd+1| = 1 .\n\n(2.3)\n\nProof: If (z1, . . . , zd) \u2208 Td then M is unitary, hence M U is unitary. The zeros of det(I \u2212 zd+1M U )\nare the reciprocals of eigenvalues of M U , which are therefore complex numbers of unit modulus. (cid:3)\n\nProposition 2.2. Let H be any polynomial and let V denote the pole variety, namely the set\n{z : H(z) = 0}. Let V1 := V \u2229 Td+1. Assume the torality hypothesis (2.3). Let p \u2208 V1 be any point\nfor which \u2207H(p) 6= 0. Then V1 is a smooth d-dimensional manifold in a neighborhood of p.\n\nProof: We will show that \u2202H\/\u2202zd+1(p) 6= 0. It follows by the implicit function theorem that there\nis an analytic function g : Cd \u2192 C such that for z in some neighborhood of p, H(z) = 0 if and only\nif zd+1 = g(z1, . . . , zd)). Restricting (z1, . . . , zd) to the unit torus, the torality hypothesis implies\nzd+1 = 1, whence V1 is locally the graph of a smooth function.\n\nTo see that \u2202H\/\u2202zd+1(p) 6= 0, \ufb01rst change coordinates to zj = pj exp(i\u03b8j) and zd+1 = pd+1 exp(i\u03c3).\nLetting \u02dcH := H \u25e6 exp, the new torality hypothesis is (\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8d) \u2208 Rd and H(\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8d, \u03c3) = 0 implies \u03c3 \u2208 R. We are given \u2207 \u02dcH(0) 6= 0 and are trying to show that \u2202 \u02dcH\/\u2202\u03c3(0) 6= 0.\n\nConsider \ufb01rst the case d = 1 and let \u03b8 := \u03b81. Assume for contradiction that \u2202 \u02dcH\/\u2202\u03c3(0, 0) =\n0 6= \u2202 \u02dcH\/\u2202\u03b8(0, 0). Let \u02dcH(\u03b8, \u03c3) = P\nj,k\u22650 bj,k\u03b8j\u03c3k be a series expansion for \u02dcH in a neighborhood of\n(0, 0). We have b0,0 = 0 6= b1,0. Let \u2018 be the least positive integer for which the b0,\u2018 6= 0; such an\ninteger exists (otherwise \u02dcH(0, \u03c3) \u2261 0, contradicting the new torality hypothesis) and is at least 2 by\nthe vanishing of \u2202H\/\u2202\u03c3(0, 0). Then there is a Puiseux expansion for the curve { \u02dcH = 0} for which\n\u03c3 \u223c (b1,0\u03b8\/b0,\u2018)1\/\u2018. This follows from [BK86] although it is quite elementary in this case: as \u03c3, \u03b8 \u2192 0,\nthe power series without the (1, 0) and (0, \u2018) terms sums to O(|\u03b8|2 + |\u03b8\u03c3| + |\u03c3|\u2018+1) = o(|\u03b8| + |\u03c3|\u2018) (use\nH\u00a8older\u2019s inequality); in order for \u02dcH to vanish, one must therefore have b1,0\u03b8 + b0,\u2018\u03c3\u2018 = o(|\u03b8| + |\u03c3|\u2018),\nfrom which \u03c3 \u223c (b1,0\u03b8\/b0,\u2018)1\/\u2018 follows. The only way the new torality hypothesis can now be satis\ufb01ed\nis if \u2018 = 2 and b1,0\u03b8\/b0,\u2018 is always positive; but \u03b8 may take either sign, so we have a contradiction.\n\nFinally, if d > 1, again we must have b0,...,0,\u2018 6= 0 in order to avoid \u02dcH(0, . . . , 0, \u03c3) \u2261 0. Let r \u2208 Rd\nbe any vector not orthogonal to \u2207 \u02dcH(0) and let G(\u03b8, \u03c3) := \u02dcH(r1\u03b8, . . . , rd\u03b8, \u03c3). Then \u2202G\/\u2202\u03b8(0, 0) 6=\n0 = \u2202G\/\u2202\u03c3(0, 0) and the new torality hypothesis holds for G; a contradiction then results from the\n(cid:3)\nabove analysis for the case d = 1.\n\n7\n\n\n\n---\n\nA Hadamard matrix is one whose entries are all \u00b11. There is more than one rank-4 unitary matrix that is a constant multiple of a Hadamard matrix, but for some reason the \u201cstandard\nHadamard\u201d QRW in two dimensions is the QRW whose unitary matrix is\n\nUHad :=\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n2\n\n1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121\n1 \u22121 \u22121\n\u22121\n1 \u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\n1\n\u22121 \u22121 \u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\nThis is referred to by Konno [IKK04; WKKK08] as the \u201cGrover walk\u201d because of its relation to the\nquantum search algorithm of L. Grover. Shown in \ufb01gure 4a is a plot of the probability pro\ufb01le for the\nposition of a particle performing a standard Hadamard QRW for 200 time steps. This is the only\ntwo-dimensional QRW we are aware of for which even a nonrigorous analysis had previously been\ncarried out. On the right, in \ufb01gure 4b, is the analogous plot of the region of non-exponential decay.\n\n(a) limit\n\n(b) exact probabilities at time 200\n\nFigure 4: Moore\u2019s Hadamard QRW\n\nAnother 4\u00d74 unitary Hadamard matrix re\ufb02ects the symmetries of (Z\/(2Z))2 rather than Z\/(4Z):\n\n\u02dcUHad :=\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u22121\n1 \u22121\n1 \u22121 \u22121\n1\n\u22121 \u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nThis matrix also goes by the name of S(1\/2) and is a member of the \ufb01rst family of QRW that we will\nanalyze. There is no reason to stick with Hadamard matrices. Varying U further produces a number\nof other probability pro\ufb01les including the families S(p), A(p) and B(p) analyzed in Section 4.\n\n2.2 Di\ufb00erential Geometry\n\nFor a smooth orientable hypersurface V \u2282 Rd+1, the Gauss map n sends each point p \u2208 V to a\nconsistent choice of normal vector. We may identify n(p) with an element of Sd. For a given patch\n\n8\n\n\n\n---\n\nP \u2282 V containing p, let n[P ] := \u222aq\u2208P n(q), and denote the area of a patch P in either V or Sd as\nA[P ]. Then the Gauss-Kronecker curvature of V at p is de\ufb01ned as\n\nK := lim\nP \u2192p\n\nA(n[P ])\nA[P ]\n\n.\n\n(2.4)\n\nWhen d is odd, the antipodal map on Sd has determinant \u22121, whence the particular choice of unit\nnormal will in\ufb02uence the sign of K, which is therefore only well de\ufb01ned up to sign. When d is\neven, we take the numerator to be negative if the map n is orientation reversing and we have a\nwell de\ufb01ned signed quantity. Clearly, K is equal to the Jacobian of the Gauss map at the point p.\nFor computational purposes, it is convenient to have a formula for the curvature of the graph of a\nfunction from Rd to R.\n\nProposition 2.3. Suppose that in a neighborhood of the point p, the smooth hypersurface V \u2286 Rd+1\nis the graph of a function h mapping the origin to p; that is, in some neighborhood of the origin,\n\nV = {(x, \u03c4 ) : \u03c4 = h(x)}. Let \u2207 := \u2207h(0) and H := det\n\n(0)\n\ndenote respectively the\n\n(cid:18) \u2202h\n\n(cid:19)\n\n\u2202ui\u2202uj\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264d\n\ngradient and Hessian determinant of h at the origin. Then the curvature of V at the origin is given\nby\n\np1 + |\u2207|2\nThe square root is taken to be positive and in case d is odd, the curvature is with respect to a unit\nnormal in the direction in which the dependent variable increases.\n\nK =\n\nH\n\n2+d .\n\nProof: Let X : U \u2286 Rd \u2192 Rd+1 denote the parametrizing map de\ufb01ned by\n\nX(u) := (u1, . . . , ud, h(u1, . . . , ud))\n\non a neighborhood U of the origin. Let \u03c0 be the restriction to V of projection of Rd+1 onto the \ufb01rst\nd coordinates, so \u03c0 inverts X on U . De\ufb01ne a vector\n\nN(u) :=\n\n(cid:18) \u2202h\n\u2202u1\n\n, . . . ,\n\n(cid:19)\n\n, \u22121\n\n\u2202h\n\u2202ud\n\nnormal to V at X(u) and let \u02c6N denote the corresponding unit normal N\/|N|. Observe that |N| =\np1 + |\u2207h|2, and in particular, that |N(0)| = p1 + |\u2207|2. The Jacobian of \u03c0 at the point p is, up to\nsign, the cosine of the angle between the zd+1 axis and the normal to the tangent plane to V at p.\nThus\n\n|J(\u03c0(p))| =\n\n| \u02c6N \u00b7 ed+1|\n| \u02c6N||ed+1|\n\n=\n\n1\/|N(0)|\n1 \u00b7 1\n\n=\n\n1\np1 + |\u2207|2\n\n.\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe Gaussian curvature at the point p is, by de\ufb01nition, the Jacobian of the map \u02c6N \u25e6 \u03c0 at p.\n\nUsing J to denote the Jacobian, write \u02c6N as | \u00b7 | \u25e6 N and apply the chain rule to see that\n\nK = J(\u03c0(p)) \u00b7 J(N)(0) \u00b7 J(| \u00b7 | )(N(0)) =\n\n1\np1 + |\u2207|2\n\n\u00b7 J(N)(0) \u00b7 J(| \u00b7 | )(\u2207, \u22121) .\n\n(2.6)\n\n9\n\n\n\n---\n\nHere, |\u00b7| is considered as a map from Rd \u00d7{\u22121} to Sd; at the p\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_b28e92f59e634cd19b86955f\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Robin Pemantle\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Sloan Fellowship\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"Packard Fellowship\\\\\\\" combinatorics\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Robin Pemantle - Simons Foundation\nURL: https:\/\/www.simonsfoundation.org\/people\/robin-pemantle\/\nRobin Pemantle on Simons Foundation. ...

Pascal made many contributions to probability theory, including many through his interactions with Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665).\nQ: What is the probability method in combinatorics?\nA: Summary. The 'probabilistic method' is a fundamental tool in combinatorics. The basic idea is as follows: to prove that an object (for example, graph) with certain properties exists, it suffices to prove that if the object is chosen at random, then it has the desired properties with positive probability.\nQ: Is combinatorics used in probability?\nA: Combinatorics is well known for the breadth of the problems it tackles. Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in algebra, probability theory, topology, and geometry, as well as in its many application areas.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Based on my step-by-step analysis using the provided tools, I have identified the exact paper that matches all the detailed criteria provided:\n\n1. **2011 paper published in a statistical physics journal**: \u2713 Published in Journal of Statistical Physics (2011)\n\n2. **Analysis of quantum probability distributions spreading across a plane**: \u2713 Two-dimensional quantum random walk\n\n3. **Focus on 'feasible region' and its limiting shape linked to algebraic geometry**: \u2713 The paper discusses the feasible region where probabilities do not decay exponentially, and proves the limiting shape is an algebraic set\n\n4. **Methods based on generating functions, echoing approaches of a probability expert at an Ivy League university in Philadelphia**: \u2713 The paper follows methods of Pemantle and Wilson, and Robin Pemantle is at University of Pennsylvania (Ivy League in Philadelphia), known for combinatorics and probability work\n\n5. **Probability expert with fellowships including one named after a mathematician and hedge fund founder**: \u2713 Robin Pemantle has held a Sloan Fellowship (named after Alfred P.

The feasible region (the region where probabilities do not decay exponentially with time) grows linearly with time, as is the case with one-dimensional QRW. The limiting shape of the feasible region is, however, quite different. The limit region turns out to be an algebraic set, which we characterize as the rational image of a compact algebraic variety. We also compute the probability profile within the limit region, which is essentially a negative power of the Gaussian curvature of the same algebraic variety. Our methods are based on analysis of the space-time generating function, following the methods of Pemantle and Wilson (J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A 97(1):129\u2013161, 2002).\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nAharonov, Y., Davidovich, L., Zagury, N.: Quantum random walks. Phys. Rev.

This became problematic for spam.\n\n2. **Development of new remote access protocols**: To combat the spam problem from open relays, authentication protocols were developed.\n\n3. **Intermediate protocol that verified user's ability to receive mail before allowing send**: This is \"POP before SMTP\" - it required users to first check their mail (via POP3) before being allowed to send mail via SMTP.\n\n4. **This was superseded by**: SMTP AUTH (SMTP Authentication), which standardized sender login by requiring authentication directly through SMTP.\n\n5. **Fundamental to operation of software agent that processes outgoing mail**: SMTP AUTH is fundamental to the operation of a **Mail Submission Agent (MSA)**, which processes outgoing mail from the user's application.\n\n6. **Often using a distinct communication channel**: MSAs typically use port 587 (submission port) rather than the standard SMTP port 25.\n\n7. **Cooperates with different agent for routing between computer systems**: The MSA hands mail off to a **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**, which handles the actual routing between systems.\n\n8. **End-user interacts directly with software acting on their behalf**: This is the **Mail User Agent (MUA)**, like an email client or web browser.\n\n9. **Web navigation application on specific model of tablet computer from early 2010s**: This refers to Safari on the original iPad (iPad 1), released in 2010.\n\n10. **Identification string denoting core rendering engine technology**: The user agent string contains information about the rendering engine.\n\nLooking at the iPad 1 user agent string:\n`Mozilla\/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit\/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version\/4.0.4 Mobile\/7B334b Safari\/531.21.10`\n\nThe sequence that denotes the core rendering engine technology appears after the device and OS details but before compatibility information: **AppleWebKit\/531.21.10**\n\nHowever, the question asks for the \"particular sequence of characters and numbers\" that denotes the core rendering engine technology.

Historians consider this city to be on a par with Babylon, Thebes, Athens, Rome, and other similar cities. There are different views on the etymology of the toponym. Almost all researchers consider the second part toponym to be Turkish \u2013 \u201ckent\u201d, - \u201ckand\u201d, meaning village, city.\n\nAccording to \u201cKent\u201d Mahmoud Kashgari, every city on the east side is mentioned (DLT, 1, p. 327). But the first part of the toponym is interpreted differently in the sources. In some sources Samar is associated with the name of a man, the name of the commander, while in others Samara is interpreted as a city of fruits, crops, sweets etc.\n\nBeruni writes: \"Samarkand is \u201cSamizkand\u201d in Turkish, one of the cities of enlightenment.\" \"The Oguzs and those close to them call Samarkand \u201cSamizkand\u201d-fat because of its size,\" Kashgari said.\n\nHasanov, agreed with this etymology of the toponym, connected another comment, the first part of the name, with the Persian \u201cHamara\u201d with the word \"meeting, gathering\" and said \"gathering place, consultative village\". interprets the name as \u201ca village near a stream\u201d (Dosimov Z., Egamov H.

More precisely, there exists a Cantor set $C$ in the state space such that the network has sensitive dependence on initial conditions at initial states in $C$ and the network orbit of each initial state in $C$ has $C$ as its $\\omega$-limit set. The approach we use is based on tools developed and employed recently in the study of the topological dynamics of piecewise-contractions. The parameters of the chaotic network are explicitly given.\n\n### References & Citations\n\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_cd57f228dee24ef5ac0f33fc\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"chaotic discrete-time continuous-state Hopfield network\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"piecewise-affine activation functions\\\\\\\" 1990s\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: A chaotic discrete-time continuous-state Hopfield network ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/7545ac6d0ef538a55bb612d6a7f32cd228d57686\nA chaotic discrete-time continuous-state Hopfield network with piecewise-affine activation functions ... 1990s.

Together with a colleague specializing in neural networks from the same institution, they shifted focus to densely connected systems of continuous-state units. Their investigation explored the intricate 'movements' and potential for unpredictable, non-repeating patterns arising when these units, linked by Hebbian principles, possess activation responses that deviate significantly from the standard smoothed threshold curve.

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

America's One-Room Schools One-room schools still exist in America, although they've dwindled from 190,000 in 1919 to fewer than 400 today. The bulk of them are in isolated Western towns. But there are schools sprinkled across the United States.\nQ: What did a one-room schoolhouse look like?\nA: One-room schoolhouses vary by geographic region and time period. Building materials ranged from wood, to brick, to stone. Most were rectangular in form but there was a trend to construct octagonal one-room schoolhouses, in hope of better lighting each scholar's workspace.\nQ: When were school houses used?\nA: The first public schools in the United States were built in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Typically, these were one-room schoolhouses, constructed in communities to teach a small number of students the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_4a9486ef379d4c30838483af\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Mydland\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"one-room schoolhouses\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"American Midwest and Norway\\\\\\\" 2001\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: The legacy of one-room schoolhouses: A comparative ...\nURL: https:\/\/journals.openedition.org\/ejas\/9205\nby L Mydland \u00b7 2011 \u00b7 Cited by 27 \u2014 Leidulf Mydland, \u201cThe legacy of one-room schoolhouses: A comparative study of the American Midwest and Norway\u201d, European journal of American studies [Online] ...Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 1: A comparative study of the American Midwest and Norway\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/276332816_The_legacy_of_one-room_schoolhouses_A_comparative_study_of_the_American_Midwest_and_Norway\nThe legacy of one-room schoolhouses: A comparative study of the American Midwest and Norway ...

This neighboring settlement, also originating in that historical period, was another territory controlled by this extensive empire, which was distinguished by its management of vital watercourses and its far-reaching trade networks before its power waned, enabling one of its own military commanders to rise to prominence. This commander, having previously served the declining empire, successfully broke away to institute his own dynastic sovereignty.

According to the legend, it was founded in the 10th century by Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi,[1] a Persian prince of Shiraz.[2]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The history of the Kilwa Sultanate begins around 960\u20131000 AD.[3] According to legend, Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi was one of seven sons of a ruler of Shiraz, Persia, his mother an Abyssinian slave. Upon his father's death, Ali was driven out of his inheritance by his brothers.[4] Setting sail out of Hormuz, Ali ibn al-Hassan, his household and a small group of followers first made their way to Mogadishu, the main commercial city of the East African coast. However, Ali failed to get along with the city's Somali elite and he was soon driven out of that city as well.\n\nSteering down the African coast, Ali is said to have purchased the island of Kilwa from the local Bantu inhabitants. According to one chronicle (Strong (1895)), Kilwa was originally owned by a mainland Bantu king 'Almuli' and connected by a small land bridge to the mainland that appeared in low tide. The king agreed to sell it to Ali ibn al-Hassan for as much colored cloth as could cover the circumference of the island. But when the king later changed his mind, and tried to take it back, the Persians had dug up the land bridge, and Kilwa was now an island.\n\nA genetic study, published on March 29, 2023, confirmed the presence of significant Iranian-origin ancestry in the Y-chromosomal DNA of medieval inhabitants of the Swahili Coast, strongly supporting elements of the Persian-admixture narrative.[5]\n\nKilwa's fortuitous position made it a much better East African trade center than Mogadishu. It quickly began to attract many merchants and immigrants from further north, including Persia and Arabia. In just a few years, the city was big enough to establish a satellite settlement at nearby Mafia Island.\n\nKilwa's emergence as a commercial center challenged the dominance once held by Mogadishu over the East African coast. Suleiman Hassan, the ninth successor of Ali (and 12th ruler of Kilwa, c. 1178\u20131195), wrested control of the southerly city of Sofala from the Mogadishans. Wealthy Sofala was the principal entrepot for the gold and ivory trade with Great Zimbabwe and Monomatapa in the interior. The acquisition of Sofala brought a windfall of gold revenues to the Kilwa Sultans, which allowed them to finance their expansion and extend their powers all along the East African coast.\n\nAt the zenith of its power in the 15th century, the Kilwa Sultanate owned or claimed overlordship over the mainland cities of Malindi, Lamu, Inhambane, and Sofala and the island-states of Mombasa, Pemba, Zanzibar, Mafia, Comoro, and Mozambique (plus numerous smaller places) \u2013 essentially what is now often referred to as the \"Swahili Coast\".[6]\n\nKilwa also claimed lordship across the channel over the myriad of small trading posts scattered on the coast of Madagascar (then known by its Arabic name of *Island of the Moon*). To the north, Kilwa's power was checked by the independent Somali city-state of Mogadishu (the once-dominant city, Kilwa's main rival) and the Adal Sultanate (the Muslim Sultanate located in the Horn of Africa). To the south, Kilwa's reach extended as far as Cape Correntes, below which merchant ships did not usually dare sail.[7]\n\nWhile a single figure, the Sultan of Kilwa, stood at the top of the hierarchy, the Kilwa Sultanate was not a centralized state. It was more a confederation of commercial cities, each with its own internal elite, merchant communities and trade connections. The Sultan might appoint a governor or overseer, but even his authority was not consistent \u2013 in some places (e.g. outposts like Mozambique Island) he was a true governor in the Sultan's name, whereas in more established cities like Sofala, his powers were much more limited, more akin to an ambassador to the city than its governor.\n\n## Society and economy\n\n[edit]Despite its origin as a Persian colony, extensive inter-marriage and conversion of local Bantu inhabitants and later Arab immigration turned the Kilwa Sultanate into a veritable melting pot, ethnically indifferentiable from the mainland. Recent ancient DNA[8] studies have confirmed that Asian ancestry in the medieval period originally came from Iran, and that Asian and African ancestors began mixing at least 1,000 years ago.[9]\n\nThe mixture of Perso-Arab and Bantu cultures is credited for creating a distinctive East African culture and language known today as Swahili (literally, 'coast-dwellers'). Nonetheless, the Muslims of Kilwa (whatever their ethnicity) would often refer to themselves generally as Shirazi or Arabs, and to the unconverted Bantu peoples of the mainland as Zanj or *Kuffar* ('infidels').\n\nThe Kilwa Sultanate was almost wholly dependent on external commerce. Effectively, it was a confederation of urban settlements, with trade being the backbone of its economy. While there was some local agriculture, the sultanate relied heavily on trade to sustain its urban populations. Grains (principally millet and rice), meats (cattle, poultry), and other necessary supplies had to be purchased from the Bantu tribes of the interior. Kilwan traders encouraged the development of market towns in the Bantu-dominated highlands of what are now Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, where agricultural commodities such as grain and meat were exchanged for luxury goods and raw materials like gold and ivory.\n\nThe Kilwan mode of living was that of middlemen traders, who imported manufactured goods (like cloth and spices) from Arabia, India, and Persia, and exchanged them in the interior for agricultural products and precious raw materials, like gold and ivory. These were then exported to other parts of the Indian Ocean world, including Arabia, Persia, India, and even China. Kilwa\u2019s economy also saw significant involvement in the slave trade, with the majority of slaves coming from the Bantu peoples of the interior, as well as from the highland regions of East Africa and occasionally from other groups from the Horn of Africa. Slaves were often captured in raids or conflicts and sold to markets in the Arabian Peninsula, Persia, and India.\n\nA notable exception to Kilwa's reliance on external trade was the coconut palm tree. Grown all along the coast, the coconut palm was the mainstay of Kilwan life in every way \u2013 not only for its fruit, but also for timber, thatching, and weaving. Kilwan merchant ships \u2013 from the large lateen-rigged dhows that plied the open oceans to the small *zambucs* used for local transit \u2013 were usually built from the split trunks of coconut palm wood, their sails made from coconut leaf matting, and the ships held together by coconut coir.\n\nKilwa Sultanate conducted extensive trade with Arabia, Persia, and across the Indian Ocean to India itself. Coins from the Kilwa Sultanate have been found as far as the Wessel Islands in Australia, which was inhabited by the Yolngu at that time. Kilwan ships made use of the seasonal monsoon winds to sail across to India in the summer and back to Africa in the winter. Kilwan pilots were renowned for their extraordinary sailing accuracy, and Portuguese sailors marveled at their navigational instruments, particularly their latitude staves, which they considered superior to their own.\n\nNonetheless, the coir-sewn Kilwan ships were not seaworthy enough to brave the treacherous waters and unpredictable violent gusts around Cape Correntes, so the entire region south of that point was rarely sailed by Kilwan merchants. Inhambane was the most southerly settlement that can be considered part of the Kilwan trading empire.\n\n## Decline and fall\n\n[edit]In its later years, the Sultans of Kilwa began falling into the hands of their ambitious ministers (viziers and emirs), who played the roles of kingmakers, and *de facto* rulers, and occasionally tried to foist themselves (or one of their family members) on the throne, in competition with the royal dynasty. The most successful was probably Emir Muhammad Kiwabi, who ruled Kilwa for nearly two decades through several sultans, including himself at one point.[ citation needed]\n\nThroughout his long 'reign', Emir Muhammad fought an on-again and off-again battle with his nephew, Hassan ibn Suleiman (son of an earlier vizier). Muhammad had, in fact, tried to install Hassan as sultan a couple of times, but it met tremendous resistance from the population of Kilwa. Eventually, Emir Muhammad decided that, in the interests of constitutional propriety and civic peace, Kilwa sultans should always come from the royal dynasty, not families of viziers. Muhammad held that line more or less down to the end, thwarting Hassan's ambitions.[ citation needed] The last sultan installed by Emir Muhammad before his death was the royal prince al-Fudail ibn Suleiman in 1495. The man who succeeded to Muhammad's post, Emir Ibrahim (known as\n\n*Mir Habrahemo*in Barros,\n\n*Abraemo*in Goes), helped al-Fudail crush the ambitious Hassan once and for all in a great battle outside Kilwa. But it was not long after this battle that Emir Ibrahim is said to have betrayed and murdered sultan al-Fudail. Rather than declare himself sultan, Ibrahim took power merely with the title of\n\n*emir*, and claimed to be exercising rule in the name of a son of an earlier sultan Suleiman (ibn Muhammad?) of the old royal dynasty. That no one had seen or heard of this absent prince for years was quite convenient for Emir Ibrahim.\n\n[Emir Ibrahim's usurpation was met with shock not only in Kilwa, but in the vassal cities as well. Emir Muhammad had (belatedly) recognized the importance of constitutional propriety for peace in the Kilwa Sultanate. Emir Ibrahim's murderous coup had run roughshod over it. Most of the local governors of the Kilwa vassal cities, many who were either relatives or had owed their positions to Emir Muhammad and the royal dynasty, refused to acknowledge the usurpation of Emir Ibrahim, and began charting an independent course for their own city-states. The writ of Emir Ibrahim probably only covered the city of Kilwa itself and possibly Mozambique Island.\n\n*citation needed*][10]\n\nThis was more or less the condition of the Kilwa Sultanate when the Portuguese arrived.\n\n## Portuguese era\n\n[edit]Source:[11]\n\nPortuguese scout P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3, disguised as an Arab merchant, had travelled the length of the Kilwa Sultanate in 1489\u20131490, and visited the ports of Malindi, Kilwa and Sofala, and delivered his scouting report back to Lisbon, describing the condition of the Kilwa Sultanate in quite some detail.[12] The first Portuguese ships, under Vasco da Gama, on their way to India, reached the sultanate in 1497. Da Gama made contact with the Kilwa vassals of Mozambique, Mombassa, and Malindi, seeking to secure their cooperation as staging posts for the Portuguese India Armadas.\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification. (October 2025) |\n\nIn 1500, the 2nd Portuguese India Armada, under Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral, visited Kilwa itself, and attempted to negotiate a commercial and alliance treaty with Emir Ibrahim. But emir prevaricated and no agreement was reached.\n\nThe well-armed Fourth Armada of 1502, under Vasco da Gama again, came in a more mean-spirited mood, indisposed to take no for an answer. Having secured separate treaties with Malindi, Mozambique and all-important Sofala, the Portuguese brought their menacing fleet to bear on Kilwa itself, and extorted a sizeable tribute from Emir Ibrahim.\n\nSome have speculated whether Emir Ibrahim missed a golden opportunity to restore his fortunes, that had a treaty with Cabral been reached back in 1500, he might have secured the assistance of the Portuguese navy in bringing the half-independent vassals back under his sway. At least one Kilwan nobleman, a certain Muhammad ibn Rukn ad Din (known to the Portuguese as Muhammad Arcone), certainly advised Emir Ibrahim to strike up an alliance with the Portuguese (and for his pains, was given up as a hostage to the Portuguese by the Emir, who then refused ransom him back \u2013 allowing him to be subjected to da Gama's wrath).\n\nAs it turns out, the vassals used the Portuguese, one by one, to secure their permanent break from the Sultanate. The ruler of Malindi was the first to embrace the Portuguese, forging an alliance in 1497 (largely to be directed against Mombassa). After Emir Ibrahim's coup, it was certainly not hard to persuade the ruling sheikh Isuf of Sofala (Y\u00e7uf in Barros, \u00c7ufe in Goes; he was apparently a nephew of the late Emir Muhammad) to break away. He signed a treaty with the Portuguese in 1502, and followed it up by allowing the construction of a Portuguese factory and fort in Sofala in 1505.\n\nIt was in 1505 that Francisco de Almeida brought his fleet into the harbor of Kilwa, and landed some 500 Portuguese soldiers to drive Emir Ibrahim out of the city. Almeida installed the aforementioned Muhammad Arcone on the throne, as a Portuguese vassal. Remembering constitutional proprieties, Arcone insisted that Micante, the son of the late sultan al-Fudail be his designated successor. The Portuguese erected a fortress (Fort Santiago) on Kilwa and left a garrison behind, under the command of Pedro Ferreira Foga\u00e7a, to keep an eye on things.\n\nPortuguese rule was not very welcome. Particularly grating was the imposition of Portuguese mercantilist laws on the sultanate, forbidding all but Portuguese ships to carry trade to the principal coastal towns \u2013 essentially putting many leading Kilwan merchants out of business.\n\nThe Portuguese did not stay very long. In May, 1506, Muhammad Arcone was lured and assassinated by the sheikh of Tirendicunde (a relative of Emir Ibrahim). As per the pre-arranged succession rule, Micante ascended to the throne. However, Foga\u00e7a, seeing that Micante's ascension was supported by the old faction of Emir Ibrahim, concluded he would not do as a Portuguese puppet. Consequently, he deposed Micante and installed Hussein ibn Muhammad, a son of Arcone, as the new sultan.\n\nChaos broke out in the city of Kilwa. Partisans of Micante (and Emir Ibrahim) seized control of much of the city, driving sultan Hussein (and the partisans of Arcone) to seek refuge by the Portuguese Fort Santiago. Street fighting and soon fires broke out. In the chaos, streams of Kilwan residents fled the city, leaving it practically deserted, save for a handful of roving partisan gangs and the terrified Portuguese garrison.\n\nHearing of the Kilwan chaos all the way in India, the Portuguese viceroy Almeida dispatched a magistrate Nuno Vaz Pereira to inquire into the matter. Arriving in late 1506, Pereira convened the competing sultans Micante and Hussein, and asked them present their cases. Pereira ruled in favor of Hussein, confirming him as sultan, but softened the blow by relieving the unpopular commander Foga\u00e7a and lifting the mercantilist restrictions on Kilwa shipping.\n\nThe Kilwan refugees returned and a modicum of peace resumed, but only briefly. For Hussein put it in his head to lead the Kilwan army against Tirendicunde, to avenge his father's murder. The town was brutally sacked, and numerous prisoners taken. Hussein then dispatched emissaries to all the vassal cities of the Kilwa Sultanate, ordering them to return to obedience, or else meet the same fate.\n\nFearing that Hussein's spate of tyranny might jeopardize Portuguese interests in East Africa, Viceroy Almeida reversed Pereira's decision, deposed Hussein and reinstated Micante.\n\n## Rulers\n\n[edit]The chronology of rulers of the Kilwa Sultanate is reported in a chronicle translated into Portuguese in the 16th century, and recorded by the chronicler Jo\u00e3o de Barros.[13] There is another surviving chronicle (Zanzibar chronicle) by an unknown author, written in the early 16th century, and compiled in 1862 by (or for) sheikh Moheddin (Majid?) of Zanzibar.[a] The Barros and Zanzibar chronicle are not always in concordance with each other. The following follows Barros in its outlines, but fills in details from the Zanzibar chronicle. Alternative spellings and nicknames, mainly given in Barros's chronicle, are in italics.

According to the Wikipedia article on Kilwa Sultanate, it was founded by Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi, a Persian prince who was \"driven out of his inheritance by his brothers\" and later \"driven out of Mogadishu\" before establishing his coastal dominion at Kilwa.\n\n## Step 2: Historical figure who was banished and established coastal dominion\n\nFrom the Kilwa Sultanate article: \"According to legend, Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi was one of seven sons of a ruler of Shiraz, Persia... Upon his father's death, Ali was driven out of his inheritance by his brothers. Setting sail out of Hormuz, Ali ibn al-Hassan, his household and a small group of followers first made their way to Mogadishu... However, Ali failed to get along with the city's Somali elite and he was soon driven out of that city as well.\"\n\nThis matches the description of a historical figure following a period of banishment who established his own coastal dominion.\n\n## Step 3: Principal urban center as ancient port\n\nThe capital of the Kilwa Sultanate was Kilwa Kisiwani, described as an ancient port city.\n\n## Step 4: Neighboring settlement developed concurrently under medieval empire\n\nThe riddle mentions that Kilwa developed as an outpost \"concurrently with a neighboring settlement, both under the authority of an earlier, formidable medieval empire.\" This suggests both settlements were established under the same empire.\n\n## Step 5: Empire distinguished by watercourses management and trade networks\n\nThe Kilwa Sultanate article mentions extensive trade networks with Arabia, Persia, India, and China, and that it was part of the broader Swahili Coast trade complex.\n\n## Step 6: Military commander who broke away to establish dynastic sovereignty\n\nThis is where the riddle becomes more complex. The Kilwa Sultanate declined, and various military leaders vied for power. However, the riddle seems to be pointing to a different sequence.\n\nLet me search for more specific information about the connection between Kilwa and other settlements, and the empire that controlled both.\n\n## Step 7: State with town having traditional combat festival\n\nThe riddle mentions a town \"celebrated for an annual traditional combat festival\" that was controlled by the commander's lineage.\n\n## Step 8: Geodetic system based on mathematical representation of Earth\n\nFinally, this town uses a geodetic system based on a particular mathematical representation of the Earth.\n\nLet me search for more specific information about traditional combat festivals and geodetic systems.\n","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_c8399e47bfaf4e20b112dc46\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"traditional combat festival\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"annual\\\\\\\" Africa geodetic system\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"traditional combat festival\" \"annual\" Africa geodetic system","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_0987d870e1a541ad8f5f5965\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"stick fighting\\\\\\\" festival Africa annual traditional\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Istunka\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Istunka\nSee also. edit \u00b7 Culture of Somalia \u00b7 Martial arts \u00b7 Stick fighting \u00b7 Mock combat.

Consisting of several teams engaging each other in mock combat, it is celebrated alongside other ceremonies such as Dabshiid.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The Istunka tournament was developed in the Middle Ages, during the Ajuran period. It was celebrated annually on the Somali new year alongside other festivals such as Nowruz. The martial arts festival later became a centralized tournament under the Sultanate of the Geledi. During the reign of Sultan Ahmed Yusuf, separate teams were established, each supported by an assembly of poets, female vocalists and dance groups throughout the duration of the contest.[4]\n\nIn the modern era, the festival evolved into a local attraction; particularly during the 1970s and 80s. It is still practiced annually in the southern Afgooye region.\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]The event itself consists of a mock fight between the people residing on each side of the river bed in the town of Afgooye. Symbolizing the defence of one's community and honor, it coincides with the start of the main harvest season. Istunka was originally performed in full combat gear, with battle-axes, swords and daggers. However, for safety reasons, performers later replaced those weapons with large sticks or batons.[2]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Istunka: A New Year's Ritual\".

The principal urban center of this newly formed dominion, an ancient port, is noted to have developed as an outpost concurrently with a neighboring settlement, both under the authority of an earlier, formidable medieval empire. This neighboring settlement, also originating in that historical period, was another territory controlled by this extensive empire, which was distinguished by its management of vital watercourses and its far-reaching trade networks before its power waned, enabling one of its own military commanders to rise to prominence. This commander, having previously served the declining empire, successfully broke away to institute his own dynastic sovereignty. The resultant state governed by this commander's lineage held sway over several areas, including a notable town celebrated for an annual traditional combat festival.

(January 2011) |\n\n**Snape Maltings Concert Hall** is an arts complex on the banks of the River Alde at Snape, Suffolk, England. It is best known as one of the main sites of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. It is now one of two headquarters for Britten Pears Arts, with the other being The Red House.\n\nThe original purpose of the Maltings was the malting of barley for the brewing of beer; local barley, once malted, was sent from here to London and exported to mainland Europe. Today a collection of shops, galleries, restaurants and the Concert Hall fill the old buildings. The Alde estuary is known for wildlife and river trips.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The complex of malting buildings was begun in 1846 and extended in the later 19th century.[1] Newson Garrett, a Victorian entrepreneur, built the Maltings in the 1800s; his name appears on plaques around the site. The river made Garrett decide to build a maltings at this already busy port. Newson was ambitious and determined and in 1841 purchased the business of Osborne and Fennell, corn and coal merchants of Snape Bridge. From this port the Maltings began to evolve, using the River Alde to transport barley across Britain and into Europe on Thames barges. Within three years of his arrival, Newson Garrett was shipping 17,000 quarters of barley a year from Snape. Much of this barley would have been destined for breweries, where it had first to be malted. Newson saw an opportunity. Snape was in the heart of good agricultural land, and halfway between the brewing area of Norwich and London. Demand from the London breweries was growing fast, and it was becoming impractical to make malt and brew beer on the same premises. In 1854 he began malting at Snape, and was soon shipping malt, rather than barley to the breweries.\n\nThe Maltings process at Snape came to an end in the 1960s as Swonnell and Son went into liquidation and seven acres of industrial buildings were left vacant. Thirty acres of land was offered for sale, including dwellings and an inn. It was difficult to imagine how such functional structures could be put to different use. However George Gooderham, a local farmer and businessman, recognised the potential. He purchased the site and set about finding alternative uses for the buildings.\n\nBy the 1960s the Aldeburgh Music Festival was outgrowing the limited space available in the Jubilee Hall. Benjamin Britten started to look around for somewhere to build a concert hall. Britten had the vision to see the largest Malthouse, in its magnificent setting overlooking the saltings as a possible site. Negotiations began with George Gooderham and after little more than a year Snape Maltings Concert Hall was ready to be opened by the Queen at the start of the 1967 Aldeburgh Festival.\n\nIn 2015, the maltings was sold for an undisclosed sum to Aldeburgh Music, who had been renting some of the buildings. Snape Maltings is now a registered charity.\n\n## Benjamin Britten\n\n[edit]The composer Benjamin Britten was inspired by the vast skies and moody seas of the Suffolk coast, and in 1948, along with singer Peter Pears and writer Eric Crozier, he founded the Aldeburgh Festival. Britten and Pears made a point of educating and supporting young artists. They brought together international stars and emerging talent, including world-renowned figures such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Yehudi Menuhin, Sviatoslav Richter and Mstislav Rostropovich, and young stars in the making such as Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, Murray Perahia and Julian Bream.\n\n## Venues\n\n[edit]At first the Festival used local halls and churches but in 1967, Britten and Pears created a permanent home at Snape, 5 miles from Aldeburgh, by converting the Victorian maltings into an 832-seat venue. Within five years Britten and Pears had reclaimed more buildings on the site to establish a centre for talented young musicians.\n\nIn 2006 Aldeburgh Music purchased a 999-year lease of the Snape Maltings Concert Hall, investing around \u00a314 million in new studios and rehearsal spaces which came into use in 2009. The \"Creative Campus\" at Snape Maltings has four performance venues (from 70 to 830 capacity) and over 20 rehearsal and public spaces. Aldeburgh Music purchased the full property in 2015.[2]\n\n### Snape Maltings Concert Hall\n\n[edit]Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Concert Hall Gallery, Oyster Bar and Restaurant\n\nBuilt by Newson Garrett in the mid-19th century, the 832-seat Concert Hall began life as a malthouse. The conversion of the building was undertaken by Arup Associates, with the acoustics supervised by Derek Sugden. Work started on site in 1966. Officially opened in 1967 by Queen Elizabeth II, the Hall suffered serious fire damage two years later, re-opening in time for the Aldeburgh Festival the following year.\n\n### Hoffmann Building\n\n[edit]Britten Studio, Jerwood Kiln Studio, rehearsal rooms. Opened in May 2009, the Hoffmann Building features two spaces suitable for performances as well as a number of additional rehearsal rooms, office space and a social area. The centrepiece of the building is the new Britten Studio, designed to have an excellent and flexible acoustic with a high level of sound insulation for recording. Ideal for orchestral rehearsals, it can also be used as a 340-seat venue.\n\nThe Jerwood Kiln Studio, which seats up to 80 people in a flexible configuration, is an ideal space for smaller groups to rehearse, and is equipped for video and electro-acoustic installations. The Studio retains the double-height roof and much of the existing fabric of the original kiln structure.\n\n### Britten\u2013Pears Building\n\n[edit]Peter Pears Recital Room, Holst Library, rehearsal rooms. A former barley store, the Britten\u2013Pears Building was officially opened in 1979 by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\n\n### Holst Library\n\n[edit]The Holst Library is connected to the Maltings. Many of the original contents were donated by Imogen Holst, who was a close friend of Benjamin Britten and an artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival from 1956 to 1977, and it was named the Gustav Holst Library as a memorial to her father. According to her press release for the Aldeburgh Festival Office, \"the Gustav Holst Library will be a working library for the use of the students. It is being called after him in gratitude for his music and his teaching.\"\n\nThe library was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and is open by appointment. It is situated in two rooms on the second floor of the BPP buildings in the Snape Maltings complex. The collection comprises books, scores and audio materials (LP, tape and CD) covering many genres. Much of the Library's stock is available for searching on the web catalogue of the Britten-Pears Library.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**Historic England. \"Details from listed building database (1377150)\".*National Heritage List for England*.**^**Potter, Tom; Cornwell, Richard (11 October 2020). \"Aldeburgh Music purchases Snape Maltings complex in multi-million pound deal\".*East Anglian Daily Times*.\n\n## External links\n\n[edit]- Map sources for Snape Maltings Concert Hall\n- Snape Maltings Website\n- Holst Library website\n- Historic England. \"Details from listed building database (1377150)\".\n*National Heritage List for England*.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_81e246a1ccbd42f398f83c3b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Benjamin Britten early 1960s arrangement traditional song Aldeburgh Festival\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Britten: Complete Folk Song Arrangements - CDD22042\nURL: https:\/\/www.hyperion-records.co.uk\/dc.asp?dc=D_CDD22042\nAt a recital at the 1958 Aldeburgh Festival, on 17 June, Pears and Julian Bream rounded off a recital which included the first performance of Britten's Songs ...\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Festival at Aldeburgh Presents Premieres of 3 Britten Works\nURL: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1965\/06\/25\/archives\/festival-at-aldeburgh-presents-premieres-of-3-britten-works.html\nThe \"Songs and Proverbs of William Blake\" were given an impressive first performance this evening by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, with Mr. Britten at the piano.\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Benjamin Britten's Aldeburgh - Britten 100 - YouTube\nURL: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kc7w3tvcRXg\nJohn Bridcut and Susan Bullock on Aldeburgh, the coastal town in Suffolk that inspired Benjamin Britten's Gloriana.\n\n---\n\nResult 3: BRITTEN, B.: Folk Song Arrangements, Vol. 2 (Engli.. - 8.557222\nURL: https:\/\/www.naxos.com\/catalogue\/item.asp?item_code=8.557222\n...

Diastatic malt flour is used to increase the fermentation rate of dough. It is also used to add flavour and colour to the bread.\nQ: How much malted barley flour to add to bread?\nA: You only need very small quantities of diastatic malt, about 5g or 1 tsp (or 1% of flour weight) per loaf of bread to get good results. Because there is also something like too much diastatic malt which can result in a reddish instead of a golden crust, weak dough and a rubbery crumb.\nQ: Can you use barley flour in place of all-purpose flour?\nA: Use barley flour to replace half to all the white flour in muffins, pancakes, quick breads, cookies and waffles. For best results with yeast breads and pizza crusts, only swap a quarter to a half of the total flour with barley flour.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_b58a526dfb5a42bf8727bedf\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Finnish saaristolaislimppu northern European bread brewing liquid\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Traditional Finnish Archipelago Bread\nURL: https:\/\/windfromthenorth.com\/archipelago-bread-recipe\/\nThis traditional bread from the Finnish archipelago has a sweet, malty and syrupy taste.

The term originated late in the 19th century for the area between R\u00e9aumur and Op\u00e9ra in the 2nd arrondissement which housed most of the major French newspapers of the time.[1] Several newspapers and press agencies retain premises in the area even today.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The district was centred on the junction between rue du Croissant and rue Montmartre, site of the caf\u00e9 du Croissant, which on 31 July 1914 saw the assassination of Jean Jaur\u00e8s, founder and director of *L'Humanit\u00e9*. In the district major press businesses tried to establish rules and means for their economic development, such as issuing cards to those who delivered and resold newspapers.[2]\n\nNot far from the Bourse and Grands boulevards, the district housed most of Paris' newspaper presses and newsrooms, where journalists and press barons set up organisations such as Edgar Monteil's Association syndicale professionnelle des journalistes r\u00e9publicains fran\u00e7ais (ASPJRF)[3] This was a boom era for the French press \u2013 in 1914 it was the most widely-read in the world with 244 copies for every 1,000 inhabitants.[4] and well-known reporters such as Pierre Giffard, Jules Huret, Gaston Leroux, Pierre Mille, S\u00e9verine and Fernand Xau.\n\nAt the time the French media scene was dominated by four daily newspapers published in Paris \u2013 *Le Matin*, *Le Petit Parisien* under Albert Londres and Jean Dupuy, *Le Petit Journal* and *Le Journal*.\n\n## Timeline\n\n[edit]- In 1825, Charles-Louis Havas, ruined by the 1825 crisis at the London Stock Exchange, set up the Bureau de traduction des journaux \u00e9trangers, later known as the Bureau de nouvelles, at 4 rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n- In 1832, the\n*Gazette des chemins de fer*, revived in 1855 by Jacques Bresson, also known as \"Cours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des actions\", set up offices at 31 place de la Bourse. -

As such, it gained prestigious restaurants, brasseries, theatres and opera houses.\n\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique set up Salle Favart on 28 April 1783 in the gardens of the H\u00f4tel de Choiseul (Paris), on a site intended for the Caisse d'Escompte, then in 1801 merged with the neighbouring Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Feydeau. In 1827 it moved next door to become the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Nouveaut\u00e9s, Place de la Bourse, then in 1829 into the Salle Ventadour. On 13 February 1820 the duc de Berry's murder as he left the op\u00e9ra de la rue de Richelieu opposite the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Louvois led Louis XVIII to order its demolition. The Op\u00e9ra Le Peletier replaced it a year later in the gardens of the H\u00f4tel Laborde, but burned down in 1873, a year before the opening of the Palais Garnier.\n\nFor dining there were Caf\u00e9 Gobillard, Restaurant Champeaux, Brasserie Gallopin, Caf\u00e9 Tortoni and Caf\u00e9 des arcades, all around the Place de la Bourse, with La sole Marguery also on boulevard de Bonne-Nouvelle and the Maison Dor\u00e9e under Casimir Moisson at 20 Boulevard des Italiens.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**(in French)*Passeurs culturels dans le monde des m\u00e9dias et de l'\u00e9dition en Europe XIXe et XXe si\u00e8cles)*, by Diana Cooper-Richet, Jean-Yves Mollier and A.

In the aftermath of major Hubert-Joseph Henry's suicide it sponsored a public subscription in favour of the widow in which the donors could express a wish. (A short sample: 0.5 francs \"by a cook who would like to put the Jews in her ovens\"; 5 francs \"by a vicar who ardently wish to exterminate all Jews and Freemasons\"; 1 franc \"by a little vicar of Poitou who would be happy to sing with joy a Requiem for the last Jew left\".)[2] Drumont and his collaborators claimed a link between Jews and capitalism, which shaped the anti-capitalist views of *La Libre Parole*.\n\nDrumont left the management of the newspaper in 1898 when he made his entry in politics (elected as deputy of Algiers until 1902). Around 1908, wishing to sell *La Libre Parole* to L\u00e9on Daudet, Drumont tried to merge the newspaper with *L'Action fran\u00e7aise*, but the project failed.\n\nFollowing the death of editor Gaston M\u00e9ry in 1909,[3] Drumont sold *La Libre Parole* to Joseph Denais in October 1910, who appointed Henri Bazire as new editor-in-chief.[4] The paper became a Catholic organ, close to the Popular Liberal Action and never regained the level of success it had enjoyed with the belligerent style of Drumont. In January 1919, he published a statement by the Marquis de l'Estourbeillon in favour of the teaching of Breton in school.\n\nAntisemitism in France declined during the 1920s, in part because the fact that so many Jews died fighting for France during World War I made it more difficult to accuse them of not being patriotic. *La Libre Parole*, which had once sold 300,000 copies per issue, closed in 1924.[5]\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]The legacy of Drumont's daily newspaper was claimed by several ephemeral publications that reused the title *La Libre Parole* for nationalist and xenophobic organizations:\n\n(1**La Libre parole**erno), later(Paris, 7 novembre 1926 \u2013 avril 1929).**La Libre parole r\u00e9publicaine**(later Fontainebleau) (1928-1929 [?]) represents itself in 1929 as being the continuation of Drumont's daily newspaper;**La Libre Parole de Paris**\n\n### 1930\u20131940s: the *Libre parole* of Henry Coston\n\n[edit], \"Monthly review\", later \"Anti-judeo-masonic review\" (Brunoy later Paris, 1930\u20131936), edited by Henry Coston. In April 1935 it absorbed the biweekly**La Libre parole***Le Porc-\u00e9pic*(*The Porcupine*) and then appeared as. In October 1937, it was replaced by**La Libre parole et le Porc-\u00e9pic***Le Si\u00e8cle nouveau*, a monthly magazine published by the National Office of Propaganda (Vichy). This*Libre parole*was published in parallel with the following:, \"Independent nationalist body\", monthly magazine (Paris, I\u2013III, October 1930\u20131932), edited by Henry Coston. It also appeared in the same year under the name**La Libre Parole**.**La Libre parole politique et sociale**- It later became\n, \"Monthly publication continuing the work of \u00c9douard Drumont\" (Paris, I-II, 1933 \u2013 November 1934).**La Libre parole populaire** - It changed name again to\n, \"Journal de propagande nationaliste\" (Paris, December 1934\u20131935).**Libres paroles** - Yet another change to\n\"Journal hebdomadaire\" (Paris, September 1935 \u2013 April 1939). In 1938, Coston officially took over the volume numbers of Drumont's**La Libre parole***La Libre parole*.\n\n- It later became\n- Algiers deputy candidate Coston renamed his newspaper to\n(later**La Libre parole d'Alger**), \"Anti-jewish weekly of latin action\" and sometimes**Libre Parole nord-africaine d'Alger et du Nord de l'Afrique**(Alger, avril 1936 \u2013 f\u00e9vrier 1937 and a final issue in 1939). Henry Coston invoked, to justify the cessation of publication, the seizure of publications, leaflets, archives and documents in its offices.**La Parole encha\u00een\u00e9e**[6] - In 1940, the authorities of Nazi occupied France did not permit the newspaper to reappear. Coston used the title as a publishing label to publish, starting in 1943, the\n*Bulletin d'information anti-ma\u00e7onnique*(*Anti-masonic Information Bulletin*), and*Bulletin d'information sur la question juive*(*Information Bulletin on the Jewish Question*).\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**Brustein, William (2003).*Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust*.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

The newly elected municipal officers took office on January 1, 1923 to commence their four years terms in office.(The Daily Herald, July 7, 1922, p. 1)\nIn late May 1926, Mayor J.J. Kennedy was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to lobby against several bills in the Louisiana legislature that were serious impediments to the immediate future of the seafood industry at Biloxi. Sponsored by Senator Jules Fisher of Jefferson Parish and House Representative Allen J. Ellender (1890-1972) of Terrebonne Parish, this legislation sought to prevent person, firm, association or corporation that were not domiciled or residents of Louisiana from catching, taking, canning, packing, shucking, dealing in or transporting any oysters or shrimp harvested in the State waters of Louisiana. Mayor Kennedy was certain that the New Orleans\u2019 delegation to the Louisiana legislature would oppose these proposals.\nMayor Kennedy faced no Democratic opposition in the Democratic primary held at Biloxi on July 8, 1926.\nBy early February 1928, the new police station on the first floor of Biloxi\u2019s City Hall was nearing completion. Chief George Bills (1867-1945) had just hired Felix Mattina (1886-1946) and Frank Hecht (1901-1981) to the work with the night force to fill the void in his ranks created by the death of Officer Jake Stanovich (1891-1927). Mr. Mattina had prior law enforcement experience and had been a deputy sheriff. Frank Hecht had no police experience as he had worked for Standard Oil and the City Bus Company. With the new hires, the Biloxi night force consisted of the following men: Charles Lowd; Omer Graves (1886-1933); Evon Swetman; Richard Grady (1891-1958); and Lawrence Stockton (1893-1956). Chief Bills and Alonzo Gabrich (1894-1948), City Detective, comprised the day force.\nOn July 1, 1933, Mayor John Kennedy resigned his Mayoral post to accept the post of Comptroller of Customs, New Orleans, Louisiana for the Gulf District, which included Mississippi, Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, New Mexico, and Texas. His recommendation for this Federal position had come from U.S. Senator Byron Patton \u2018Pat\u201d Harrison (1881-1941) of Gulfport, Mississippi and an appointment from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945). Kennedy's presidential appointment was approved by the US Senate on June 13, 1933. It was decided that there would be no Mayor pro-tem or appointee named to replace John J. Kennedy. City Commissioners M.L. Michel and John A. Swanzy would manage the business of Biloxi until a new Mayor was elected. Some of the potential candidates to replace Mayor Kennedy were: John W. Apperson; Anthony V. Ragusin; John W. O'Keefe; William Baltar; Dr. A. Ferrer; William P. Kennedy; Jacinto Baltar; and Arnaud Lopez.\nIn March 1940, John J. Kennedy was elected exalted ruler of the Biloxi Elks Lodge replacing Denny Wambsgan. J.J. Kennedy had been exalted ruler in the past and was holding the office of trustee during the hotly contested contest for the Elk\u2019s leadership of the position in 1940. Mr. Kennedy was comptroller of Customs for New Orleans district. Other officers elected were: Clyde Campbell (1896-1954), esteemed leading knight; Chester H. Rose, esteemed lecturing knight; C.M. Drey, secretary; Eugene Lacaze (1869-1949), toiler; John E. Breaux, trustee; Joseph Lawrence, treasurer; W.F. Hubbell, Alternate to grand lodge.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRichard Hart Chinn (1888-1972), called Hart, was born on April 9, 1888 at Vandalia, Audrain County, Missouri, the son of James Buchanan \u2018Buck\u2019. Chinn (1857-1912) and Martha Ella Hart (1857-1938). Buck Chinn was born in Salem, Virginia the son of Robert Chinn (1822-1880+) and Frances A. Chinn (1826-1880+). By 1880, the Robert Chinn family had relocated to Ralls County in northeast Missouri where they were farmers. Buck Chinn was married circa 1880 and had a son, Roy Chinn (1881). His wife died and he married Martha E. Hart, a native of Winchester; Kentucky. In addition to Hart Chinn, Buck and Martha H. Chinn had Mary F. Chinn (1891-19 ); and Thomas Gill Chinn (1893-1953) who were born at Biloxi, Mississippi.\nIn 1890, Buck Chinn came to Biloxi to start the Biloxi Milling Company with fellow Missourians, E.G. Burklin, R.D. Chinn and Mr. Brewton. In April 1893,\nR. Hart Chinn (1888-1972), who would become Mayor of Biloxi in the 1930s, and Leo E. Ohr (1890-1970), Biloxi\u2019s master mechanic, were caught speeding on Ohr\u2019s motorcycle and charged with a violating the bicycle law. They appeared at the City court and were discharged by the judge because the City had no ordinances applicable to motorcycles.\nThe Chinn Motor Car Company was organized at Biloxi in September 1913. Initially Hart Chinn was the manager and often went to New Orleans to buy automobiles for the business. In September 1915, the Chinn Motor Car Company was incorporated as the Chinn Auto Company Inc. with Martha E. Chinn, Mary F. Chinn, and Thomas Gill Chinn as incorporators. The company was in business to buy, sell, and repair automobiles, as well as motorcycles and bicycles. The Chinn enterprise, situated on Reynoir Street between Howard Avenue and the L&N Depot, was considered as one of the well established car dealerships on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and had shown an increase in sales since its commencement.\nThe Chinn Auto Company sold the Saxon, Hudson, Hupmobile, and Overland brand of motorcars. When the Biloxi Airdome, an outdoor movie theatre, burned in early May 1914, the Chinn Motor Company was damaged by water to its fixtures and tools from the nearby conflagration.\nLt. Hart Chinn married Mrs. Vera L. Dukate Bond (1886-1977) on November 11, 1918 at Camp Sherman, Ohio. She had two daughters with Mr. Bond: Vera Leola Bond (1909-1989) m. Leslie Baltar Grant (1908-1986) and Willamene L. Bond (b. 1912).\nManager in 1922\nR. Hart Chinn was elected Mayor of Biloxi at the August 25, 1933 general election. In the Democratic primary held earlier, Mayor Chinn ran against Walter H. Hunt and Dr. G.F. Carroll.\nAt a City Council meeting on August 22, 1934, Mayor R. Hart Chinn struck City Commission John A. Swanzy (1881-) in the head with a\nRunning for Biloxi's mayorial office were: Dr. A. Ferrer; Jacinto Baltar; Dr. G.F. Carroll; and Hart Chinn. Louis Staehling had dropped out in late July.\nR. Hart Chinn ran for the U.S. Congress in 1936. Was to speak with J.S. Easterling of Laurel at KC Bazaar in front of BYC in July 1936.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMayor of Biloxi from 19-19.\nJohn W. Aloysius O\u2019 Keefe (1891-1985) was born at New Orleans on February 24, 1891, the son of Jeremiah J. O\u2019Keefe (1860-1911) and Alice Cahill (1864-1921).\nAttended local schools and the Jesuit College at New Orleans. In 1901, promoted from first sergeant to first lieutenant in the Jesuit Cadets.(\nJohn A. O\u2019Keefe married Amelia \u201cNicki\u201d Castanera (1905-2000), the daughter of Captain Frank B. Castanera (1870-1934) and Amelia Desporte (1880-1953), in December 1929. Amelia Castenera was the Queen of Les Masques, a Biloxi Mardi Gras krewe, in 1927, and taught school at Biloxi.( In 1937, John and Nicki O\u2019Keefe adopted a Jackson, Mississippi born baby girl and named her Patricia Mary O\u2019Keefe (1937-2009). Patricia M. O\u2019Keefe was born on September 27, 1937. She was a graduate of the Immaculate Seminary at Washiington D.C. and a 1959 graduate of Chestnut Hill College at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Patricia married Ensign Badger Conley Smith III on July 4, 1959 in the Walter Reed Memorial Chapel at Washington D.C. Ensign Smith had graduated from St. John's College, Washington D.C. and the US Naval Academy in 1959.(The Daily Herald, July 8, 1959, p. 8) Patrica Mary O'Keefe married Frank O\u2019 Brimski in May 1965.

The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger\u2019s causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nStroke is the second-leading cause of death and a major cause disability worldwide (Feigin, 2021) and, in particular, ischemic stroke constituted 62.4% of all new strokes in 2019. Focal stroke lesions affecting either cortical and sub-cortical neurons or descending fiber tracts may affect the neural processing in the motor network (Ward and Cohen, 2004; Stinear et al., 2007). This leads to motor deficit, mainly caused by hemiparesis, that is one of the most common stroke-related disabilities (Katan and Luft, 2018). Nevertheless, it has been observed that patients with initially mild to moderate motor impairments may show substantial recovery of the motor function within the first 3 months after stroke onset. This may be driven by neural plasticity and reorganization, which can occur in the brain also far from the lesion site (Nudo, 2006; Cramer, 2008; Rehme and Grefkes, 2013).\n\nTo investigate cortical functional reorganization, connectivity models based on the concept that the brain is organized in specialized anatomically distinct areas functionally integrated in networks (Friston, 2002) were applied to neuroimaging techniques, both in experimental and computational simulation studies (Falcon et al., 2016; Allegra Mascaro et al., 2020). Functional connectivity is usually inferred by means of correlations among measurements of neuronal activity neglecting information on the coupling direction, whereas the directed functional connectivity investigates the causal influence that a brain region exerts over another (Friston, 2011; Barrett and Barnett, 2013). In the literature, the analysis of cortical directed and undirected functional connectivity has been extensively used to characterize the brain connections and investigate rehabilitation effects on patients after stroke events (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Connectivity studies can be carried out during both task and resting state conditions, the latter being the easiest protocol executable also for patients in the acute stage. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that changes in resting state connectivity, especially in the motor network, are predictive of motor function recovery in stroke patients (James et al., 2009; Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Volz et al., 2016; Hordacre et al., 2020).\n\nAmong neuroimaging techniques, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was one of the first employed to investigate brain connectivity. Given its high spatial resolution and the provided volumetric information, fMRI allows investigation of connections involving both cortical and deep structures in the brain (Farr and Wegener, 2010). Electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed as a valid alternative technique, as it allowed to reconstruct known resting state networks from signals acquired by scalp electrodes in healthy subjects (Mantini et al., 2007). Despite its lower spatial resolution, EEG offers a higher time resolution with respect to fMRI, allowing to better track the fast reconfiguration of neuronal networks and to extract information on the spectral characteristics of the functional networks related to specific brain rhythms. Moreover, it exploits cheaper and portable instrumentation, allowing measurements both on healthy and pathological subjects, also accessible in complex medical setting (Borich et al., 2015).\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, a plethora of measures and indexes have been proposed to infer both functional and causal connectivity from EEG recordings (Pereda et al., 2005), including bivariate and conditional Granger causality (GC), transfer entropy (TE), directed transfer function (DTF), directed coherence (DC), partial directed coherence (PDC) and dynamical Bayesian inference. Each of these metrics may be sensitive to different aspects of the neurophysiological data, evidenced either in time or frequency domains or through linear or non-linear relationships. Therefore, the choice of a metric over another depends on the particular aspect of interest in the connectivity network; moreover, the reliability of a specific metric can depend on different factors related to the specific application, such as the stationarity of the signal, non-linear effects or indirect connections among networks nodes. Different causal connectivity metrics can lead to different results and careful interpretation is required. Usually, only one metric is chosen to retrieve networks\u2019 topology and infer the spectral content of the information flow between network nodes. However, the use of a single metric cannot guarantee a comprehensive description of the network (Blinowska, 2011). For instance, GC and TE provide compact information on the overall information flow between network nodes, while DTF, DC and PDC focus on specific rhythms of physiological interest (Sameshima and Baccal\u00e1, 2014; Seth et al., 2015); bivariate GC\/TE and DC detect the overall flow of information from one node to another, while conditional GC\/TE and DTF\/PDC elicit direct connections but may lose ability to capture the coupling strength (Faes et al., 2012). Finally, the dynamical Bayesian inference approach has been proposed to assess the cross-frequency coupling strength both in neural networks and among different physiological systems, e.g., cardio-respiratory-cortical interactions (Stankovski et al., 2016). Until now, an agreed standard measure to assess EEG-based causal connectivity is not univocally employed in the literature, and the selection of the most appropriate measure still represents an open issue.\n\nMoreover, in the context of EEG analysis, causal connectivity was often identified directly from the electrodes signal, but it has been demonstrated that connectivity computed in the electrode space is affected by the scalp volume-conduction effect and the obtained results can be hardly interpreted as real brain connectivity (Hassan and Wendling, 2018; Marinazzo et al., 2019; Van de Steen et al., 2019). On the contrary, meaningful connectivity patterns can be derived from cortical source activities extracted from EEG inverse solutions (Michel and Murray, 2012; Haufe et al., 2013).\n\nAlthough the effects of stroke on resting-state brain connectivity have been widely investigated, especially in the acute phase with respect to healthy subjects, a limited number of works focused specifically on longitudinal effects of motor rehabilitation on the reorganization of the cortical motor network after stroke. Moreover, the majority of studies exploited fMRI to assess functional, non-directed connectivity (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Considering EEG analysis, up to now, the majority of studies explored functional connectivity in post-stroke populations in both acute (Caliandro et al., 2017; Vecchio et al., 2019a, 2019b; Fanciullacci et al., 2021; Hoshino et al., 2021) and chronic stages (Gerloff et al., 2006; De Vico Fallani et al., 2009, 2017; Wu et al., 2015; Hordacre et al., 2020; Molteni et al., 2020; Waterstone et al., 2020; Romeo et al., 2021); only fewer studies investigated the resting-state causal connectivity after stroke (Guo et al., 2014; Pichiorri et al., 2015, 2018; Calabr\u00f2 et al., 2018; Nicolo et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021). The few studies cited above employing EEG rarely focused on the investigation of the motor network, preferring a large-scale connectivity analysis of the whole brain with synthetic descriptors. Even though this type of information can serve as a general indication on the state of brain\u2019s connections after stroke, information about power spectral strength or flow direction in the identified connections are often missing. This type of information can be obtained by separate connectivity metrics computed from electrodes or brain sources signals and whose underlying interpretation should be carefully considered to compare the results between different studies.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, the investigation of motor network directed functional connectivity by means of EEG in sub-acute stroke patients should be deepened from both methodological and application perspectives. To this aim, in this work we perform an EEG-based longitudinal study of resting-state causal connectivity in a population of sub-acute stroke patients with motor impairment who underwent a rehabilitation treatment. We focus on the characterization of the motor network exploiting the cortical source signals reconstructed from EEG scalp recordings and using two different connectivity metrics, i.e., the Directed Coherence (DC) and the generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Combining the information carried by these two measures, we aim to provide a description of the variations induced by treatment in both the topography and the transfer of spectral power along the identified functional connections, investigating also possible correlations with the clinical assessment of motor recovery.\n\nIn Section 2, a detailed description of the participants enrolled for this study and the methodology followed is presented. In Section 3, the obtained results are reported and their discussion can be found in Section 4. Section 5 draws conclusions of the work.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1 Population Description\n\nEighteen subjects (age 67 \u00b1 10, seven females and 11 males) in the sub-acute stage after ischemic stroke were enrolled for this study. Inclusion criteria were age less than 80 years old, first unilateral stroke, distance from acute event less than 30 days, with no other concomitant orthopedic or rheumatologic disease, without global or comprehension aphasia, right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. Each subject was evaluated twice: firstly, at the admission to the rehabilitation center (T0, on average after 12 \u00b1 5 days from the stroke event) and secondly at the end of the rehabilitation treatment (T1, on average after 55 \u00b1 11 days from the event). In Table 1, details about participants\u2019 characteristics are reported. To participate, each subject signed a written informed consent. The study was reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee \u201cComitato Etico Provinciale dell\u2019Insubria\u201d and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nPatients followed a rehabilitation treatment for both upper and lower limb recovery: each patient underwent to a rehabilitation treatment twice per day, each session lasting 45 min. Training was tailored according to patients\u2019 residuals motor capacity and it included exercise for upper and lower limbs. Lower and upper limbs stretching, lower and upper limbs muscle strengthening, static and dynamic balance exercises, proprioception exercises, trunk control exercise, gait at the parallel bars or in clinical open spaces were the exercise performed.\n\n### 2.2 Functional Assessment\n\nClinical evaluations were performed by clinicians, i.e., physiotherapist and medical doctor. To assess the upper limb performance the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) (Fugl-Meyer et al., 1975) before and after treatment was used. The FMA motor score ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 66 (upper limb normal motor performance). As for the lower limb, the level of walking ability was assessed by the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC). This gait assessment scale distinguishes six levels of walking ability based on the amount of physical support required. The lowest level 0 indicates a patient who is not able to walk, while level 5, indicates a patient who can walk everywhere independently, including stairs (Holden et al., 1984). Participants\u2019 scores assigned at T0 and T1 for both clinical scales, i.e., FMAT0, FMAT1, FAC T0 and FAC T1, are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe variations \u0394FMA = FMAT1\u2013FMAT0 and \u0394FAC = FACT1\u2013FACT0 was considered as primary clinical outcomes of subject\u2019s motor recovery.\n\n### 2.3 EEG Data Acquisition\n\nResting state EEG recordings were performed with the Neuroscan system (Compumedics Neuroscan, Compumedics, NC, United States) using 64 Ag\/AgCl electrodes placed according to the International 10\/20 standard system. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz, with the reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz positions and the ground electrode positioned anterior to Fz. During the acquisition, patients were asked to keep their eyes closed in a sitting relaxed position for at least 5 min. As for functional assessment, EEG recordings were repeated twice, before (T0) and after (T1) the rehabilitation treatment.\n\n### 2.4 EEG Data Analysis\n\nIn Figure 1, a scheme of the principal steps followed for the analysis of single EEG recordings is reported. Three main stages can be identified: EEG signal pre-processing, current sources reconstruction and directed functional connectivity. In the scheme, inputs and outputs of each block are highlighted. Detailed explanation of each step is provided in the following sections.\n\n**FIGURE 1**. Pipeline of single acquisition and analysis. Abbreviations: MVAR, multivariate auto-regressive; DC, Directed Coherence; gPDC, generalized partial directed coherence.\n\n##### 2.4.1 EEG Pre-Processing\n\nEEG signals were pre-processed offline in Matlab environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) using the open source EEGLab signal processing Toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).\n\nData were down-sampled at 128 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 45 Hz to remove slow drifts and high-frequency components, such as the power line noise. Flat and \u201cbad\u201d channels were removed for further analysis. A flat channel was identified if it showed amplitude around zero (flatline) for more than 5 s consecutively, whereas a channel was identified as \u201cbad\u201d if it was noisy for more than 90% of the acquisition duration. An Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm (Mullen et al., 2015) was applied to all retained channels to identify and remove transient or high-amplitude artifacts, e.g., eye movements. According to Chang and others (Chang et al., 2020), the application of this cleaning approach improves the accuracy of subsequent Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The ASR algorithm automatically identifies clean periods of the EEG data using a sliding window. An artifact rejection threshold is calculated, based on the calibration signal distribution of variance and a user-defined cut-off parameter. Data portions, whose variance is larger than this threshold, are removed and reconstructed from neighboring channels using a covariance matrix computed from the calibration data. According to the cut-off parameter *k* chosen by the user, the method can be more or less aggressive in removing EEG components portions of data. In this work, *k* = 20 was employed, according to the range suggested by Chang and others, who validated the ASR method on real EEG data and found that a *k* in the range 10\u2013100 allows removing ocular artifacts still preserving cerebral components (Chang et al., 2020). Furthermore, ICA was applied to the ASR-cleaned EEG recordings exploiting the RUNICA Infomax algorithm as implemented in EEGLab (Makeig and Bell, 1996). RUNICA un-mixes the EEG recordings in cortical and non-cortical spatially distinct and temporally independent components (IC). Once the non-cortical components are identified and removed, the final cleaned EEG signal can be reconstructed. To guide the selection of ICs accounting for non-brain (artifactual) activities the ICLabel plugin was employed (Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019). It is an automated classifier which provides an estimation of the type of each of the IC (brain, eye, muscle, line noise, etc.) based on some component characteristics, i.e., power spectrum, its time-course, topography dipole localization and percentage data variance accounted in the considered component. A final visual check of the signals was performed. The originally removed \u201cbad\u201d channels were then reconstructed by the interpolation of the neighbor channels signals, thus obtaining a uniform EEG spatial sampling. Finally, EEG data were re-referenced to a common average reference and 1 min of cleaned, artifact-free 60 channels EEG was selected for all subjects.\n\n##### 2.4.2 Individual Alpha Frequency\n\nTo improve the accuracy of the EEG analysis in the frequency domain, the interindividual variability of the alpha rhythm peak was considered for the determination of the spectral bands of interest, as proposed by Klimesch in 1999 (Klimesch, 1999). In particular, for the purpose of this study, we focused our analysis on alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands, which are reported as the most involved in motor system functions (Pfurtscheller et al., 1994, 1996). After computing the power spectral density (PSD) for the parieto-occipital channels by the Welch method (Welch, 1967), the Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF) was determined as the average peak position in the spectral range 7.5\u201312.5 Hz. The average IAF found in our population was equal to 9.07 \u00b1 0.99 Hz. The IAF was used to define the alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands as follow: \u03b1 = [IAF-2 Hz \u00f7 IAF+2 Hz] and \u03b2 = [IAF+2.5 Hz \u00f7 IA\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_ed559afb6c07478d8c1ec691\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Resting State EEG Directed Functional Connectivity Unveils Changes in Motor Network Organization in Subacute Stroke Patients After Rehabilitation\\\\\\\" authors affiliations\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Cortical connectivity in stroke using signals from resting- ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/Cortical-connectivity-in-stroke-using-signals-from-Bistriceanu-Danciu\/ef9693140bc37f0dd0732c2149e628de067419cd\n+6 authors ...

The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger\u2019s causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n\n**Keywords:** EEG, brain sources, causal connectivity, partial direct coherence, directed coherence, stroke, subacute, motor network\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nStroke is the second-leading cause of death and a major cause disability worldwide (Feigin, 2021) and, in particular, ischemic stroke constituted 62.4% of all new strokes in 2019. Focal stroke lesions affecting either cortical and sub-cortical neurons or descending fiber tracts may affect the neural processing in the motor network (Ward and Cohen, 2004; Stinear et al., 2007). This leads to motor deficit, mainly caused by hemiparesis, that is one of the most common stroke-related disabilities (Katan and Luft, 2018). Nevertheless, it has been observed that patients with initially mild to moderate motor impairments may show substantial recovery of the motor function within the first 3 months after stroke onset. This may be driven by neural plasticity and reorganization, which can occur in the brain also far from the lesion site (Nudo, 2006; Cramer, 2008; Rehme and Grefkes, 2013).\n\nTo investigate cortical functional reorganization, connectivity models based on the concept that the brain is organized in specialized anatomically distinct areas functionally integrated in networks (Friston, 2002) were applied to neuroimaging techniques, both in experimental and computational simulation studies (Falcon et al., 2016; Allegra Mascaro et al., 2020). Functional connectivity is usually inferred by means of correlations among measurements of neuronal activity neglecting information on the coupling direction, whereas the directed functional connectivity investigates the causal influence that a brain region exerts over another (Friston, 2011; Barrett and Barnett, 2013). In the literature, the analysis of cortical directed and undirected functional connectivity has been extensively used to characterize the brain connections and investigate rehabilitation effects on patients after stroke events (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Connectivity studies can be carried out during both task and resting state conditions, the latter being the easiest protocol executable also for patients in the acute stage. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that changes in resting state connectivity, especially in the motor network, are predictive of motor function recovery in stroke patients (James et al., 2009; Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Volz et al., 2016; Hordacre et al., 2020).\n\nAmong neuroimaging techniques, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was one of the first employed to investigate brain connectivity. Given its high spatial resolution and the provided volumetric information, fMRI allows investigation of connections involving both cortical and deep structures in the brain (Farr and Wegener, 2010). Electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed as a valid alternative technique, as it allowed to reconstruct known resting state networks from signals acquired by scalp electrodes in healthy subjects (Mantini et al., 2007). Despite its lower spatial resolution, EEG offers a higher time resolution with respect to fMRI, allowing to better track the fast reconfiguration of neuronal networks and to extract information on the spectral characteristics of the functional networks related to specific brain rhythms. Moreover, it exploits cheaper and portable instrumentation, allowing measurements both on healthy and pathological subjects, also accessible in complex medical setting (Borich et al., 2015).\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, a plethora of measures and indexes have been proposed to infer both functional and causal connectivity from EEG recordings (Pereda et al., 2005), including bivariate and conditional Granger causality (GC), transfer entropy (TE), directed transfer function (DTF), directed coherence (DC), partial directed coherence (PDC) and dynamical Bayesian inference. Each of these metrics may be sensitive to different aspects of the neurophysiological data, evidenced either in time or frequency domains or through linear or non-linear relationships. Therefore, the choice of a metric over another depends on the particular aspect of interest in the connectivity network; moreover, the reliability of a specific metric can depend on different factors related to the specific application, such as the stationarity of the signal, non-linear effects or indirect connections among networks nodes. Different causal connectivity metrics can lead to different results and careful interpretation is required. Usually, only one metric is chosen to retrieve networks\u2019 topology and infer the spectral content of the information flow between network nodes. However, the use of a single metric cannot guarantee a comprehensive description of the network (Blinowska, 2011). For instance, GC and TE provide compact information on the overall information flow between network nodes, while DTF, DC and PDC focus on specific rhythms of physiological interest (Sameshima and Baccal\u00e1, 2014; Seth et al., 2015); bivariate GC\/TE and DC detect the overall flow of information from one node to another, while conditional GC\/TE and DTF\/PDC elicit direct connections but may lose ability to capture the coupling strength (Faes et al., 2012). Finally, the dynamical Bayesian inference approach has been proposed to assess the cross-frequency coupling strength both in neural networks and among different physiological systems, e.g., cardio-respiratory-cortical interactions (Stankovski et al., 2016). Until now, an agreed standard measure to assess EEG-based causal connectivity is not univocally employed in the literature, and the selection of the most appropriate measure still represents an open issue.\n\nMoreover, in the context of EEG analysis, causal connectivity was often identified directly from the electrodes signal, but it has been demonstrated that connectivity computed in the electrode space is affected by the scalp volume-conduction effect and the obtained results can be hardly interpreted as real brain connectivity (Hassan and Wendling, 2018; Marinazzo et al., 2019; Van de Steen et al., 2019). On the contrary, meaningful connectivity patterns can be derived from cortical source activities extracted from EEG inverse solutions (Michel and Murray, 2012; Haufe et al., 2013).\n\nAlthough the effects of stroke on resting-state brain connectivity have been widely investigated, especially in the acute phase with respect to healthy subjects, a limited number of works focused specifically on longitudinal effects of motor rehabilitation on the reorganization of the cortical motor network after stroke. Moreover, the majority of studies exploited fMRI to assess functional, non-directed connectivity (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Considering EEG analysis, up to now, the majority of studies explored functional connectivity in post-stroke populations in both acute (Caliandro et al., 2017; Vecchio et al., 2019a, 2019b; Fanciullacci et al., 2021; Hoshino et al., 2021) and chronic stages (Gerloff et al., 2006; De Vico Fallani et al., 2009, 2017; Wu et al., 2015; Hordacre et al., 2020; Molteni et al., 2020; Waterstone et al., 2020; Romeo et al., 2021); only fewer studies investigated the resting-state causal connectivity after stroke (Guo et al., 2014; Pichiorri et al., 2015, 2018; Calabr\u00f2 et al., 2018; Nicolo et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021). The few studies cited above employing EEG rarely focused on the investigation of the motor network, preferring a large-scale connectivity analysis of the whole brain with synthetic descriptors. Even though this type of information can serve as a general indication on the state of brain\u2019s connections after stroke, information about power spectral strength or flow direction in the identified connections are often missing. This type of information can be obtained by separate connectivity metrics computed from electrodes or brain sources signals and whose underlying interpretation should be carefully considered to compare the results between different studies.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, the investigation of motor network directed functional connectivity by means of EEG in sub-acute stroke patients should be deepened from both methodological and application perspectives. To this aim, in this work we perform an EEG-based longitudinal study of resting-state causal connectivity in a population of sub-acute stroke patients with motor impairment who underwent a rehabilitation treatment. We focus on the characterization of the motor network exploiting the cortical source signals reconstructed from EEG scalp recordings and using two different connectivity metrics, i.e., the Directed Coherence (DC) and the generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Combining the information carried by these two measures, we aim to provide a description of the variations induced by treatment in both the topography and the transfer of spectral power along the identified functional connections, investigating also possible correlations with the clinical assessment of motor recovery.\n\nIn Section 2, a detailed description of the participants enrolled for this study and the methodology followed is presented. In Section 3, the obtained results are reported and their discussion can be found in Section 4. Section 5 draws conclusions of the work.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1 Population Description\n\nEighteen subjects (age 67 \u00b1 10, seven females and 11 males) in the sub-acute stage after ischemic stroke were enrolled for this study. Inclusion criteria were age less than 80 years old, first unilateral stroke, distance from acute event less than 30 days, with no other concomitant orthopedic or rheumatologic disease, without global or comprehension aphasia, right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. Each subject was evaluated twice: firstly, at the admission to the rehabilitation center (T0, on average after 12 \u00b1 5 days from the stroke event) and secondly at the end of the rehabilitation treatment (T1, on average after 55 \u00b1 11 days from the event). In Table 1, details about participants\u2019 characteristics are reported. To participate, each subject signed a written informed consent. The study was reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee \u201cComitato Etico Provinciale dell\u2019Insubria\u201d and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n#### TABLE 1.\n\n| Subject\u2019s ID | Age (years) | Gender | Lesion side\/location | T0 (days) | T1 (days) | FMAT0\n|\nFMA T1\n|\nFACT0\n|\nFAC T1\n|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 65 | M | L frontal CS | 14 | 42 | 54 | 66 | 1 | 5 |\n| 2 | 61 | M | L pons | 9 | 55 | 0 | 48 | 0 | 2 |\n| 3 | 65 | F | R internal capsule | 6 | 49 | 38 | 60 | 4 | 4 |\n| 4 | 81 | F | R paramedian pons | 7 | 49 | 4 | 48 | 0 | 2 |\n| 5 | 70 | M | R centrum semiovale | 8 | 50 | 45 | 58 | 0 | 3 |\n| 6 | 81 | M | R lacunar | 8 | 57 | 44 | 66 | 1 | 5 |\n| 7 | 53 | M | R median cerebral artery | 17 | 89 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 |\n| 8 | 74 | F | R cerebellum | 20 | 66 | 44 | 52 | 2 | 3 |\n| 9 | 80 | M | L lacunar | 11 | 53 | 24 | 56 | 4 | 5 |\n| 10 | 78 | M | R internal capsule | 7 | 51 | 0 | 7 | 0 | 1 |\n| 11 | 72 | F | L fronto-parietal | 12 | 61 | 42 | 62 | 0 | 3 |\n| 12 | 76 | M | R Sylvian\/posterior artery | 10 | 48 | 6 | 66 | 1 | 4 |\n| 13 | 52 | M | L fronto-parietal | 12 | 44 | 47 | 66 | 2 | 4 |\n| 14 | 65 | F | L Pons | 27 | 72 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| 15 | 56 | F | R frontal\/basal ganglia | 11 | 53 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 |\n| 16 | 63 | M | R Pons | 7 | 47 | 38 | 53 | 0 | 3 |\n| 17 | 59 | F | L median cerebral artery | 10 | 58 | 38 | 49 | 1 | 3 |\n| 18 | 54 | M | R bulbous pyramid | 12 | 49 | 12 | 57 | 0 | 4 |\n\nAbbreviations: F, female; M, male; R, right; L, left; CS, cortico-subcortical; FMA, Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale; FAC, Functional Ambulation Category.\n\nPatients followed a rehabilitation treatment for both upper and lower limb recovery: each patient underwent to a rehabilitation treatment twice per day, each session lasting 45 min. Training was tailored according to patients\u2019 residuals motor capacity and it included exercise for upper and lower limbs. Lower and upper limbs stretching, lower and upper limbs muscle strengthening, static and dynamic balance exercises, proprioception exercises, trunk control exercise, gait at the parallel bars or in clinical open spaces were the exercise performed.\n\n### 2.2 Functional Assessment\n\nClinical evaluations were performed by clinicians, i.e., physiotherapist and medical doctor. To assess the upper limb performance the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) (Fugl-Meyer et al., 1975) before and after treatment was used. The FMA motor score ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 66 (upper limb normal motor performance). As for the lower limb, the level of walking ability was assessed by the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC). This gait assessment scale distinguishes six levels of walking ability based on the amount of physical support required. The lowest level 0 indicates a patient who is not able to walk, while level 5, indicates a patient who can walk everywhere independently, including stairs (Holden et al., 1984). Participants\u2019 scores assigned at T0 and T1 for both clinical scales, i.e., FMAT0, FMAT1, FAC T0 and FAC T1, are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe variations \u0394FMA = FMAT1\u2013FMAT0 and \u0394FAC = FACT1\u2013FACT0 was considered as primary clinical outcomes of subject\u2019s motor recovery.\n\n### 2.3 EEG Data Acquisition\n\nResting state EEG recordings were performed with the Neuroscan system (Compumedics Neuroscan, Compumedics, NC, United States) using 64 Ag\/AgCl electrodes placed according to the International 10\/20 standard system. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz, with the reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz positions and the ground electrode positioned anterior to Fz. During the acquisition, patients were asked to keep their eyes closed in a sitting relaxed position for at least 5 min. As for functional assessment, EEG recordings were repeated twice, before (T0) and after (T1) the rehabilitation treatment.\n\n### 2.4 EEG Data Analysis\n\nIn Figure 1, a scheme of the principal steps followed for the analysis of single EEG recordings is reported. Three main stages can be identified: EEG signal pre-processing, current sources reconstruction and directed functional connectivity. In the scheme, inputs and outputs of each block are highlighted. Detailed explanation of each step is provided in the following sections.\n\n#### 2.4.1 EEG Pre-Processing\n\nEEG signals were pre-processed offline in Matlab environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) using the open source EEGLab signal processing Toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).\n\nData were down-sampled at 128 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 45 Hz to remove slow drifts and high-frequency components, such as the power line noise. Flat and \u201cbad\u201d channels were removed for further analysis. A flat channel was identified if it showed amplitude around zero (flatline) for more than 5 s consecutively, whereas a channel was identified as \u201cbad\u201d if it was noisy for more than 90% of the acquisition duration. An Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm (Mullen et al., 2015) was applied to all retained channels to identify and remove transient or high-amplitude artifacts, e.g., eye movements. According to Chang and others (Chang et al., 2020), the application of this cleaning approach improves the accuracy of subsequent Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The ASR algorithm automatically identifies clean periods of the EEG data using a sliding window. An artifact rejection threshold is calculated, based on the calibration signal distribution of variance and a user-defined cut-off parameter. Data portions, whose variance is larger than this threshold, are removed and reconstructed from neighboring channels using a covariance matrix computed from the calibration data. According to the cut-off parameter *k* chosen by the user, the method can be more or less aggressive in removing EEG components portions of data. In this work, *k* = 20 was employed, according to the range suggested by Chang and others, who validated the ASR method on real EEG data and found that a *k* in the range 10\u2013100 allows removing ocular artifacts still preserving cerebral components (Chang et al., 2020). Furthermore, ICA was applied to the ASR-cleaned EEG recordings exploiting the RUNICA Infomax algorithm as implemented in EEGLab (Makeig and Bell, 1996). RUNICA un-mixes the EEG recordings in cortical and non-cortical spatially distinct and temporally independent components (IC). Once the non-cortical components are identified and removed, the final cleaned EEG signal can be reconstructed. To guide the selection of ICs accounting for non-brain (artifactual) activities the ICLabel plugin was employed (Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019). It is an automated classifier which provides an estimation of the type of each of the IC (brain, eye, muscle, line noise, etc.) based on some component characteristics, i.e., power spectrum, its time-course, topography dipole localization and percentage data variance accounted in the considered component. A final visual check of the signals was performed. The originally removed \u201cbad\u201d channels were then reconstructed by the interpolation of th\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Based on my comprehensive search and analysis, I have definitively identified the exact title of the physiological study that matches all the specified criteria:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Resting State EEG Directed Functional Connectivity Unveils Changes in Motor Network Organization in Subacute Stroke Patients After Rehabilitation}}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":86310.6830120087,"scoring_ms":335.5140686035,"total_ms":86646.1970806122,"info":{"raw_question":"Identify the full title of a recent physiological study (circa 2022) focused on brain plasticity following ischemic events.

The now defunct MSE was the fourth stock exchange to be established in the country and the first in South India.[1] It had a turnover (2001) of \u20b9 3,090 crore ($440 million), but was a fraction (below 3.5 per cent) of the turnover generated by the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India. The turnover of the stock exchange was 19,907 Crore as of the financial year 2012.[2][3][4]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The Madras Stock Exchange Association (Private) Ltd. was registered on August 12, 1937. The first five founding member companies were Paterson & Co, Kothari & Co, Dalal & Co, Maconochie & Co and India Brokers\u2019.[5]\n\nThe Madras Stock Exchange Association (Private) Limited had been registered under the Indian Companies Act of 1913. After the coming into force of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, which enactment was passed to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business of dealing therein, by prohibiting auctions and for providing for certain other matters, the Company - Madras Stock Exchange Limited was incorporated on the 29th day of April, 1957.[6]\n\nWhen the Securities Contracts Regulation Act came into force in October 1957, the Madras Stock Exchange Association was converted into a company limited by guarantee under the Companies Act 1956. Membership of the Stock Exchange was also changed from firms to individuals, and the partners of the firms functioning at that time became individual members of the Stock Exchange.[7]\n\nIn 1996, the MSE was fully computerised and online trading became operational, as the MSE was connected to 120 broking offices in and around Chennai through wide area networking. On 14 May 2015, SEBI permitted Madras stock exchange to exit.[8] The Madras Stock Exchange ceased to exist on May 30, 2015.[9]\n\nAfter surrendering its license, MSE was rechristened Madras Enterprises Ltd and continues to trade as a sub broker to BSE and NSE.[10]\n\n## List of Former Presidents\n\n[edit]Madras Stock Exchange - Past Presidents[11]\n\n| Name | Company name | Year | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | C.

Krishnaswami & Co | 1950\u20131951 |\n\n## Functions\n\n[edit]The MSE had about 120 live members and 1,785 companies listed. The exchange followed the Rolling Settlement system, as per the January 2000 SEBI (Securities Exchange Board of India) guidelines and a proactive Grievance Cell is operational. By this system, investors could log in their complaints, for which a number was given for further reference, through which investors could keep track of the action taken by the exchange as regards their complaint.\n\nA subsidiary company - MSE Financial Services Ltd, had been established. A member of the Bombay Stock Exchange, MSE Financial Services did help to create greater broker and investor flexibility through multi-market access. The members were able to trade in both BSE and MSE. This was followed up with National Stock Exchange (NSE) membership.\n\nTrading on the exchange took place from 10.00 am to 3.30 pm.\n\n## Merging\n\n[edit]As per June 2012 notification from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), whereby individual stock exchanges should maintain a minimum liquid net worth of \u20b9 1,000 million and exchanges that do not comply with this requirement should close down their operations by June 2015, the Bangalore Stock Exchange (BgSE) decided to merge with the Madras Stock Exchange. The combined entity became the single largest regional exchange in the country with over 1,000 local companies listed exclusively on it. BgSE and MSE together had a liquid net worth of around \u20b9 500 million while another \u20b9 500 million will be raised by liquidating certain idle assets (situated in Bangalore and Chennai) of these exchanges.[12][13][14]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- List of stock exchanges in the Commonwealth of Nations\n- List of South Asian stock exchanges\n- Economy of Chennai\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**Madras Stock Exchange Ltd - About Us**^**\"Madras Stock Exchange plans to raise Rs 100 crore\"**^**\"Madras Stock Exchange to offer platform for MSMEs\"**^**\"Madras Stock Exchange plans to raise Rs 100 crore from PEs, IPO\"**^**\"75 years of stock broking\".**^**\"The Madras High Court - Court case\".**^**\"A BRIEF PROFILE OF MACONOCHIE & CO\".**^**Narasimhan, T E (17 May 2015). \"Sebi permits Madras Stock Exchange to exit business\".*Business Standard*.

It is owned and operated by the City of Laredo and the Secretar\u00eda de Comunicaciones y Transportes (Mexico's federal Secretariat of Communication and Transportation). It is also known as **Laredo International Bridge 1**.\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]The Gateway to the Americas International Bridge is a four-lane bridge with two pedestrian walkways and is 1,050 feet (320 m) long and 42 feet (13 m) wide. The bridge is also known as the Convent Street Bridge, Laredo International Bridge, Bridge Number One, Old Bridge, Laredo-Nuevo Laredo Bridge 1, Puente Nuevo Laredo, Puente Laredo I, and Puente Viejo.[3]\n\n## Location\n\n[edit]This bridge is located in the San Agustin Historical District in Downtown Laredo on the United States Side and on the northern terminus of Mexican Federal Highway 85 in downtown Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. It operates 24 hours a day for pedestrian traffic from and to Mexico. Renovations at the bridge lasting from April 2016 to October 2017 are finished and vehicular transit is resumed.\n\n## Border crossing\n\n[edit]The Laredo Convent Avenue Port of Entry is located at the Gateway to the Americas International Bridge.[4] Since 1889, a bridge connected Laredo, Texas with Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas at this location. For many years, this was the only crossing for vehicular and pedestrian traffic between the two cities.\n\nThe U.S. Inspection Station building that was built in 1943 was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\n\nSince 2018, all vehicles crossing from Mexico to the U.S. through this bridge is now for SENTRI holders only. All other vehicles have to cross through the Ju\u00e1rez\u2013Lincoln International Bridge or through the Laredo\u2013Colombia Solidarity International Bridge. Pedestrial crossing remains unchanged.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The original bridge was constructed in the 1880s in a through truss design, the original Laredo International Foot Bridge was destroyed April 28, 1905 by a flood. It was repaired and again totally destroyed by flood on September 3, 1932. The city of Laredo and the Mexican government rebuilt the bridge to accommodate vehicles in 1932, surviving 22 years before it was destroyed again by flood in 1954.\nThe current bridge was constructed in 1954 and operational in 1956, has survived flooding with no damage and remains operational. The city of Laredo purchased the American side of the international bridge for $695,000 in 1946 from a private owner.[3]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a**\"City of Laredo International Bridge System Toll Rates\" (PDF).

The 1932 bridge was the first permanent vehicle-capable bridge at this crossing, and it operated until destroyed by flood in 1954.\n\nBut the Gateway to the Americas International Bridge page clearly states the current bridge was constructed in 1954 and operational in 1956. Given that the riddle asks for the inaugural operational year of the bilateral structure, and considering the context of the Gateway to the Americas being the permanent engineered structure that replaced earlier versions, the answer appears to be 1956.\n\nHowever, let me verify if there was an earlier permanent bridge. The text mentions \"Since 1889, a bridge connected Laredo, Texas with Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas at this location\" but this was likely a smaller pedestrian bridge.

For many years, this was the only crossing for vehicular and pedestrian traffic between the two cities.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]In 1889, eight years after the first railroad bridge was constructed connecting two cities, the \"Foot and Wagon Bridge\" was built, enabling pedestrians and horse-drawn carriages to cross the border.[2] This bridge was destroyed by a tornado and subsequent flood in 1905, and again by a mysterious fire in 1920. It was destroyed again by floods in 1932 and 1954.[3] During each reconstruction, temporary pontoon bridges were built to accommodate traffic. The current bridge was completed in 1955. The construction of the Amistad Dam in 1969 has mitigated the effect of subsequent flooding conditions. It wasn't until 1976 that a second bridge was built to further connect the two cities.\n\nThe U.S. Inspection Station building that was built in 1943 was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- List of Mexico\u2013United States border crossings\n- List of Canada\u2013United States border crossings\n- National Register of Historic Places listings in Webb County, Texas\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Gateway to the Americas Bridge \u2013 The History of Laredo\".*Texas Department of Transportation*.

Susenyos was the son of Emperor Sarsa Dengel, making him the son of a recognized sovereign (the Ethiopian emperor).\n\n**Step 3: The chiefly group's distinct musical heritage**\nEthiopian traditional music is known for unique vocal methods and specific instruments like the masinko, krar, washint, begena, and kebero. This represents the distinct musical heritage of Susenyos's people.\n\n**Step 4: The influential band founder and musical expert**\nMulatu Astatke emerged as the Ethiopian musician who founded Ethio-jazz and became an expert in broader continental musical practices. He trained in London, New York City, and Boston, blending Ethiopian music with jazz and Latin music.\n\n**Step 5: The continental practices borrowing from island nation**\nMulatu Astatke's work heavily incorporated Latin American influences, particularly percussion instruments like the vibraphone and conga drums that he introduced to Ethiopian music. This points to Puerto Rico as the island nation with musical traditions blending string and percussion elements.\n\n**Step 6: The notable wind instrumentalist and composer who departed**\nRafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn fits this description perfectly.

Among his most famous compositions are \"Lamento Borincano,\u201d \"Capullito de alhel\u00ed,\u201d \"Campanitas de cristal,\u201d \"Cachita,\u201d \"Silencio,\u201d \"El cumbanchero,\u201d \"Ausencia,\u201d and \"Perfume de gardenias.\u201d\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]### Early years\n\n[edit]Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn was born in the town of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, into a poor family, on October 24, 1892. His parents were Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn and Miguel Angel Rosa, though he was given only his mother's surname.[2][3] As a child, he learned the craft of cigar making, from which he made a modest living. He also grew to love music and asked his parents to permit him to become a full-time music student. When he was 12 years old, Hern\u00e1ndez studied music in San Juan, under the guidance of music professors Jose Ruellan Lequenica and Jes\u00fas Figueroa. He learned to play many musical instruments, including the clarinet, tuba, violin, piano, and guitar.[4] At 14, he played for the Cocolia Orquestra. Hern\u00e1ndez moved to San Juan where he played for the municipal orchestra under the director Manuel Tizol. In 1913, Hern\u00e1ndez begot his first child, Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez (out of wedlock), to Ana Bone.\n\n### World War I and the Orchestra Europe\n\n[edit]In 1917, Hern\u00e1ndez was working as a musician in North Carolina, when the United States entered World War I. The jazz bandleader, James Reese Europe, recruited brothers Rafael and Jes\u00fas Hern\u00e1ndez, along with 16 more Puerto Ricans, to join the United States Army's Harlem Hell fighters musical band, the Orchestra Europe. He enlisted and was assigned to the U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment (formerly known as the 15th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard, created in New York City June 2, 1913). The regiment, nicknamed \"The Harlem Hell Fighters,\u201d by the Germans, served in France. Hern\u00e1ndez toured Europe with the Orchestra Europe. The 369th was awarded the French Croix de Guerre for battlefield gallantry by the President of France.[5]\n\n### Hernandez and Pedro Flores, Life in Cuba and Mexico\n\n[edit]After World War I ended, he returned to the United States in 1919. Hern\u00e1ndez began a long and intense period of artistic composition and performance. He was part of the Lucky Roberts Band, with which he made his first musical tour of the United States. Later, he moved to Cuba, where he directed the Fausto Theater orchestra in Havana.[6] Later on, Hern\u00e1ndez moved to New York City. In 1925,[6] he started writing songs and organized a trio called \"Trio Borincano.\u201d In 1926, fellow Puerto Rican Pedro Flores, who was a composer, joined the Trio. Even though Hern\u00e1ndez and Flores became and always remained good friends, they soon went their separate ways and artistically competed against each other. After the trio broke up, he formed a quartet called \"Cuarteto Victoria,\" which included singer Myrta Silva, also known as *La Guarachera* and *La Gorda de Oro*. With both groups, Hern\u00e1ndez traveled and played his music all over the United States and Latin America.[7] On September 2, 1927, Hern\u00e1ndez's sister, Victoria, opened Casa Hernandez, a music store which also acted as a booking agency and base of operations for her brother.[5] In 1929, Tr\u00edo Borinquen recorded *Linda Quisqueya* (originally titled *Linda Borinquen*) and that same year, he founded the \"Cuarteto Victoria\" (also known as \"El Cuarteto Rico\") named after his sister.[5]\n\nIn 1932, Hern\u00e1ndez moved to Mexico. There, he directed an orchestra and enrolled in Mexico's National Music Conservatory, to further enrich his musical knowledge. Hern\u00e1ndez also became an actor and organized musical scores in Mexico's \"golden age\" of movies. His wife (and eventual widow) is Mexican.[8]\n\n### \"Lamento borincano\" and \"Preciosa\"\n\n[edit]In 1937, Hern\u00e1ndez wrote \"Lamento Borincano.\u201d That same year, he also wrote \"Preciosa.\u201d In 1947, Hern\u00e1ndez returned to Puerto Rico and became the director of the orchestra at the government-owned WIPR Radio.[7]\n\nHernandez also composed Christmas music, Danzas, Zarzuelas, Guarachas, Lullabies, Boleros, Waltzes, and more.[7]\n\nHern\u00e1ndez's works include \"Ahora seremos felices\" (Now, We Will Be Happy), \"Campanitas de cristal\" (Crystal Bells), \"Capullito de Alhel\u00ed,\u201d \"Culpable\" (Guilty), \"El Cumbanchero\"[9] (also known as *\"Rockfort Rock\"* or *\"Comanchero\" (sic)* to reggae aficionados), \"Ese soy yo\" (That's Me), \"Perfume de Gardenias\" (Gardenia's Perfume), \"Silencio\" (Silence), and \"T\u00fa no comprendes\" (You Don't Understand), among 3,000 others. Many of his compositions were strongly based on Cuban musical idioms, such as the guaracha's \"Cachita\" and \"Buchipluma na' ma,\u201d which were often mistaken as songs by Cuban authors.[10] His music became an important part of Puerto Rican culture.[8]\n\n### Later years and death\n\n[edit]Hern\u00e1ndez was Honorary President of the Authors and Composers Association. He was also the founder of little league baseball in Puerto Rico. President John F. Kennedy christened him \"Mr. Cumbanchero\".[4]\n\nHern\u00e1ndez died in San Juan on December 11, 1965, shortly after Banco Popular de Puerto Rico produced a TV special in his honor in which he addressed the people for the last time. The special was simulcast on all TV and most island radio stations. The TV special was rebroadcast on May 13, 2007. Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez's remains are buried in the Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery of Old San Juan.\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]Puerto Rico has honored his memory by naming public buildings, avenues, and schools after him. The airport in Aguadilla is named Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Airport. There are schools in New York City, Boston, and in Newark, New Jersey named after Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez. Renowned Puerto Rican sculptor Tom\u00e1s Batista created a statue of Hern\u00e1ndez, which is in the municipality of Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico. The Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, the repository of his works, operates a small museum in his honor at its Metropolitan Campus in San Juan, which is directed by his son, Alejandro (Chal\u00ed) Hern\u00e1ndez. The Hernandez Houses housing complex in New York City is named after Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nAt the behest former senator Lucy Arce, the Senate of Puerto Rico, under the first term of Thomas Rivera Schatz built the Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Plaza with a bigger-than-lifesize statue of the composer, and a statue of a Puerto Rican j\u00edbaro riding a horse honoring his **Lamento Borincano**. The park is located at the easternmost tip of San Juan's **Paseo de la Covadonga**.\n\nPuerto Rican singer Marc Anthony recorded Hern\u00e1ndez's \"Preciosa\" and sang the song in a 2005 concert in New York City's Madison Square Garden. According to an article in the *New York Times*:\n\n\"Mr. Anthony did his version of\n\nPreciosa. It may have been the night's most popular love song, precisely because it's not about a woman: it's about a whole island, instead.\"[11]\n\nIn 1969, Puerto Rican actor Orlando Rodriguez played Hernandez in the bio-pic *El Jibarito Rafael*, which was directed by the Mexican actor Juli\u00e1n Soler.[12]\n\nIn 1999, Hern\u00e1ndez was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.[13]\n\nOn March 23, 2001, Casa Hernandez, the music store which served as Hernandez's booking agency and base of operations, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, reference #01000244, as \"Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernandez\".[14]\n\nIn 2014, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez was posthumously inducted to the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame.[15]\n\nIn 2017, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.[16]\n\n### Interpreters\n\n[edit]Notable interpreters include Los Panchos, Marco Antonio Mu\u00f1iz, Xavier Cugat, Perez Prado, Percy Faith an Olga Guillot.\n\n## Military decorations and awards\n\n[edit]Among Hern\u00e1ndez's military decorations are the following:\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- African immigration to Puerto Rico\n- List of Puerto Ricans\n- Puerto Ricans in World War I\n- Puerto Rican songwriters\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Music of Puerto Rico\".

UQP launched the careers of celebrated Australian writers such as David Malouf, Peter Carey, Kate Grenville, Doris Pilkington and Nick Earls.\n\nFirst formed as a traditional university press, UQP branched out into publishing books for general readers in the forms of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, Indigenous writing and children's literature. UQP's 'books and authors have received national and international recognition through literary prizes, rights sales and writers' festivals'. And, from '2010 UQP has released selected out-of-print titles in digital formats, in addition to the digital and print publishing of new books.' (Source: UQP website)\n\nIn 1988, UQP established the annual David Unaipon Award, originally a category of the Queensland Premier's Literary Awards, now the Queensland Literary Awards. The award was awarded for the best writing of the year by an unpublished Indigenous writer. The award was initiated in honour of David Unaipon, one of the earliest published Indigenous writers, in order to support new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander writers to get their books published (Source: ABC website).\n\nUnaipon was born in 1872 at the Point Macleay mission in South Australia. He was a man of many talents as a writer, inventor, musician, and preacher, and from the late 1800s til the mid-1900s was acclaimed as a genius. In 1995, in an acknowledgement of his outstanding talents of writing and inventing, Unaipon's portrait was printed on the Australian $50 dollar note.\n\n-\nThe David Unaipon Award 23 Winners Collection are now part of the UQP eBook Collections.\n\n-\nSee full AustLit entry\nDavid Unaipon was born at the Point McLeay Mission, South Australia, and attended the mission school until 1885 when he left to become a servant. Encouraged by others to pursue his interest in philosophy, science and music, Unaipon read widely and became well-known for his intellectual capacity and inventions. He spoke regularly at schools and learned societies, and often attended government enquiries.\n\nIn the 1920s, he began to study western mythology and began collecting his own people's myths and legends.\n\n-\nSee full AustLit entry\n'From the 2022 David Unaipon winner comes an outstanding and timely collection of speculative fiction imagining futures where Indigenous sovereignty is fully reasserted.\n\n'In this stunningly inventive and thought-provoking collection, Mykaela Saunders poses the question\u2014what might country, community and culture look like in the Tweed if Gooris reasserted their sovereignty?\n\n'Each of the stories in Always Will Be is set in its own future version of the Tweed.

Neglect has traditionally been assessed with paper-and-pencil tasks, which are administered within the reaching space of a person. The purpose of this explorative study is to investigate whether it is possible to assess neglect in the extrapersonal space based on the performance of acute stroke patients, chronic stroke patients and healthy elderly in orientation and exploration tasks when immersed in a three-dimensional (3D)-virtual environment. Six able-bodied healthy elderly and 12 stroke patients (six subacute and six chronic) participated in this explorative cross-sectional study. Neglect was assessed by means of the 3D neglect test. Different parameters were measured at two challenge levels with increasing difficulty. In the easiest level significant differences between the groups were found for total time spent in the test, mean response time left field of vision, and mean response time in the left field of vision of the left virtual reality environment. Differences in search patterns showed that subacute stroke patients had a much more fuzzy search pattern in scanning the environment than healthy elderly and chronic stroke patients. With respect to the more difficult level results showed significant differences between healthy elderly and the total group of stroke patients. The results of this study suggest that a 3D neglect test by means of virtual reality has the potential to detect and measure unilateral neglect.\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Full Text Sources\n\n### Medical\n\n# Content from https:\/\/www.deepdyve.com\/lp\/wiley\/neglect-assessment-as-an-application-of-virtual-reality-BPjPpwAZKr\nError fetching https:\/\/www.deepdyve.com\/lp\/wiley\/neglect-assessment-as-an-application-of-virtual-reality-BPjPpwAZKr: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/www.deepdyve.com\/lp\/wiley\/neglect-assessment-as-an-application-of-virtual-reality-BPjPpwAZKr'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_95bd2107885c4d3e81a6b6a0\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Assessment of visuospatial neglect in stroke patients using virtual reality\\\\\\\" 2007 Scandinavian neurology journal Gothenburg\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] Assessing cognition post-stroke using virtual reality technology\nURL: https:\/\/espace.library.uq.edu.au\/view\/UQ:699216\/s43298019_phd_correctedthesis.pdf\nAssessment of visuospatial neglect in stroke patients using virtual reality: A pilot study.

Neglect has traditionally been assessed with paper-and-pencil tasks, which are administered within the reaching space of a person. The purpose of this explorative study is to investigate whether it is possible to assess neglect in the extrapersonal space based on the performance of acute stroke patients, chronic stroke patients and healthy elderly in orientation and exploration tasks when immersed in a three-dimensional (3D)-virtual environment. Six able-bodied healthy elderly and 12 stroke patients (six subacute and six chronic) participated in this explorative cross-sectional study. Neglect was assessed by means of the 3D neglect test. Different parameters were measured at two challenge levels with increasing difficulty. In the easiest level significant differences between the groups were found for total time spent in the test, mean response time left field of vision, and mean response time in the left field of vision of the left virtual reality environment. Differences in search patterns showed that subacute stroke patients had a much more fuzzy search pattern in scanning the environment than healthy elderly and chronic stroke patients. With respect to the more difficult level results showed significant differences between healthy elderly and the total group of stroke patients. The results of this study suggest that a 3D neglect test by means of virtual reality has the potential to detect and measure unilateral neglect.\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Full Text Sources\n\n### Medical","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"After a systematic search through multiple databases and verification of all details, I have identified the paper you are looking for.

The present work has been developed in the context of the German Medical Informatics Initiative, where 29 university hospitals agreed to the usage of the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for their newly established data integration centers. This standard is optimized to describe and exchange medical data but less suitable for standard statistical analysis which mostly requires tabular data formats.\n\n**Objectives**\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analysis by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should be implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts and offer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n**Methods**\nWe propose the fhircrackr framework, which allows downloading and flattening FHIR resources for data analysis. The framework supports different download and authentication protocols and gives the user full control over the data that is extracted from the FHIR resources and transformed into tables. We implemented it using the programming language R [1] and published it under the GPL-3 open source license.\n\n**Results**\nThe framework was successfully applied to both publicly available test data and real-world data from several ongoing studies. While the processing of larger real-world data sets puts a considerable burden on computation time and memory consumption, those challenges can be attenuated with a number of suitable measures like parallelization and temporary storage mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe fhircrackr R package provides an open source solution within an environment that is familiar to most data scientists and helps overcome the practical challenges that still hamper the usage of EHR data for research.\n\n**Keywords:** Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, electronic health records, health information interoperability, data analysis\n\n## Background and Significance\n\n### Background\n\nThe digitalization of the health sector produces a growing interest in the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for clinical research. With the rise of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the need to share large-scale, near real-time patient data has shifted into focus 1 2 3 and there has been increasing activity in building new infrastructures 4 5 for data integration and data sharing.\n\nIn the context of this growing activity, the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard 6 has developed into one of the most popular interoperability standards worldwide. From the creation of FHIR profiles 7 to the mapping 8 and usage of the FHIR standard for data sharing, data visualization, and data quality assessment, 9 10 11 12 13 a vast number of projects using FHIR continues to grow all over the world.\n\nFollowing this trend, the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) 14 established 29 data integration centers in university hospitals across four consortia to integrate EHR data using FHIR. The FHIR standard focuses on the exchange of health care data and defines around 160 so-called resource types, each of which stands for a distinct entity of information that can be transferred using standard web technologies. 15 While FHIR is well-established as a standard in clinical data exchange, for example, for medical applications, Duda et al 16 have found that it is less commonly used in clinical research. Since FHIR is optimized to describe and transfer medical data of individual patients, it is less tailored to statistical analysis of patient cohorts and other applications requiring tabular data. FHIR resources are represented as interlinked JSON or XML objects instead of the matrix-like structures and cannot be handled by most statistical software. The proposed framework is based on the XML representation of FHIR, which is also used throughout this article.\n\nWe developed a framework for extracting and reshaping data from FHIR resources using the well-established XPath expression language, 17 which allows analysts to create tables from FHIR data that can be processed by any standard statistical or other software that expects tabular data. The framework is implemented in the open-source R package 18 fhircrackr 19 and can be downloaded from the comprehensive R archive network. 20\n\nIn the remainder of this article, we will introduce the basics of the FHIR standard followed by a conceptual description of how the fhircrackr framework builds on this standard. Then, we will illustrate the framework with a reproducible example using open access test data and conclude with a discussion of the framework in light of currently ongoing studies, which use real-world EHR data for statistical analyses in several areas of biomedical research.\n\n### FHIR Basics\n\nThe FHIR standard is used to describe data originating from clinical routine documentation. In this standard, all data elements are represented as so-called FHIR resources. A single FHIR resource holds a specific piece of information like a laboratory measurement, demographic information on a patient, or the description of a medical procedure. A full list of currently defined FHIR resources can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/resourcelist.html*\n. Two simplified examples are shown in\nFig. 1\n, where information on a patient and a measurement of her body temperature are represented in the form of a Patient resource and an Observation resource, respectively.\n\nIdeally, every FHIR resource holds the machine-readable information that is needed to interpret the data including its provenance, the actual data point (e.g., the body temperature measured), the metadata (e.g., the unit and date), and references to other resources the data relates to (e.g., the patient the temperature is taken from). The nested structure of the resource is needed because EHR data, like other kinds of data that is exchanged in discrete units, has an inherently nested structure. In the FHIR R4, the most recent version of the standard, there are around 160 resource types, each of them devoted to a specific kind of medical information. In theory, each FHIR resource is individually retrievable from the server, but for statistical analysis, they are mostly downloaded in bundles. A FHIR bundle is a collection of multiple resources that can be exchanged and processed as a single entity. The FHIR standard is a RESTful specification, which uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication. To download data from the server, the standard describes the so-called FHIR Search paradigm, in which the user specifies the scope of the downloaded data with suitable search parameters and downloads the respective resources using HTTP GET or POST. The details of this paradigm are beyond the scope of this article, however, extensive documentation can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/search.html*\n.\n\nThe structure of the FHIR standard stands in contrast to data formats that are usually employed in data analysis. Most statistical software expects a matrix-like structure, where columns represent features and rows represent observations on the set of features formed by those columns. A single body temperature measurement, for example, could be one cell in a matrix that has patients in rows and measurements of vital signs in columns. In contrast, the FHIR representation of this single cell would be an entire json\/xml object that contains not only the measured temperature value but also references to the patient it is taken from and other metadata. Information that is contained in a single table in a classical data analysis setting is expressed in a large number of interlinked resources when the data is represented in FHIR. Developing a framework bridging the gap between those two representations is the primary goal of this work.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analyses by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should have the following characteristics:\n\nBuild on the communication interface defined by HL7 FHIR.\n\nSupport common authentication protocols used for sensitive data.\n\nBe implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts.\n\nOffer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n\n## Methods\n\nTwo steps are necessary to make FHIR data available for analysis: (1) download the data from the server and (2) transform the data into a table format. To perform those tasks, the fhircrackr framework defines a set of classes and related functions, an overview over which can be found in Fig. 2 . Below, we will describe the necessary steps sequentially.\n\n### Downloading FHIR Data\n\nTo access FHIR data, the fhircrackr framework builds on the FHIR Search paradigm defined by HL7. The framework provides functionalities for the construction of FHIR search expressions via the function\n*fhir_url()*\nand uses the function\n*fhir_search()*\nto download the bundles.\n*fhir_search()*\nallows for basic authentication and Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0\n21\n) as well as automatic paging (sequential download of search result bundles) when the result is distributed over several bundles. Downloads can be done via GET or POST, depending on the use case, and can easily be parallelized when necessary. See\nFig. 3\nfor a representation of the downloading workflow. The downloading functions build on well-established functions from the httr-Package,\n22\nbut extend them by providing mechanisms for automatic paging as well as helper functions for building valid FHIR search requests and handling of common errors. The result of the downloading process is a list of FHIR bundles, which is represented as an S4 class\n23\ncalled\n*fhir_bundle_list*\n. Within this list, a single bundle is an object of class\n*fhir_bundle_xml*\n, an S4 class extending\n*xml_document*\nfrom the xml2 R package.\n24\nThe FHIR bundles can be transformed into tables (referred to as \u201cflattening\u201d) as described in the next section.\n\n### Flattening FHIR Data\n\n#### Resource Types\n\nDepending on the type of search request, a FHIR bundle can contain more than one resource type. When the resources are flattened, the fhircrackr framework constructs one table for each resource type, as shown in Fig. 4 . This is necessary because the variability between resources of different types is larger than the variability between resources of the same type. Putting the data of all resource types in a single table would thus create unreasonably large and sparsely populated tables.\n\n#### Elements to Extract\n\nThere are two modes of flattening the resources, depicted in\nFig. 5\n. Either (1) the entire structure is flattened, that is, every element that occurs in at least one of the resources will be turned into a column of the resulting table, or (2) a predefined subset of the elements is extracted from the resources. The former approach requires little knowledge about the individual structure of the resources but can result in very wide and sparse tables. The latter approach, in contrast, requires some knowledge about the structure of the resources, but will result in more concise and densely populated tables.\nFig. 6\nprovides an overview over the workflow of the flattening process: All information needed to flatten the resources is represented in the class\n*fhir_table_description*\n, which contains the type of resource to target (an object of class\n*fhir_resource_type*\n) and a list of XPath 1.0\n17\nexpressions (an object of class\n*fhir_columns*\n) specifying which elements of the resource to extract into the columns of the resulting table. The function\n*fhir_crack()*\nruns the extraction on all resources in the bundles, with one row being created per resource. If a specified element is not present in one of the resources, the corresponding cell in the resulting table is left empty.\n\nThe generic extraction process based on a user-specified XPath scheme ensures that the framework does not depend on any predefined resource structure, apart from it being valid xml. This has the advantage of making the tool compatible with both standard FHIR resources as well as arbitrary extensions to those resources and makes sure that the tool works on all versions of the FHIR standard, like the past STU3, current R4, and future R5 version.\n\n#### Repeating Elements\n\nTo represent complex EHR data adequately, FHIR resources can contain repeating elements, that is, elements with a cardinality greater than one. The FHIR core specification of the Patient resource, 25 for example, defines a 0* cardinality for the element \u201cPatient.address,\u201d meaning that a single Patient resource can contain zero, one, or multiple address elements. Creating a new column for each instance of the element would greatly inflate the resulting table, as a single resource with 10 address elements would result in 10 address columns. This effect worsens as the number of elements with multiple instances increases. To counteract this issue, the fhircrackr default puts values of repeating elements in the same column, separated by a string that can be defined in the table description, as depicted in Fig. 7 . To be able to tell apart which value belongs to which parent element, the fhircrackr can assign an index to each entry, which is surrounded by prespecified brackets. Together with the XPath or header of the column, the indices allow a reconstruction of the original FHIR structure, including the precise position of every element. We are aware that this default behavior violates the first normal form of database normalization, 26 which states that there should be no columns with sets of values. In consultation with various statisticians, we have however adopted the presented solution, since searching such complex fields in the cases considered here is easier to handle in common statistical packages than distributing the values over several columns or tables.\n\nTo resolve columns with sets of values, the fhircrackr framework provides functionalities to automatically split those values, either into a wide format with multiple columns (called casting), or into a long format with multiple rows (called melting). Fig. 8 illustrates the two approaches: In a cast table, the names of each column reflect the original position of the element and each row represents one resource. In a molten table, the number of columns stays the same and multiple entries are spread over several rows. As opposed to casting, melting is done with respect to a specific element (the address element in this example) and values from all other elements (e.g., the id element) are copied into the newly created rows. Fig. 9 represents the workflow of casting or melting a table with multiple entries.\n\nThe steps described so far only aim at making the data available in tabular form. In addition, common techniques of data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization should precede any statistical analysis, which however is beyond the scope of this article. A good summary of those methods specifically for EHR data is given by Yu et al. 27\n\n#### Recreating Resources\n\nApart from turning FHIR resources into flat tables, the fhircrackr framework also allows data to flow in the opposite direction, creating FHIR resources from flat tables. Because the framework is able to remember the original structure of the resources through column headers and indexing of entries, it is possible to recreate the original resources from the flattened tables. This allows the user to selectively remove or add single elements as well as running more complex computations to augment the original FHIR resources before sending them back to a server.\n\n### R Package fhircrackr\n\nWe implemented the above functionalities in a package called fhircrackr using the programming language R\n1\nand published it under the GPL-3 open source license on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (see \u201cSoftware Availability\u201d below). The package requires R Version 4.1.0 or higher and can be run on any operating system that can run R. While the package does not have specific hardware requirements and can be operated on a standard office notebook, the actual requirements regarding RAM and CPU strongly depend on the use case and the scope of the data being processed.\n\n## Results\n\n### Application to Test Data\n\nTo illustrate the basic functionalities of the package, we have set up a simple project on publicly available test data\n28\nat\n*https:\/\/github.com\/POLAR-fhiR\/fhircrackr_examples*\n. In this project, we investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and hypertensive disease (ICD-10 Code I10 - I15) diagnosed as a comorbidity in a small patient cohort. To achieve this, we need to (1) compute the BMI for each patient from downloaded Observation resources containing body weight and body height measurements and (2) relate it to the diagnosis information given in the Encounter and Condition resources of those patients. First, the code example shows how the function\n*fhir_url()*\nis used to build the appropriate FHIR search request which is then sent to the server using\n*fhir_search()*\n. The resulting list of FHIR bundles contains Patient and Observation resources. To flatten those resources into tables, two table descriptions are defined as shown in\nFig. 10\n.\n\nThe function\n*fhir_crack()*\nis then used to create the two tables and after some data preprocessing, the BMI is computed and a list of patient IDs is used to download the associated Encounter and Condition resources. According to the MII implementation guide,\n29\nwhich profiles an Encounter in the German health care system that is used in the test data, the diagnoses of a Patient are referenced in the Encounter resource and there can be multiple diagnoses listed in one encounter, as shown in\nFig. 11\n. The table created from those Encounters will therefore contain multiple entries in the diagnosis columns, as shown in the top row of\nFig. 12\n. Those multiple diagnoses have to be spread over multiple rows using\n*fhir_melt()*\n, as shown in the middle row of\nFig. 12\nand subsequently be freed from indices with\n*fhir_rm_indices()*\nas shown in the bottom row of the figure. Then, they can be filtered for comorbidity diagnoses. Finally, the patients with a hypertension comorbidity diagnosis can be identified and the relationship between hypertension and BMI can be examined with suitable statistical routines.\n\n### Application to Real-World Data\n\nTo date, fhircrackr is used in a number of ongoing studies within the German MII. In the use case POLAR 30 it is used for a distributed analysis in 13 university hospitals to detect health risks in patients with polypharmacy. The clinical trial HELP 31 uses the package to evaluate a decision support system for bloodstream infections in five university hospitals. Several smaller studies (e.g., refs. 32 and 33) showcase the usage of the fhircrackr in publicly available GitHub repositories. 34 35\n\nIn all these applications, the analysis is distributed in the form of plain or dockered R scripts via version control platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or DockerHub. The scripts generate tabular data on different levels of abstraction from simple feature extraction to more complex local aggregation for distributed learning approaches. All these approaches are easy to implement once the FHIR data has been made available as tables in R.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Usage of Real-World Data\n\nThe use of nested information from real-world EHR data in data science applications has demonstrated difficulties, and som\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_7d353d3c10944ae4b829f13e\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Julia Palm\\\\\\\" physician attitudes AI German university hospital ARDS bacteremia Leipzig\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Publications - The Health Atlas\nURL: https:\/\/www.health-atlas.de\/publications\/export\nKruse, Alexander Helhorn, Lo An Phan-Vogtmann, Julia Palm, Eric Thomas, Andreas Iffland, Andrew Heidel, Susanne M\u00fcller, Kutaiba Saleh, Karsten Krohn, Martin ...Read more","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_949ea09cab09424594e1d9bd\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Julia Palm\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"physician attitudes\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"artificial intelligence\\\\\\\" Germany hospital\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Future Medical Artificial Intelligence Application ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2021\/3\/e26646\/citations\nFuture Medical Artificial Intelligence Application Requirements and Expectations of Physicians in German University Hospitals: Web-Based Survey.Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Knowledge, attitude, and practice of primary care ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/391004989_Knowledge_attitude_and_practice_of_primary_care_physicians_toward_clinical_AI-assisted_digital_health_technologies_Systematic_review_and_meta-analysis\n... physician attitudes toward artificial intelligence in primary care ...

From May 2011 to August 2012, 77 patients underwent primary SIL surgery for colon cancer by one colorectal surgeon. Among them, 61 patients were one-to-one-matched to control patients who had undergone conventional laparoscopic (CL) surgery with a propensity-matched score, and the outcomes were compared. Two hundred forty-seven patients with colon cancer underwent radical colectomy. Of these, 77 patients underwent SIL colectomy. After matching, there were no significant differences in the general characteristics between the patients undergoing the two types of surgery. Operation time was significantly longer in SIL surgery (139 vs 121 minutes, P = 0.001), but procedure time (107 vs 99 minutes, P = 0.069) was not significantly longer than CL surgery after eliminating closure time (31 vs 22 minutes, P < 0.001) from the operation time. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the two groups (3.3 vs 1.6%, P = 1.000). The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 23 and 22 for SIL and CL surgery, respectively (P = 0.332). The mean follow-up period was 15.7 for the SIL group and 21.4 months for the CL group (P < 0.001) with two recurrences in the SIL group (3.3%) and three recurrences in the CL group (4.9%, P = 1.000). Disease-free survival at 20 months did not differ significantly between the two groups (93.3 vs 94.7%, P = 0.939). SIL for colonic malignancy can be safely applied for various types of operations and can provide equivalent oncologic resection and perioperative outcomes compared with CL surgery.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_a60864fc17b6408ab2353a38\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Jung-A Yun\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"zebrafish\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"pigmentation\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"ciliogenesis\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"centriole\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"Kallmann syndrome\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"ciliary\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: The role of cilia during organogenesis in zebrafish\nURL: https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/38086423\/\nby J Liu \u00b7 2023 \u00b7 Cited by 10 \u2014 Cilia are hair-like organelles that protrude from the surface of eukaryotic cells and are present on the surface of nearly all human cells.\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Zebrafish in dermatology: a comprehensive review of their ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/journals\/physiology\/articles\/10.3389\/fphys.2023.1296046\/full\nby J Qu \u00b7 2023 \u00b7 Cited by 29 \u2014 This review offers a concise overview of zebrafish skin attributes, highlighting the shared melanin production pathways with humans.Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Small molecule screening in zebrafish: an in vivo approach to ...\nURL: https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC2912314\/\nby KL Taylor \u00b7 2010 \u00b7 Cited by 114 \u2014 MoTP can specifically kill differentiated melanocytes, and has become a valuable chemical tool to explore melanocyte stem cell biology [42-44].Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 3: CPT1B\u2010Mediated Fatty Acid Oxidation Induces ...\nURL: https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pcmr.70063?af=R\nUsing a zebrafish model, CPT1B was implicated in melanogenesis.

In 1687, Newton presented the law of gravitation, which includes the inverse square law. But the parameters of the elliptical orbit were not included in Newton's law.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_9e18a764cfba417f8d228f77\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"inverse problem\\\\\\\" geophysics 1980s \\\\\\\"three authors\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Moscow\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"Russia\\\\\\\" OR \\\\\\\"Soviet\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Inverse Scattering of Acoustic and Electromagnetic Waves ...\nURL: https:\/\/digikogu.taltech.ee\/et\/Download\/3bbe1064-ce1f-420c-9046-3228aafba915\/InverseScatteringofAcousticandElectromagnetic.pdf\nThe inverse problem begins with the query of the direct problem.

This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's. Within this nation's air arm, a specific numerically designated squadron, which had earlier flown other aircraft types against targets such as projectile launch sites, was eventually equipped with this effective fighter.

The balloons were launched mainly from land; however, some were also launched from *Vulcano*. The Austrians used smaller pilot balloons to determine the correct fuse settings. At least one bomb fell in the city; however, due to the wind changing after launch, most of the balloons missed their target, and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship *Vulcano*.[14][15][16] On 4 July, she had run aground at Malamocco and come under fire from Manfrin Fort. A crew member was killed. She was damaged at her paddlebox. *Vulcan* was refloated the next day with assistance from SMS *Custoza* (1848) and the Austrian steamships *Curtatone* and *Dorotea*.[17]\n\n## Subsequent Service\n\n[edit]In September 1869, a boiler explosion killed eleven of her crew and severely injured many more.[18] On 17 November 1869, she was one of seventy ships, all of which drew less than 13 feet of water, that sailed through the Suez Canal in a procession marking the opening of the canal.[19]\n\nShe remained in service until 1872, and finally struck in 1884 to become a coal hulk.[1]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b****c****d****e**The Influence of Air Power Upon History, Walter J.

It made use of cheap, simple balloons filled with hydrogen and carrying either a trailing steel wire to damage high voltage power lines by producing a short circuit, or incendiary devices to start fires in fields, forests and heathland. A total of 99,142 Outward balloons were launched; about half carried incendiaries and half carried trailing wires.[a]\n\nCompared to Japan's better-known fire balloons, Outward balloons were crude. They had to travel a much shorter distance so they flew at a lower altitude \u2013 16,000 ft (4,900 m), compared with 38,000 ft (12,000 m) \u2013 and had only a simple mechanism to regulate altitude by means of dropping ballast or venting lifting gas. This meant the balloons were simple to mass-produce and only cost 35 shillings each (approximately equivalent to \u00a3121 in 2023[3]). The free flying balloon attacks were highly successful. Although difficult to assess exactly, their economic impact on Germany was far in excess of the cost to the British government.[2][4][5]\n\n## History and development\n\n[edit]Because there was concern over what could happen if a barrage balloon accidentally got loose, in 1937 the British carried out a study on the damage that may be caused by a balloon-carried wire hitting power lines.[2] These concerns were evidently borne out when early in 1940, the Air Vice Marshal Balloon Command, the organisation responsible for the barrage balloons, wrote that \"Since the outbreak of the war, I have had constant complaints from the electricity distributors regarding the damage done in this country by [barrage] balloons that have broken away from their moorings\". to which he added \"...advantage might be taken of this to impede and inconvenience the enemy\".[6]\n\nIt was proposed that bomb-laden balloons could be launched from France. Their position would be tracked by radio triangulation and the bombs would be released by radio control when the balloon drifted over a worthwhile target.[7] This plan was never put into action; objections included that \"attacks of this nature should not be originated from a cricketing country\" and a concern that the enemy might retaliate with similar weapons.[2] The idea became redundant when defeat in the Battle of France put possible launch sites out of British control.\n\nWe may make a virtue of our misfortune.\n\n\n[2]\n\nOn the night of 17\/18 September 1940, a gale broke loose a number of British barrage balloons and carried them across the North Sea. In Sweden and Denmark, they damaged power lines, disrupted railways and knocked down the antenna for the Swedish International radio station.[8][2] Five balloons were reported to have reached Finland.[9] A report on the damage and confusion reached the British War Cabinet on 23 September 1940. Winston Churchill then directed that the use of free-flying balloons as weapons against Germany should be investigated.[9][6] The Air Ministry initially produced a negative report, possibly because the Ministry of Aircraft Production felt balloons would be ineffective weapons and would consume too many resources.[2]\n\nTO SUM UP - If D.B.D. [Director of Boom Defences] is given a free hand, he is prepared to guarantee that he could produce an incendiary balloon attack organisation for operating from an East Coast area (say Harwich) which could be built up using women operatives, coal gas \/and\/or hydrogen and to produce the incendiaries, balloons and equipment etc. without recognisable interference to any other service activity, but from the experience obtained in attempting to operate F.B.B. in collaboration with the Air Ministry, it is clear that it should be a Naval and not a combined Naval and Air-Force undertaking.\n\n\n[2]\n\nThe Admiralty took up the idea with more enthusiasm. In particular, Captain Gerald Banister, Director of Boom Defence and a proponent of using balloons as a weapon of offence, pressed the point. The meteorological considerations \u2013 including the possibility that the weather might favour the enemy retaliating in kind \u2013 were carefully investigated and found to be highly favourable; winds above 16,000 feet (4,900 m) tend to blow from west to east, making it difficult for the Germans to retaliate with similar balloons.[10]\n\nOf particular interest was the possibility of damaging Germany's electricity distribution network by shorting high-voltage overhead power lines with thin wires dragged by balloons. The results of investigations were favourable: trials showed that even a thin steel wire, much thinner than that used to tether the static barrage balloons, when drawn in sliding contact across two or more phases, could cause an arc as long as 15 ft (4.6 m) and that arc would be maintained until the circuit breaker opened. In some cases, the arc's heat could melt the aluminium outer layers and then the reinforcing steel centre strands of the conductors. Even if the cable was not severed, the conductors would be weakened so that they would be susceptible to breaking due to increased electrical demand or normal weather events such as wind, snow and ice.[6]\n\nInvestigations revealed that it was common in pre-war Germany to use a Petersen coil as protection against earthing; this design was effective against a short between a high voltage cable and earth but relatively vulnerable to a short between different phases. A short between phases could result in damage, not just to a cable but to transformers and the circuit breakers.[11][6] The Admiralty ran trials using surplus spherical latex meteorological balloons about 8 ft (2.4 m) in diameter when inflated. Calculations based on the trials predicted that there would be between a 10% to 75% chance of a balloon's wire coming into contact with a high-voltage overhead line during a 30 mi (48 km) flight along the ground.\n\nBalloons could also carry incendiaries. Large areas of pine forest and heathland in Germany made the countryside vulnerable to random incendiary attack and it was hoped that the Germans would be forced to assign large numbers of people to the task of fire watching, possibly diverting them from more productive war-work. The Admiralty concluded that the balloons could be produced at very little cost; many of the important parts already existed as surplus materials and despite the needs of conventional barrage balloons, there was plenty of hydrogen gas with which to fill the balloons.[2] The balloons could be used with a small number of British personnel who would face minimal risks.\n\n## Design\n\n[edit]The balloons used were surplus weather balloons of which the Navy had a stock of 100,000 all carefully stored in French chalk.[11] Using this surplus was important to the practicality of Operation Outward because white latex rubber from which they were made was an important war material that was in short supply.[12] The balloons were about 8 ft (2.4 m) in diameter when inflated.[b] They carried a simple timing and regulating mechanism that was based upon a design developed for Operation Albino \u2013 a plan to use somewhat larger latex balloons as anti-aircraft weapons.[c]\n\nAt launch, a slow-burning fuse was lit; its length was calibrated to the estimated time to arrive over German-controlled territory. At first, the balloon rose rapidly and expanded in size until an internal cord tightened, preventing further increase in altitude beyond 25,000 ft (7,600 m) by releasing some gas; the balloon would then begin a slow descent due to the hydrogen gradually leaking away.[6] After a while, the slow burning fuse would release a bung in a can of mineral oil; as the oil slowly dripped out, the balloon's payload would lighten, arresting its descent. The same slow-burning fuse was also used to release the balloon's weapon. There were a number of payload designs designated: *wire*, *beer*, *jelly*, *socks*, *lemon*, and *jam*.\n\n*Wire*\n\n[edit]About half of the Outward balloons carried the *wire* payload. In the case of the *wire*, the slow burning fuse would burn through the cord that held the trailing wire. The trailing wire consisted of about 700 ft (210 m) of 1\u204416 in (1.6 mm) diameter hemp cord with a breaking strength of 40 lb (18 kg). The hemp cord was attached to 300 ft (91 m) of 0.072 in (1.8 mm) diameter (15 gauge) steel wire.[6] Tests had revealed that the main reason for the trailing wire getting caught up in ground obstacles was \"springiness\" at the end of the wires; this was addressed by obtaining special straightened wire.[11]\n\nAt the same time as the trailing wire was deployed, a stopper on the canister of mineral oil was released so that it would assist in maintaining altitude by slowly dripping out and lightening the load on the balloon.[6] It was calculated that the balloon should have a slightly negative lift of about 1 lb (0.45 kg) so that the balloon would descend until a short length of the wire had its weight taken by the ground. The long length of hemp cord allowed the balloon to maintain an altitude of about 1,000 ft (300 m) which would reduce the chance of the balloon being becalmed in still air.\n\nThe plan was that the wire tail would be dragged for about 30 mi (48 km) across the land and eventually encounter a high-voltage transmission line.[6] A phase-to-phase short circuit would be initiated; during trials, arcs 15 ft (4.6 m) long were initiated by the wire.[6] The arc would burn for some time before the transmission line protection operated; there was a good chance the circuit breaker would be damaged and the conductors might burn through due to arcing. This could cause a line to collapse and require repairs. German efforts to protect transmission lines from attack were unsuccessful: neither a new type of line conductor clamp nor different over-current protection settings had any useful effect.[6]\n\n*Beer*, *jelly* and *socks*\n\n[edit]*Beer*, *jelly* and *socks* were incendiary devices.\n\n*Beer* consisted of a cylindrical metal container 8+1\u20442 in (22 cm) in diameter and 9 in (23 cm) long containing seven or eight half-pint bottles.[16] Each bottle was a Self-igniting phosphorus (SIP) grenade[15] \u2013 it contained white phosphorus, benzene, water and a strip of raw rubber, two in (5.1 cm) long, which dissolved and formed a layer. After a delay caused by a slow burning fuse, the metal container was tipped open and its contents allowed to fall out. Around the neck of each bottle was a small metal sleeve that held a heavy ball about one in (25 mm) in diameter.[16] The ball was attached to a strip of canvas; this ensured that when the bottles dropped they fell the right way round.[16][17] The SIP grenades would spontaneously ignite on shattering.\n\n*Jelly* were cans of incendiary jelly.[18] Each cuboid can measured about 11+1\u20442 in \u00d7 6+1\u20442 in \u00d7 4 in (29 cm \u00d7 17 cm \u00d7 10 cm) and contained one imp gal (4.5 L) of jelly.[19] A release mechanism and a fuse were provided; on ignition a fireball erupted with a radius of about 20 ft (6.1 m).[19]\n\n*Socks* were long thin canvas bags of incendiary material each weighing about 6 lb (2.7 kg). Socks were packed with wood wool, bound with wire and soaked in boiling paraffin wax.[2][17] Each Outward balloon could carry three socks. The bundle measured about 27 in \u00d7 10 in \u00d7 10 in (690 mm \u00d7 250 mm \u00d7 250 mm).[19] When dropped, socks formed a V\u2011shaped sausage designed to catch in the crown of a tree.[2] Fuses were inserted in each end of the device and it would burn from each end for 15 minutes.[2] In 1941 the Royal Navy had a stock of 10,000 such socks already fused and ready to be used and another 20,000 bodies that could be brought forward as required.[2][d]\n\n*Lemon* and *jam*\n\n[edit]All the payloads that are clearly code named and described are either a trailing wire or an incendiary. *Small yellow bombs* left over from Operation Albino were also used and it seems likely that these are identified by one of these code words.[20][21] It is possible that the other was used to drop leaflets \u2013 there are occasional, vague mentions of leaflet drops in the records.[2]\n\n## Deployment\n\n[edit]After a lengthy bureaucratic struggle between the opponents in the Air Ministry and proponents in the Admiralty, the British Chiefs of Staff gave the go\u2011ahead in September 1941 and a launch site was set up, based at HMS *Beehive*, a Royal Navy shore establishment near Felixstowe in Suffolk. The actual balloon releases took place at the Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club.[22] The first launches took place on 20 March 1942. Within days, the British were receiving reports of forest fires near Berlin and Tilsit in East Prussia.[23]\n\nThe personnel that launched the balloons were six Royal Navy and Royal Marine officers, 80 Royal Marines, 7 Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) officers and 140 non-commissioned WRNS.[2] The operation also required the assistance of the RAF Balloon Command (that supplied and delivered the hydrogen) and the Naval Meteorological Services.[2] The balloons were inflated using hydrogen from pressure cylinders that were brought to the launch site by truck. They were inflated inside three-sided tents or windbreaks. During inflation, it was necessary to keep the latex wet with a water spray \u2013 otherwise, friction between the balloon and the tent canvas might have caused the hydrogen to ignite. The inflated balloons were conveyed by hand to a dispersal point, where their payload was attached.\n\nBalloon operations could be hazardous, and there were many instances of launch crew requiring hospital treatment for burns caused by exploding balloons or by mishandling incendiary payloads.[24] The WRNS were equipped with \"flash-proof jacket & hood (\u00bd mica & \u00bd fine copper gauze over the face) + protective cream on hands and fire-proof black gloves\".[e]\n\nFor security reasons, the Felixstowe launch crews were referred to as a \"Boom-defence\" unit, a cover story that was partly true as they were put to work maintaining anti-submarine nets when weather conditions were not right for balloon launches. The Felixstowe golf club site had a number of Lewis Guns for anti-aircraft defence, which the WRNS women were trained to operate, occasionally releasing balloons for the purpose of target practice.[26]\n\n| Period | Wire | Beer | Jelly | Socks | Lemon | Jam | Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| \"ordinary\" (20 March 1942 to 7 February 1944) | 54,369\n|\n24,075\n|\n5,900\n|\n9,291\n|\n-\n|\n-\n|\n96,625\n|\n| \"trickle\" (29 April 1944 to 4 September 1944) | 230\n|\n2,808\n|\n1,596\n|\n253\n|\n899\n|\n739\n|\n6,517\n|\n| Total | 54,599\n|\n26,883\n|\n7,496\n|\n9,644\n|\n899\n|\n739\n|\n99,142 |\n\n## Effects\n\n[edit]The British were keen to assess the effectiveness of Operation Outward. Intercepts of Luftwaffe communications soon showed German fighters were trying to shoot down balloons. This encouraged the British as it was felt that the harassment value on German air defences alone justified Operation Outward \u2013 it cost the Germans more, in fuel and wear and tear on aircraft, to destroy each balloon than it cost the British to make them. Later, reports were received revealing damage to electricity supplies and fires in forests and on farms.[27] Most of these reports were gleaned from newspaper reports in Denmark, France and other occupied countries where the German authorities tried to paint the British attacks in an unfavourable light.[27]\n\nAfter the war, German records revealed that the trailing wire attacks had caused the Germans considerable inconvenience with electricity supplies frequently being interrupted and significant damage to the electrical distribution network.[2] A 1946 report concluded that, based on available records, \u00a31,500,000 of damage was done (approximately equivalent to \u00a369 million in 2023[3]).[4] The report also stated that the actual amount of damage must have been far higher because the records were incomplete with no available records for the Russian zone and all records becoming less reliable after 1943.[4] The Germans had attempted to record interrupts to the lower voltage lines but the incidents were so frequent that the recording was abandoned.[2] In addition to sending up fighters, the Germans used anti-aircraft fire against the balloons, sometimes shut down electric cables when an attack was anticipated, and modified the circuit breakers on high voltage networks.[2]\n\nIn July 1942, a second launch site was set up at Oldstairs Bay near Dover.[23] On 12 July 1942, a wire-carrying balloon struck a 110 kV power line near Leipzig. A failure in the circuit breaker at the B\u00f6hlen power station caused a fire that destroyed the station;[1] this was Outward's greatest success.[6]\n\nThe effects of the incendiary attacks were very difficult to assess \u2013 it could be difficult to tell whether any particular fire was caused by *Outward* or by an accident, sabotage, or aircraft-dropped incendiary. Intelligence sources, including reports from newspapers printed in occupied Europe, indicated that some fires had definitely been caused by Outward.[27] Outward caused damage in neutral countries \u2013 on the night of 19\/20 January 1944, two trains collided at Laholm in Sweden after an Outward balloon knocked out electrical lighting on the railway.[1] Changing winds could also blow balloons back to the United Kingdom. On one occasion, a balloon knocked out the electricity supply to the town of Ipswich.[28]In addition, failures in the altitude adjustment mechanism caused such balloons to fall in Belgium in an area ranging from Tournai to Andenne.[29]\n\n## End of the operation\n\n[edit]In August 1942, launches reached 1,000 per day and later increased to attacks involving up to 1,800 balloons all launched over a period of three to four hours.[27] Balloon launches continued, though they were frequently suspended when there were large air raids on Germany as it was feared the balloons might damage Allied bombers.[27] From May 1944 it was decided to change tactics because of increased Allied aircraft activity. The mass balloon launches were stopped and replaced with a \"trickle\" of balloons launched from three sites at ten-minute intervals throughout daylight hours.[27]\n\nOnly 2% of the balloons were to be of the trailing wire type.[27] The \"trickle system\" was not thought to be a significant threat to Allied aircraft so it could go on uninterrupted.[27] The trickle system simplified the hydrogen supply requirements of the launch sites and released transport vehicles and compressed gas cylinders needed for operations against German V-1 flying bombs and for the Normandy landings.[27] The last balloons were launched on 4 September 1944.[1]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- Footnotes\n\n**^**Sources agree on the total number but vary as to the exact proportions of wire and incendiary payloads, Peebles gives a little more than half to incendiaries,[1]National Archive records vary slightly but give a little more than half to trailing wires.[2]**^**An eight foot diameter hydrogen filled balloon might be expected to lift 18.66 lb (8.46 kg).[13]**^**Operation Albino was a plan to use many free balloons to form an aerial minefield.

If an aircraft caught the wire, the drag of the parachute would cause the bomb to be drawn down onto the aircraft where it would explode on contact. Albino was tried but was not particularly successful.[14][15]**^**If one Outward balloon carried three socks then the 9,644*sock*payloads mentioned in the records would have almost exactly used this supply.**^**WRNS Cecilia Banister quoted by Finley.[25]**^**The figures in the table come directly from a document in the National Archive.

(March 2010) |\n\n**Operation Diver** was the British code name for the V-1 flying bomb campaign launched by the German *Luftwaffe* in 1944 against London and other parts of Britain. Diver was the code name for the V-1, against which the defence consisted of anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons and fighter aircraft.\n\nThe British Double-Cross System used double agents to plant false information about the accuracy of the V-1 bombardment. Anti-aircraft guns proved the most effective form of defence in the later stages of the campaign, with the aid of radar-based technology and the proximity fuse. The V-1 campaign from ground launch sites ended by the middle of 1944 with the Allied occupation of the launch sites.\n\n## Diver Plan\n\n[edit]The Diver Plan was prepared in early 1944 following the first reports of the weapon in April 1943 and the discovery of its intended launch sites in late 1943. The plan had to be flexible enough to cover the anticipated assault on Britain and the needs of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Europe. The V-1 offensive began on the sixth day after the D-Day landings, when the first sighting of an incoming V-1 approaching the English coast was reported by the Royal Observer Corps with the message \"Diver, Diver, Diver\". Defences that had been guarding the embarkation ports for the invasion were redeployed against the V-1.\n\n## Defences\n\n[edit]### Anti-aircraft guns\n\n[edit]Anti-aircraft guns were redeployed in several moves: first in mid-June 1944 from positions on the North Downs to the south coast of England; then a cordon closing the Thames Estuary to attacks from the east. In September 1944 a new linear defence line was formed on the coast of East Anglia, and finally in December there was a further layout along the Lincolnshire\u2013Yorkshire coast. The deployments were prompted by the ever-changing approach tracks of the missiles which were determined by the Allied advance through Western Europe.\n\nAnti-aircraft gunners found that such small, fast-moving targets were difficult to hit. At first, it took an average of 2,500 shells to bring down a V-1. The average altitude of the V-1, between 2,000\u20133,000 ft (610\u2013910 m) was in a narrow band above the optimum engagement height range for light 40 mm Bofors guns. The rate of traverse of the standard British QF 3.7 inch mobile gun was too slow for the heights at which V-1s flew and static gun installations with faster traverses had to be built at great cost. The development of centimetric (roughly 30 GHz frequency) gun laying radars based on the cavity magnetron and the development of the proximity fuze helped to neutralise the advantages of speed and size which the V-1 possessed. In 1944 Bell Labs started delivery of an anti-aircraft predictor fire-control system based around an analogue computer, which supplanted the previous electro-mechanical Kerrison Predictor) just in time for use in the campaign.\n\n#### Technological advances\n\n[edit]By mid-August 1944, the threat was all but overcome by the expedited arrival of two enormously effective electronic aids for anti-aircraft guns, the first developed by the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT Rad Lab) radar-based automatic gun-laying (using, among others, the SCR-584 radar) and the proximity fuze. Both of these had been requested by Anti-Aircraft Command and arrived in numbers, starting in June 1944, just as the guns reached their free-firing positions on the coast. Seventeen percent of all flying bombs entering the coastal gun belt were destroyed by guns in the first week on the coast. This rose to 60 per cent by 23 August and 74 per cent in the last week of the month, when on one day 82 per cent were shot down. The rate increased from one V-1 for every 2,500 shells fired to one for every hundred.\n\n### Barrage balloons\n\n[edit]Barrage balloons were also deployed against the missiles but the leading edges of the V-1's wings were equipped with balloon cable cutters and fewer than 300 V-1s are known to have been destroyed by hitting cables.\n\n### Aircraft\n\n[edit]Parts of the south of England, over which the V-1s were expected to fly, were allocated specifically for fighter operations. Most fighter aircraft were too slow to catch a V-1 except in a dive and even when intercepted, the V-1 was difficult to bring down. Machine-gun bullets had little effect on the sheet steel structure and 20 mm cannon shells were explosive projectiles; detonating the warhead could destroy the fighter as well. The V-1 was nearly immune to conventional air-combat techniques because of its design, which dispensed with a pilot and piston engine with a cooling system. One hit on the pilot or oxygen system can damage or shoot down a conventional aeroplane but there is no pilot in a cruise missile. The Argus pulse jet of the V-1 could be shot full of holes and still provide sufficient thrust for flight. The only vulnerable point of the engine was the valve array at the front. The only other vulnerable points on the V-1 were the bomb detonators and the line from the fuel tank; three very small targets inside the fuselage. An explosive shell from a fighter's cannon or anti-aircraft gun hitting the warhead was most effective.\n\nWhen the attacks began in mid-June 1944 there were fewer than 30 Hawker Tempests in No. 150 Wing RAF to defend against them. Few other aircraft had the low-altitude speed to be effective. Early attempts to intercept V-1s often failed but techniques were rapidly developed. These included using the airflow over an interceptor's wing to raise one wing of the V-1, by sliding the wing tip under the bomb's wing and bringing it to within 6 in (150 mm) of the lower surface. Done properly, the airflow would tip the wing of the V-1 upwards, overriding the bomb's gyros and sending it out of control into dive.[1] At least three V-1s were destroyed this way.\n\nThe Tempest wing was built up to over 100 aircraft by September; P-51 Mustangs and Griffon-engined Spitfire XIVs were tuned to make them almost fast enough and during the short summer nights the Tempests shared operations with de Havilland Mosquitos. Modified P-47M Thunderbolts (half of their fuel tanks removed, half of their 0.5in [12.7 mm] machine-gun armament, all external fittings and all their armour plate removed) were also pressed into service. There was no need for radar in good weather \u2014 at night the V-1's engine could be heard from 9.9 mi (16 km) or more away and the exhaust plume was highly visible. In poor visibility, radar-equipped Fleet Air Arm (FAA) Fairey Firefly night fighters of 746 Naval Air Squadron based at RAF Ford intercepted the bombs. Wing Commander Roland Beamont had the harmonisation 20 mm cannon on his Tempest changed to converge at 300 yd (270 m), which was so successful that the other aircraft in 150 Wing were also modified.\n\nIn daylight, V-1 chases were often chaotic failures, until a special defence zone between London and the coast was declared in which only the fastest fighters were permitted. Between June and mid-August 1944, the small number of Tempests shot down 638 flying bombs. One Tempest pilot, Squadron Leader Joseph Berry of 501 Squadron, destroyed fifty-nine V-1s and Beamont destroyed 31. Next most successful was the Mosquito (428), Spitfire XIV (303) and Mustang, (232). All other aircraft types combined added 158. The experimental jet-powered Gloster Meteor, which was rushed half-ready into service in July 1944 to fight the V-1s, had ample speed but suffered from unreliable armament and accounted for only 13 bombs destroyed.\n\n#### Squadrons on anti-Diver operations\n\n[edit]- Fighter Interception Unit (detachment), Tempest V, RAF Manston (Kent), merged with 501 Squadron)\n[2] - No. 3 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Newchurch (Kent)\n[2] - No. 56 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Newchurch\n[2] - No. 80 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Manston\n[2] - No. 91 Squadron RAF, Spitfire XIV, RAF West Malling (Kent)\n[2] - No. 96 Squadron RAF, Mosquito NF Mk XIII, RAF Ford (West Sussex)\n[2] - No. 129 Squadron RAF, Mustang III, RAF Brenzett (Kent)\n[2] - No. 165 Squadron RAF, Spitfire IXb + 25 lbs boost, RAF Lympne\n[2] - No. 274 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Manston\n[2] - No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron, Mustang III, RAF Brenzett\n[2] - No. 315 Polish Fighter Squadron, Mustang III, RAF Brenzett\n[2] - No. 322 Squadron RAF, Spitfire XIV, RAF West Malling\n[2] - No. 418 Squadron RCAF, Mosquito FB Mk VI, RAF Hunsdon (Essex)\n[2] - No. 486 Squadron RAF, Hawker Tempest V, RAF Newchurch\n[2] - No. 501 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Manston\n[2] - No. 605 Squadron RAF, Mosquito FB Mk VI, RAF Manston\n[2] - 746 Naval Air Squadron, Firefly Night Fighter, RAF Ford\n[2]\n\n### Deception\n\n[edit]Deception concerning the V-1 was also used against the Germans with double agents. MI5 (by way of the Double Cross System) had these agents provide Germany with damage reports for the June 1944 V-1 attacks which implied that on average the bombs were travelling too far, while not contradicting the evidence presumed to be available to German planners from photographic reconnaissance of London. The bombs had been seeded with radio-transmitting samples to confirm their range but the results from these samples were ignored in favour of the false witness accounts. Bombs were repeatedly set to fly shorter and shorter distances (and further from the intended targets) as a result of this false information.\n\n## End of operations\n\n[edit]In September 1944, Duncan Sandys announced that the \"Battle of London\" against the V-1 was effectively over, as the launch sites in France had been overrun by Allied ground forces. The Germans had prepared sites in the Netherlands, from which they launched V-1 attacks against Antwerp and Brussels starting in October 1944, against which Operation Vapour was mounted. V-2 bombardments began in September 1944, and the last enemy action of any kind on British soil in the war occurred on 29 March 1945, when a V-1 struck an empty field near Datchworth in Hertfordshire.\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- King, Benjamin; Kutta, Timothy (1998).\n*IMPACT: The History of Germany's V-Weapons in World War II*.

After being disbanded in 1919 it was reformed in 1939 flying mainly strike and heavy fighter aircraft until becoming No 1 Squadron in 1958.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### First World War\n\n[edit]The squadron was formed in Italy on 27 September 1918 from flights of the Royal Naval Air Service after that service's amalgamation with the Royal Flying Corps to form the RAF. It flew Sopwith Babies and Felixstowe F3s from Otranto reconnoitring for submarines escaping from the Adriatic Sea into the Mediterranean Sea. The squadron was disbanded on 16 May 1919.[1][2]\n\n### Second World War\n\n[edit]The squadron reformed as a fighter squadron at RAF Filton near Bristol on 2 October 1939, taking over some of No. 605 Squadron's biplane Gloster Gladiator Mk.Is. It became operational towards the end of the year and scrambled for the first time on 12 January 1940. Around this time the squadron received 22 Gloster Gladiator Mk.IIs to replace the Mk.Is[1][3] The Gladiator was obsolete by the time of the Second World War, being only slightly faster than the Heinkel He 111 medium bomber used by the Luftwaffe.\n\n#### Gloster Gladiator and Norway\n\n[edit]Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940 and No. 263 Squadron was soon instructed to prepare for a move. On 20 April, the aircraft were flown, via RAF Sealand, to Scapa Flow, Scotland where Fleet Air Arm pilots landed them on the aircraft carrier HMS *Glorious*[4] and 18 Gladiators sailed for Norway. On 24 April, after two days sailing, the squadron flew its aircraft off the carrier to a landing strip on the frozen lake Lesjaskogsvatnet in Oppland in central southern Norway.\n\nUnfortunately for the enterprise, the squadron was extremely short of ground staff and equipment and few of its Gladiators had been prepared for combat before the Luftwaffe struck with Heinkel He 111s shortly after daybreak on 25 April. By the end of 26 April, although No. 263 Squadron had managed to destroy two Heinkels, all of its aircraft had been destroyed or rendered unserviceable and by the end of the month the squadron was ordered home.\n\nThe re-equipped squadron returned to the far north of Norway on 21 May, flying from Bardufoss airfield, near Narvik, reinforced by No. 46 Squadron whose Hurricanes arrived a few days later, using an airstrip in Sk\u00e5nland Municipality. Due to unsuitable ground at Sk\u00e5nland, 46 Squadron moved so that both were operating from Bardufoss by 27 May.\n\nThe squadrons had been ordered to defend the fleet anchorage at Sk\u00e5nland and the military base at Harstad on the island of Hinn\u00f8ya. Action was short but intense before the squadrons were instructed on 2 June to prepare for evacuation; 263 Squadron had flown 249 sorties and claimed 26 enemy aircraft destroyed. 263's ten surviving Gladiators were landed on HMS *Glorious* on 7 June. *Glorious* sailed but was intercepted by the German battleships *Gneisenau* and *Scharnhorst*. The aircraft carrier was sunk and with it the aircraft from four squadrons. 263 Squadron lost its CO, S\/Ldr John W Donaldson, F\/Lt Alvin T Williams and P.O. Sidney Robert McNamara along with seven other pilots.[1][2][3][5][6] Among the pilots who fought with the squadron in Norway and died on *Glorious*, was F.O. Grant Ede, DFC, one of many Bermudians to serve in the RAF during the war and the first Bermudian to die in the war.[7][8][9]\n\n#### Westland Whirlwind\n\n[edit]The Westland Whirlwind was the first cannon-armed fighter for the RAF, first flown in October 1938 and at the production stage by 1940. It was a twin engined heavy fighter (also able to function as a fighter bomber with 500-pound (230 kg) bombload). With four 20mm Hispano cannon in the nose, it was more powerful than an eight-gunned fighter like the Spitfire or Hurricane. It was fast, matching the current Spitfire's maximum speed, but performed best at low altitude and was used for convoy escort and against small targets in the English Channel and northern France. Only 114 were produced (compared with over 20,000 Spitfires).\n\nNo. 263 Squadron spent the next six months with 13 Group near Edinburgh. It assembled on 10 June 1940 at RAF Drem and after two weeks moved to RAF Grangemouth, where it spent three months before returning to Drem until November and then moving again south to be nearer its intended targets in northern France and the English Channel.\n\nDuring its time in Scotland, it had to sort out the final problems with the Rolls-Royce Peregrine engines and Hispano cannon. To fill the gap the squadron was provided with Hawker Hurricanes which were flown in action a few times. Production of the Peregrine by Rolls-Royce was slow and it was November before the squadron was fully equipped. The squadron transferred to RAF Exeter, commencing Chameleon patrols against enemy E-boats stationed in the English Channel and Western Approaches. The E-boats would rescue German bomber crews who had \"ditched\" in the sea. Here, on 12 January 1941, a section patrolling near the Isles of Scilly located a Junkers Ju 88 and Pilot Officer (PO) Stein was credited with a probable kill.\n\nAs well as its fighter capability, the Whirlwind could operate as a fighter-bomber. In September 1941 S\/Ldr Thomas Pugh, the squadron's 21-year-old commander, suggested that the bombing capability should be investigated, however the idea was initially rejected.[10] Finally, in August 1942 the squadron moved to RAF Colerne in Wiltshire and bomb-racks were fitted to eight aircraft; initially two 250-pound (110 kg) bombs could be carried, and later this was increased to two 500-pound (230 kg) bombs.[10]\n\nNo. 263 Squadron flew Whirlwinds until the end of 1943, with the three years operating the type being spent in the west of the country: two years in airfields around Wiltshire, Dorset and Gloucestershire, six months in south Wales, and six months in Devon and Cornwall. Apart from periods of training and \"rest and recuperation,\" the squadron's operations involved: air-ground attacks on airfields, railways and roads in northern France; air-sea attacks on enemy shipping (E-boats and armed trawlers); sea convoy escort; and bomber escort.[1][2]\n\n#### Hawker Typhoon\n\n[edit]Like the Whirlwind, the Hawker Typhoon 1B was a fighter bomber or strike fighter. Although only powered by a single engine, the Napier Sabre, it was more powerful (2,260 hp) than the two Peregrine (885 hp each) Whirlwind engines. As well as four cannon it could be armed with two (later four) 500 lb (227 kg) bombs or eight \"60lb\" rockets. Like the Whirlwind it performed at its best at lower altitudes.\n\nIn December 1943, 263 Squadron became non-operational while aircrew and ground staff became familiar with the new plane. By the end of the month flying on the Whirlwind had shrunk to 22 hours and over 309 hours had been flown on the Typhoon. After two weeks Armament Practice Camp at RAF Fairwood Common, the squadron became operational again on 1 February 1944 and attacked for the first time on 3 February when three divebombing operations took place.\n\nOn 27 August 1944 the squadron and No. 266 Squadron RAF Typhoons with Spitfire escort was mistakenly ordered to attack the Royal Navy 1st Minesweeping Flotilla off Cap d'Antifer, Le Havre, with the result that HMS *Britomart* and *Hussar* were sunk and *Salamander* was irreparably damaged, killing 117 sailors and wounding 153 more.[11]\n\n#### Cap Arcona\n\n[edit]On 3 May 1945, three ships, the *Cap Arcona*, the *Thielbek* and the *Deutschland*, were sunk as a result of four attacks by Hawker Typhoons of No. 83 Group RAF. After No. 184 Squadron RAF and No. 198 Squadron RAF it was 263 Squadron's, by then based in RAF Ahlhorn (Gro\u00dfenkneten) who were led by Squadron Leader Marten T. S. Rumbold.\n\n## Post-war\n\n[edit]After disbandment on 28 August 1945, No. 616 Squadron RAF with the Gloster Meteor jet fighters was renumbered as 263 squadron at RAF Acklington. After Meteors, 263 Squadron moved onto Hawker Hunters in 1955. The unit arrived at Wattisham in October 1950, and transferred to RAF Stradishall in August 1957. It was disbanded there on 1 July 1958 and renumbered to become No. 1 Squadron RAF. It was reformed for the last time on 1 June 1959 to operate the Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missile at RAF Watton until disbanding on 30 June 1963.[12]\n\n## Aircraft operated\n\n[edit]| Date | Type |\n|---|---|\n| 1918\u20131919 | Sopwith Baby |\n| 1918 | Hamble Baby |\n| 1918\u20131919 | Short 184 |\n| 1918\u20131919 | Short 320 |\n| 1918\u20131919 | Felixstowe F.3 |\n| 1939\u20131940 | Gloster Gladiator I |\n| 1939\u20131940 | Gloster Gladiator II |\n| 1940 | Hawker Hurricane I |\n| 1940\u20131943 | Westland Whirlwind I |\n| 1943\u20131945 | Hawker Typhoon IB |\n| 1945\u20131948 | Gloster Meteor F.3 |\n| 1950\u20131955 | Gloster Meteor F.8 |\n| 1955\u20131956 | Hawker Hunter F.2 |\n| 1955\u20131956 | Hawker Hunter F.5 |\n| 1956\u20131958 | Hawker Hunter F.6 |\n| 1959\u20131963 | Bristol Bloodhound I |\n\n## Organisation\n\n[edit]| Served from | Name | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| October 1939 | Sqn\/Ldr John W Donaldson, DSO, AFC | Missing\/KIA 9 June 1940 aged 29 |\n| 10 June 1940 | Sqn\/Ldr H Eeles | |\n| December 1940 | Sqn\/Ldr Munro | |\n| February 1941 | Sqn\/Ldr Arthur Hay Donaldson, DFC, AFC | |\n| August 1941 | Sqn\/Ldr Thomas P Pugh, DFC | later W\/Cmdr with 182 Squadron MIA\/KIA 2 August 1943 aged 23 |\n| February 1942 | Sqn\/Ldr Robert S Woodward, DFC | MIA\/KIA 7 December 1942 aged 23 |\n| 11 December 1942 | Sqn\/Ldr Geoffrey Berrington Warnes, DSO, DFC | |\n| June 1943 | Sqn\/Ldr Ernest R Baker, DSO, DFC Bar | later W\/Cmdr, MIA\/KIA 16 June 1944 aged 30 |\n| December 1943 | Sqn\/Ldr Geoffrey Berrington Warnes, DSO, DFC | MIA\/KIA 22 February 1944 aged 29 |\n| 25 February 1944 | Sqn\/Ldr Henri A C Gonay | formerly of Belgian Air Force, MIA\/KIA 14 June 1944 aged 30 |\n| June 1944 | Sqn\/Ldr R D Rutter, DFC | |\n| January 1945 \u2013 August 1945 | Sqn\/Ldr Marten T S Rumbold, DFC Bar | 263 Squadron disbanded |\n\n| Arrival | Airfield |\n|---|---|\n| 10 June 1940 | RAF Drem |\n| 28 June 1940 | RAF Grangemouth with detachment at RAF Turnhouse |\n| 2 September 1940 | RAF Drem with detachments at RAF Macmerry and RAF Prestwick |\n| 28 November 1940 | RAF Exeter with detachment at RAF St Eval |\n| 24 February 1941 | RAF St Eval |\n| 18 March 1941 | RAF Portreath |\n| 10 April 1941 | RAF Filton |\n| 7 August 1941 | RAF Charmy Down |\n| 19 December 1941 | RAF Warmwell |\n| 23 December 1941 | RAF Charmy Down |\n| 28 January 1942 | RAF Colerne |\n| 10 February 1942 | RAF Fairwood Common |\n| 18 April 1942 | RAF Angle with detachment at RAF Portreath |\n| 15 August 1942 | RAF Colerne, Northern Ireland |\n| 13 September 1942 | RAF Warmwell with detachments at RAF Predannack and RAF Fairwood Common |\n| 20 February 1943 | RAF Harrowbeer |\n| 15 March 1943 | RAF Warmwell |\n| March 1943 | RAF Predannack |\n| 15 April 1943 | RAF Warmwell |\n| 19 June 1943 | RAF Zeals |\n| 12 July 1943 | RAF Warmwell |\n| 7 September 1943 | RAF Manston |\n| 10 September 1943 | RAF Warmwell |\n| 5 December 1943 | RAF Ibsley |\n| 5 January 1944 | RAF Fairwood Common Armament Practice Camp |\n| 23 January 1944 | RAF Beaulieu |\n| 6 March 1944 | RAF Warmwell |\n| 19 March 1944 | RAF Harrowbeer |\n| 19 June 1944 | RAF Bolt Head |\n| 10 July 1944 | RAF Hurn |\n| 23 July 1944 | RAF Eastchurch |\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]### Notes\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b****c****d****e****f**Rawlings 1969, 1976, 1978. pp. 374\u2013378.**g** - ^\n**a****b**\"History of 263 Squadron\".**c***Royal Air Force*. 2015.

This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's.

On a much larger scale, similar current conversion technology is employed in systems designed for bulk power transmission over extensive distances using direct current at very high potentials.

Many long-distance HVDC systems use sea or ground return for the DC neutral current since this is considerably cheaper than providing a dedicated *metallic return* conductor on an overhead wire or cable. The ground electrode is separated from the converter station so that current returning through the ground electrode does not cause corrosion of parts of the station in contact with the earth.\n\n## Ground connection\n\n[edit]The connection to ground requires a specially designed *ground electrode* (or *earth electrode*).[1][2] The electrode is usually located several tens of kilometres from the converter station in order to avoid possible problems or corrosion in the converter station grounding system. [3] The **electrode line** connects the converter station to the grounding electrode. The electrode line can be implemented, depending upon the location of the electrode (onshore or in the sea), as ground cables, as overhead line, or as a combination of ground cable and overhead line.\n\n## Bipolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are used in most bipolar thyristor-based line-commutated converter (LCC) HVDC transmission systems as a means to improve the reliability of the entire system while also reducing the DC voltage and current ripples. In the event that one of the poles in the bipolar system is faulted, the current path will switch to ground return, thus allowing the system to continue operating at reduced capacity and reducing the possibility that a pole fault will cause a bipolar outage. Usually these ground return paths are only used for very short durations until the faulted pole can be returned to service. The ground current in such schemes can flow in either direction, so the electrodes have to be designed to be reversible, operating either as an anode or cathode. Concerning voltage-source-converter (VSC) HVDC systems, the main reason to use bipolar configurations, especially when the pole-to-pole DC voltages approach 1 MV, is because when one line is faulted in a monopolar HVDC system, the AC phase-to-ground voltages experience peak voltages twice that of normal operation, calling for double the galvanic isolation that is need for normal operation.\n\n## Monopolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are also used in some monopolar HVDC systems, for example the Italy\u2013Corsica\u2013Sardinia scheme.[4] In such systems the electrode line permanently carries the same current as the high-voltage conductor; however since the ground current is then only unidirectional, one of the electrodes (the cathode) can be of simpler design since corrosion is not a problem for cathode electrodes.\n\n## Typical voltages\n\n[edit]The operating voltage of the electrode line usually is in the range of approx. 10-20kV (medium voltage range).[5]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**Arrillaga, Jos; High Voltage Direct Current Transmission, second edition, Institution of Electrical Engineers, ISBN 0 85296 941 4, 1998, pp190\u2013192.**^**Kimbark, E.W., Direct current transmission, volume 1, Wiley Interscience, 1971, chapter 9.**^**M.V.Bakshi U.A.Bakshi,*Elements Of Power Systems*, Technical Publications, 2009, ISBN 8184312679 page 12-26**^**Compendium of HVDC schemes, CIGR\u00c9 Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987.**^**Padiyar, K.

These materials have a processing shape B and a programmed shape A [1]. And when the material is exposed to an appropriate stimulus (in our case: heating above a critical temperature), a one way effect is observed: A \u2192 B (one way effect: 1WE). The objectives of the present study were to find out whether and how often programming can be repeated, whether repeated programming affects the 1WE and how much irreversible strain the material accumulates. We study the effect in dependence of different stress levels, and consider the effect of recovery temperature and recovery time. As a model material we examine the commercial amorphous shape-memory polymer Tecoflex\u00ae and subject it to 50 programming\/1WE cycles. It turns out that programming, cooling, unloading and heating to trigger the 1WE causes an increase of irreversible strain and is associated with a corresponding decrease of the intensity of the 1WE in particular during the first thermomechanical cycles.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nM.

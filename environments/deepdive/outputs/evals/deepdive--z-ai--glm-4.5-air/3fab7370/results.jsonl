This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city. This political figure initially entered the national legislative body following a nationwide electoral contest, which distinctively integrated, for the first time, elected officials from several newly acquired territories. Among these territories was a particular island that gained representation in that election.

This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city. This political figure initially entered the national legislative body following a nationwide electoral contest, which distinctively integrated, for the first time, elected officials from several newly acquired territories.

Guidelines for harvesting forest biomass for energy: A synthesis of environmental considerations.\n\n---\n\nPeople Also Ask:\nQ: How do we harvest energy from biomass?\nA: Most electricity generated from biomass is produced by direct combustion. Biomass is burned in a boiler to produce high-pressure steam. This steam flows over a series of turbine blades, causing them to rotate. The rotation of the turbine drives a generator, producing electricity.\nQ: What are the two methods for harvesting biomass?\nA: The two intensive harvesting methods were a one-pass and a two-pass method. In the one-pass method, all material 1 inch DBH and larger was simultaneously harvested. Pines 1 to 6 inches DBH and hardwoods 11 inches DBH and less were chipped for energy wood and all other stems were logged tree length.\nQ: Why is biomass energy considered sustainable?\nA: It plays a critical role in renewable energy systems because it can be replenished naturally through processes like plant growth, making it a cleaner and more circular alternative to fossil fuels. Biomass encompasses a wide variety of materials, including: Wood and wood products: Firewood, sawdust, and wood chips.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_142899cfb41a4c7b8d7b04e9\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Dalia Abbas\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"biomass harvesting\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"federal forests\\\\\\\" narratives interviews\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"Dalia Abbas\" \"biomass harvesting\" \"federal forests\" narratives interviews","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_9228ec0e89574134887ffc2c\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"biomass harvesting\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"federal forests\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"narratives\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"roadblocks\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"fire risk\\\\\\\" renewable\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"biomass harvesting\" \"federal forests\" \"narratives\" \"roadblocks\" \"fire risk\" renewable","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_181985a83429459d8502000c\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"biomass energy\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"federal forests\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"barriers\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"perceptions\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"stakeholder interviews\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"biomass energy\" \"federal forests\" \"barriers\" \"perceptions\" \"stakeholder interviews\"","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_b5e520c790444623b230827d\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"biomass harvesting\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"federal lands\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"barriers\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"perceptions\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"stakeholder interviews\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"biomass harvesting\" \"federal lands\" \"barriers\" \"perceptions\" \"stakeholder interviews\"","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_ee6800aed2364c51b17f9f9e\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"biomass harvesting\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"federal lands\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"barriers\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"perceptions\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Woody biomass utilization trends, barriers, and ... - Scholars' Bank\nURL: https:\/\/scholarsbank.uoregon.edu\/bitstreams\/942cd81d-51e1-45c9-a879-2ea4fa172a07\/download\nfederal lands.

In addition to the economic\nchallenges facing biomass utilization, USDA Forest\nService managers and staff members have to negoti-\n\n1.  How do trends in national forest biomass removal and local utilization vary across the United\nStates?\n\n2.  What specific barriers have national forest man-\n\nagers and staff found most challenging?\n\n3.  What specific strategies have national forest\nmanagers and staff considered most important\nto overcome these barriers?\n\nTable 1  Biomass utilization categories\n\nAmount of added value\n\nExamples\n\nHigh value products\n\nLow value products\n\nValue-added products\n\nSaw logs, veneer logs, house logs, etc.\n\nPaper pulp and chips for oriented strand board, other composite wood products\n\nPosts and poles, tree stakes, trellises, rustic furniture, spindles, landscaping\nproducts, animal bedding, engineered wood products, wood pellets, etc.\n\nMinimal value products\n\nHog fuel chips and residues for electricity, heat, cogeneration, or liquid fuels\n\nAdapted from USDA Forest Service 2007 (see endnote 2, page 7).\n\n\n\n---\n\n2      Woody biomass utilization trends, barriers, and strategies: A survey of USDA Forest Service managers\n\nWe sought to answer these questions by conducting\na web-based survey of 339 Forest Service district\nrangers and technical staff from across the country. Many results of the survey are discussed in\nsummary form in the journal article. The purpose\nof this working paper is to provide supplemental\nmaterial that could not be reported in the journal\narticle due to space limitation. In particular, we focus on reporting regional differences (see Figure 1,\nbelow) in the specific barriers to biomass utilization\n\nand the specific strategies for overcoming those barriers (in the journal article we used factor analysis\nto cluster similar type of barriers and strategies).\n\nAlthough here we report differences between responses from district rangers and technical staff\nmembers for interested readers (see Tables 2\u20134, pages\n9\u201313), similar to the journal article, we focus the\nresults and discussion on regional differences between respondents. The data collection methods are\ndescribed in detail in our Journal of Forestry article.\n\nFigure 1  U.S. Forest Service administrative regions and regional response to the\n\nonline questionnaire\n\nPacific\nNorthwest\n(R6)\n62% (52\/84)\n\nPacific\nSouthwest\n(R5)\n50% (37\/74)\n\nNorthern (R1)\n59% (44\/75)\n\nIntermountain (R4)\n50% (31\/62)\n\nRocky Mountain (R2)\n75% (44\/59)\n\nEastern (R9)\n56% (35\/62)\n\nSouthwestern (R3)\n50% (31\/62)\n\nSouthern (R8)\n54% (45\/83)\n\nAlaska (R10)\n64% (9\/14)\n\nParenthetical notations indicate Forest Service region numbers.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWoody biomass utilization trends, barriers, and strategies: A survey of USDA Forest Service managers      3\n\nResults\n\nTrends in national forest biomass removal\nand local utilization\nAbout a quarter of all respondents reported that\nthey were unsure what general proportion of biomass utilized locally came from federally managed\nlands. Of the remaining respondents (n=241), more\nthan half (56 percent) reported that less than a quarter of the biomass utilized locally came from federal lands, and only 20 percent reported that more\nthan three-quarters of the biomass utilized locally\noriginated on federal lands. More than 90 percent\nof respondents in the Southern and Eastern regions\nreported that less than a quarter of the biomass\nharvested for utilization in their area came from\nfederal lands. In contrast, between one-third and\ntwo-thirds of respondents from the interior west\nand Alaska reported that more than half of biomass\nharvested for utilization came from federal lands.\n\nNational forest managers and staff members reported different trends in biomass utilization in their\narea for different types of materials (see Table 2,\npages 10\u201311). Most participants in most regions\nreported no recent changes in the utilization of\nhigh-value materials, such as saw logs; although\nnationally, in seven of nine regions, more respondents reported a decreasing trend in high-value\nmaterial utilization than reported an increasing\ntrend. Only in the Southern and Eastern regions\ndid more respondents report that high-value material utilization was increasing than reported it was\ndecreasing. Nationally, the majority of respondents\nalso reported that production of low-value (e.g., paper pulp and chips for composites) and value-added\n(e.g., posts and poles) materials was not changing;\nalthough, nearly twice as many respondents reported an increasing trend in value-added production as reported a decline. Respondents from the\nNorthern region reported a decline in utilization\nof low-value materials, while respondents from the\nPacific Northwest, Southern, and Eastern regions\nreported an increase in utilization of low value materials. Only in Alaska did more respondents report\na decline in value-added production than reported\nan increase. Although nationally the plurality of\nrespondents reported that the utilization of mini-\n\nmal-value materials like residues for electrical and\nthermal energy production was not changing, nearly as many reported an increase in utilization of\nthese materials. The majority of respondents from\nthe Pacific Coast states and the Southern and Eastern regions reported an increase in utilization of\nminimal-value materials, while respondents from\ninterior Western regions reported no changes. Respondents from Alaska tended to report a decline\nin the utilization of minimal-value materials. The\nmajority of technical staff reported an increasing\ntrend, while the majority of district rangers reported no changes in the utilization of minimal-value\nmaterial.\n\nFinally, we asked respondents to report on the trend\nin removal of biomass from their national forest or\nranger district for any purpose. Nationally, half of\nrespondents reported removal of biomass from their\nforest or district was increasing, and only in two\nregions (Rocky Mountain and Intermountain) did\nrespondents tend not to report an increasing trend\nin removal. Overall, relatively few respondents reported a decline in biomass removal from their national forest or ranger district, except in the Alaska\nand the Northern regions where nearly a third of\nrespondents reported a decline. Roughly even numbers of district rangers reported an increase as reported no recent change in biomass removal from\ntheir ranger districts (more than 90 percent total).\nIn contrast, more than twice as many technical staff\nmembers reported an increase in biomass removal\nfrom their forest than reported no change, and only\n15 percent reported a decline.\n\nBarriers to fostering biomass utilization\nRespondents from across the nation rated the high\ncost of transportation, the low market value, lack\nof local markets, low financial returns, high cost of\nharvesting, and lack of existing utilization capacity for biomass as the largest barriers to fostering\nbiomass utilization (see Table 3, page 11). Nationally, these six economic and market barriers were\nrated on average either as \u2018somewhat\u2019 or a \u2018major\u2019\nbarrier to fostering biomass utilization. With few\nexceptions, these six barriers were also among the\nlargest barriers reported for each region. Only in\nthe Eastern region was the lack of existing biomass\n\n\n\n---\n\n4      Woody biomass utilization trends, barriers, and strategies: A survey of USDA Forest Service managers\n\nutilization capacity rated significantly less than\nsomewhat a barrier to fostering biomass utilization.\nThe decline in Forest Service budgets in the Pacific\nNorthwest region and the lack of an existing wood\nproducts industry in the Intermountain West region\nwere also rated significantly higher than somewhat\na barrier to fostering biomass utilization.\n\nRespondents also identified a number of barriers\nthat on average were not seen as hampering efforts\nto foster biomass utilization. Nationally, issues that\non average were rated less than a minor barrier to\nfostering biomass utilization were the nonmarket\nsocial items: the lack of a trained workforce for biomass removal, the need to acquire adequate public\ninput, the need to cross private lands to access biomass on federal lands, the perception that biomass\nprojects will not benefit local communities or create\nlocal jobs, concerns about traffic and noise, competition for labor, and occupational hazards. Regionally, however, there was more variation in issues\nthat were not relevant. For example, disagreement\nabout the need to remove hazardous fuels was not\nan issue that respondents from the Rocky Mountain\nand Southwestern regions considered even a minor\n\nbarrier, while respondents from all other regions\nindicated that it was at least a minor barrier. Similarly, disagreement about the need for forest health\ntreatments in the Rocky Mountain region and lack\nof trust in forest service managers in the Rocky\nMountain, Southern, or Eastern regions were not\nidentified as barriers to fostering biomass utilization. The lack of transportation infrastructure and\nlack of maintenance of Forest Service roads were\nalso not perceived as barriers to fostering biomass\nutilization in the Southern and Eastern regions.\nOnly in Alaska was air quality not reported as a\nconcern.\n\nStrategies for promoting local\nbiomass utilization\nThe most highly rated strategies for promoting local biomass utilization were those that minimized\nthe economic challenges in biomass utilization\n(see Table 4, pages 12\u201313). Nationally, respondents\nrated tax incentives for facility development, harvesting, and transporting biomass and cost share\nand grant programs for facility development and\nequipment purchases as the most important strategies. Regionally, other nonfinancial strategies were\n\n\n\n---\n\nWoody biomass utilization trends, barriers, and strategies: A survey of USDA Forest Service managers      5\n\nalso very important, including developing facilities\nthat source from multiple suppliers in the Northern\nand Pacific Northwestern regions, using hazardous\nfuels and forest health funding in the Southwestern and Pacific Southwestern regions, and undertaking large-scale National Environmental Policy\nAct analyses in the Southwestern region. In the\nAlaska region, several other strategies were rated\nmore highly than the tax incentive strategies, these\nincluded: public-private partnerships for facility\ndevelopment and a focus on small-scale facilities,\npartnerships that help to promote local capacity\nand ensure an adequate supply, government bonds\nand loans, and long-term stewardship contracts and\nagreements. In addition to tax incentives and costshare programs, technical staff members were more\nlikely than district rangers to report that developing\nfacilities that source biomass from multiple suppliers and using hazardous fuels and forest health\nfunding were highly important strategies to promoting biomass utilization efforts locally.\n\nRelatively few strategies were rated lower than\n\u201csomewhat important.\u201d The most common of these\nwas developing agreements with private landowners for access to public land. Regionally, other lowimportance strategies included sourcing biomass\nfrom mill residues in the Southwestern region,\nand developing projects that restore threatened\nand endangered species habitat in the Alaska region. Respondents from the Eastern region also\nrated as relatively unimportant a number of other\nstrategies including improving forest road conditions, developing memorandums of understanding\nto secure federal biomass, procuring biomass from\nother sources like urban wood waste, and hiring\nForest Service staff members to focus on biomass\nremoval projects.\n\nDiscussion\nAlthough Forest Service managers across the country generally reported increasing removal from\nnational forest lands, trends for biomass utilization were highly variable, with increases mostly\nreported for the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, and\nthe Northeast, where utilization capacity remains\nor has grown, while decreases were reported for\nmuch of the Interior West and Alaska, where utili-\n\nzation capacity remains limited or has disappeared.\nThese distinctions highlight the importance of existing industry for promoting biomass removal and\nutilization6 and the lack of sufficient markets and\ninfrastructure to deal with pressing forest health\nand fuels reduction in the Interior West.7 The general pattern of an increasing national trend toward\nutilization of minimal-value products mirrors the\nrecent growth in renewable energy markets, such\nas biomass, that may assist the public investments\nneeded for fuel reduction and forest health restoration across much of the country. We find the reported decline in utilization of minimal-value products\nin the Interior West of concern in the context of\nincreasing fire risk in much of the western U.S.8\n\nNational forest staff members believe that economic\nchallenges and lack of market development are the\ngreatest barriers to promoting biomass utilization,\nalthough possibly slightly less challenging in regions with existing wood products industry and\nmarket infrastructure. Our results provide evidence that Forest Service staff members see high\ntransportation costs, low-market value, and lack of\nexisting industry as the most important challenges\nto promoting biomass utilization.9 The results also\nindicate that Forest Service managers and staff\nmembers consider social factors as minimal barriers to biomass utilization when compared with\nthe more technical, economic, and market barriers.\nNonetheless, social barriers related to public participation, public perception, and not-in-my-backyard\n(NIMBY) attitudes are consistent in case-specific\nliterature about biomass development.10 Although\nspecific social issues may not individually rise to\nthe level of the economic and market barriers, concerns about pollution, nuisances, and forest management together can jointly result in delays or\nshifts in support for utilization projects. Research\nhas suggested that NIMBY challenges can raise development costs for new facilities by as much as 30\npercent.11\n\nThe high relative importance rating of a broad array\nof strategies to promote the utilization of biomass\nsuggests that forest managers and staff members\nare working on multiple fronts to increase biomass\nremoval and utilization. Policy incentives and in-\n\n\n\n---\n\n6      Woody biomass utilization trends, barriers, and strategies: A survey of USDA Forest Service managers\n\nfrastructure development were most important, reinforcing the importance of the \u201cbusiness\u201d of biomass removal and utilization and concurring with\nprevious research that has identified the importance\nof government assistance for developing biomass\nutilization capacity.12 Although many of the social\nissues were not rated as significant barriers, many of\nthe strategies related to building partnerships and\nagreement among stakeholders were rated as important strategies. Partnerships and agreement-building\nalso reflect the historic importance of public engagement processes within the Forest Service and efforts\nto move beyond conflict over forest management.13\n\nIn the Southwest, the importance of existing funding mechanisms and conducting large-scale restoration planning on public lands reflects well-\n\npublicized experiences with community wildfire\nprotection planning and long-term stewardship\nplanning in the Arizona White Mountains.14 The\npredominance of public land in the Intermountain\nand Southwest regions may also help to explain\nwhy diversification of supply is less important in\nthose regions. The wide diversity of highly important strategies focused on partnerships, small-scale\nfacilities, and stewardship in Alaska potentially reflects current collaborative planning efforts in that\nregion. Also notable for nonsignificance is the lack\nof highly important strategies in the Intermountain\nWest and the Southeast. Respondents in these regions rated all strategies with relatively low importance, possibly reflecting the relatively low use of\nmaterials from federal lands for biomass utilization\nin the Southeast and the historic and existing lack\nof forest industry in the Intermountain West.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWoody biomass utilization trends, barriers, and strategies: A survey of USDA Forest Service managers      7\n\nConclusion\nIn this working paper, we add to the material presented in our Journal of Forestry article by providing more detailed information about trends in biomass utilization across the country and the wide\nrange of barriers and strategies important for fostering biomass utilization in and around the National\nForest System.

The environmental impact of\ntrace elements released in coal combustion has become one of the hottest issues in recent years.\nBased on a software named CiteSpace, and social network analysis (SNA), a bibliometric analysis of\nresearch into trace elements in coal and ash \ufb01eld during 1971\u20132017 is presented with the information\nof authors, countries, institutions, journals, hot issues and research trends in the present study.\nThe study results indicate that: (1) Shifeng Dai, Robert B Finkelman, Guijian Liu and James C Hower\nhave a large number of publications with great in\ufb02uence. (2) China (29.8%) and USA (22.2%) have\nhigh productivity in total publications. China and the USA correlate closely in the cooperative web\nsystem. (3) China University of Mining and Technology and Chinese Academy of Sciences take\nthe leading position in the quantity of publications among all research institutions. (4) Energy and\nfuels, engineering and environmental science are three disciplines with the most studies in this \ufb01eld.\n(5) International Journal of Coal Geology, Fuel, Energy and Fuels and Fuel Processing Technology\nare the top four journals with the most publications in this \ufb01eld. (6) The enrichment origin and\nmodes of occurrence of trace elements are the mainstream research related to trace elements in coal\nand ash. The environmental problems caused by coal combustion have promoted the development\nof trace elements in coal research, and human health is getting more and more popular in recent\nyears. The study \ufb01ndings provide a better understanding of features of trace elements in coal and ash\nresearch, which could be taken as a reference for future studies in this \ufb01eld.\n\nKeywords: trace elements; coal; \ufb02y ash; bibliometric analysis; CiteSpace\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCoal is the fossil fuel with the largest reserves in the earth. It is the major power energy in most\ncountries and an important component of the global energy resources [1]. However, the trace elements\nreleased during coal utilization, coal combustion and the toxic elements of combustion products may\nbring serious environmental hazards, which not only pollute the atmosphere, water environment and\nsoil [2\u20134], but also have adverse impacts on human health [5\u20137]. In order to master the characteristics\nof trace elements in coal research, the study adopts the bibliometric analysis software to analyze the\npublications panning the time period of 1971\u20132017 in this \ufb01eld.\n\nAt present, there are many software used for bibliometric analysis, such as Bibexcel, NetDraw,\nSATI, CiteSpace, Pajek and Thomson Data Analyzer (TDA). For example, Zhang et al. adopted\nBibexcel and Pajek software to analyze the progress of study on water footprint [8]; Liu et al. used\nTDA to conduct a statistical analysis on the research status and development trends for sensing and\n\nMinerals 2018, 8, 89; doi:10.3390\/min8030089\n\nwww.mdpi.com\/journal\/minerals\n\nminerals\n\n---\n\nMinerals 2018, 8, 89\n\n2 of 18\n\ncontrol technologies of industrial robots from the viewpoint of patent analysis [9]; Liang et al. applied\nCiteSpace to analyze the publications of acupuncture and moxibustion [10]. CiteSpace was developed\nby Chaomei Chen, a scholar from Drexel University of USA, for visualization analysis of scienti\ufb01c\npublication. Through co-occurrence analysis and co-citation analysis on a large number of relevant\npublications, it can analyze and predict the development trend of a particular study \ufb01eld, and therefore,\nit has been applied in many \ufb01elds [11,12]. CiteSpace supports Chinese and English as well as a variety\nof data formats. Compared to other publication analysis software, it features a vast processing scale\nand is capable of presenting more comprehensive and clear bibliometric analysis results [13,14].\n\nDue to the growing public awareness of environmental protection and the significant potential of\neconomic added-values of valuable elements, the research on trace elements in coal and ash has been\ngrowing in recent years. The purpose of this study is to investigate the implications of the research in this\nfield from 1971 to 2017 based on the bibliometric technique, CiteSpace software and 1534 publications in\nthis field sourced from the Web of Science database. A general profile of leading countries and institutions,\nauthorships and mainstream journals are recognized by the bibliographic statistics. Furthermore,\na summary of the most frequently used keywords obtained from title, author keywords and keywords\nplus analysis provides the indications of discovering the current research emphases and trends.\n\n2. Data and Methods\n\n2.1. Data Description\n\nThis study adopts all databases in Web of Science as the data sources and applies the advanced\nsearch with the sub-formula of TI (Title) = coal* AND TS (Topic) = (trace element* OR harmful element*\nOR toxic element* OR hazardous element* OR critical element* OR valuable element*). The time span\nincludes 1950\u20132017 years and there are 2027 records (the date of the searched data is as of 14 January 2018).\nThe articles, reports, presentations in print forms are not included in the present study because of their\nlimited access to readers.\n\nWhen searching in the Web of Science database, in order to avoid the interference of non-academic\nand invalid publications on the study results and ensure the precision and comprehensive ratio of trace\nelements in coal and ash, the search results are assessed and certain documents are eliminated [15,16].\nFirstly, the information publications are eliminated and the publications from academic journals are\nselected to ensure the credibility of study results. Secondly, select the publications with keywords\nfor relevant analysis on keywords and terms. After screening, each piece of data is downloaded as\nthe full-record text format, and \ufb01nally after deduplication treatment, 1724 valid publications are kept,\nwith a time span of 1971\u20132017, from a total of 47 years.\n\n2.2. CiteSpace\n\nThe study mainly adopts CiteSpace (5.1.R2 SE), which is a free software provided by IBM HTTP\nServer. It can be used to analyze the potential knowledge in scienti\ufb01c studies, present the structure,\nrule and distribution of scienti\ufb01c knowledge in terms of scienti\ufb01c metrology, data and information\nvisualization. It can easily capture the detailed matrix of relations among different objects. The abstract\ninformation is shown by means of visual images [17], which do help to strengthen people\u2019s awareness.\nThe Centrality and Burst of CiteSpace are two important indicators. The Centrality is used to \ufb01nd\nout and measure the importance of the term and mark the key point of node in purple circle in the\nknowledge graph. Burst refers to burst of terms or publications, authors, journals and suddenly added\ncitation information of other node types, which are marked in red in CiteSpace [18]. The TimeLine and\nTimeZone are two important indicators used to re\ufb02ect the frontier and the trend. When CiteSpace is\nadopted to analyze data, in order to make the network graph simple and clear with strong analyzability\nof centrality, the threshold and parameters are selectively set \ufb01rst [19].\n\nIn addition, the study conducts comprehensive analysis mainly on the annual quantity of publications,\nauthors, disciplines, countries, journals, keywords and other aspects. The quantity of publications refers to\n\n\n\n---\n\nMinerals 2018, 8, 89\n\n3 of 18\n\nthe quantity of academic papers. The quantity of publications regarding trace elements in coal and ash in\nunit time reflects the study condition, study level and development speed of this field [20]; the study on\nthe author\u2019s productivity and contribution could investigate the narrative characteristics of the researchers\nof the field. It is especially true for the productive authors with great influence, who always support\nand dominate the development trend of the discipline study. Set the parameters in CiteSpace to conduct\nco-occurrence and co-citation analysis of the authors, so as to make judgment on the quantity of publications\nand cooperation extent among authors based on the thickness of node and connection line [21]; conduct\nsocial network analysis (SNA) analysis on the countries with a large number of publications to analyze the\npublications of each country and the year and cooperation extent of the first cooperation between countries.\nThe analysis results of the research institutions can reflect the constitution of the institution which is at\nthe frontier of a specific study field [22]. Compare indicators of TimeLine and Betweenness Centrality\nof different disciplines to analyze the evolution dynamics of disciplines of a specific field. Analyze the\nfrequently-used keywords, burst of term and frequently-referenced publications to determine the focuses\nand trends of the study on trace elements in coal and ash [23\u201325].\n\n3. Results and Analysis\n\n3.1. Publication Type Record\n\nThere are 1724 records regarding studies on trace elements in coal and ash searched based on Web\nof Science, mainly including paper, meeting proceedings, review, abstract and other publication types.\nAmong them, the paper has the largest proportion, accounting for 86.43% of all records, followed by\nmeeting minutes (15.78%), review (3.6%), abstract (2.03%), and other types of publications (less than 2%).\nThe downloaded data information of text records includes the author, title, year of publication, number of\npages, address, author keywords, and countries\/territories, institutions, journals, citation and discipline\ntypes in Web of Science and so forth.\n\n3.2. Variation Characteristics of Annual Quantity of Publications\n\nAccording to the distribution of annual publications for 2017, the \ufb01rst publication regarding the\nstudy on trace elements in coal and ash was found in 1971 in the database with only one publication\navailable in that year. The annual quantity of publications in 28 years from 1971 to 1998 remained\nstable with a small quantity of less than ten. The study in this \ufb01eld became vibrant since 1999, with\nrapidly increasing quantity of publications, from six in 1998 to 52 in 1999. It is a pity that the valuable\npioneering studies are in print form and have not yet been uploaded onto the internet. The present\nstudy could not assess the pioneering studies. From 1999 to 2016, the quantity of publications \ufb02uctuated\nand reached a relatively low point in 2002, 2005 and 2009, but there was an uptrend as a whole, with\nan average annual growth of eight publications. By 2016, the quantity of publications reached more\nthan 150 and the study became highly vibrant (Figure 1). As there were a small number of publications\nduring 1971\u20131998, the period of 1999\u20132017 is selected as the main study period.\n\nFigure 1.

Results and Analysis 3.1. Publication Type Record There are 1724 records regarding studies on trace elements in coal and ash searched based on Web of Science, mainly including paper, meeting proceedings, review, abstract and other publication types. Among them, the paper has the largest proportion, accounting for 86.43% of all records, followed by meeting minutes (15.78%), review (3.6%), abstract (2.03%), and other types of publications (less than 2%). The downloaded data information of text records includes the author, title, year of publication, number of pages, address, author keywords, and countries\/territories, institutions, journals, citation and discipline types in Web of Science and so forth. 3.2. Variation Characteristics of Annual Quantity of Publications According to the distribution of annual publications for 2017, the first publication regarding the study on trace elements in coal and ash was found in 1971 in the database with only one publication available in that year. The annual quantity of publications in 28 years from 1971 to 1998 remained stable with a small quantity of less than ten. The study in this field became vibrant since 1999, with rapidly increasing quantity of publications, from six in 1998 to 52 in 1999. It is a pity that the valuable pioneering studies are in print form and have not yet been uploaded onto the internet. The present study could not assess the pioneering studies. From 1999 to 2016, the quantity of publications fluctuated and reached a relatively low point in 2002, 2005 and 2009, but there was an uptrend as a whole, with an average annual growth of eight publications. By 2016, the quantity of publications reached more than 150 and the study became highly vibrant (Figure 1). As there were a small number of publications during 1971\u20131998, the period of 1999\u20132017 is selected as the main study period.  Figure 1.

This is because the radar signal will also reflect off of the ground and objects on the ground, causing interference. This is called clutter and can be avoided by Doppler radars that detect velocity.\nQ: What are the radar lines in Canada?\nA: As part of NORAD, major radar lines were built on Canadian territory including the Pinetree Line, Mid-Canada Line, Dew Line, and North Warning system. These lines were used with the support of picket ships, airborne radar, and American radar, and gave warning of an attack on North America.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_eed06ada17d54cfd8b5da697\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Pinetree Line\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Mid-Canada Line\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Dew Line\\\\\\\" RCAF NORAD poor low-altitude detection\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Cleanup of Cold War-era radar bases in Ontario began ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/valleyeasttoday\/posts\/10156753474332328\/\nDuring the Cold War, NORAD set up radar lines across Canada; forming the Pinetree Line, Mid-Canada Line, and DEW Line to detect Soviet threats, ...Read more\n\n---\n\nPeople Also Ask:\nQ: What is the DEW Line in Canada?\nQ: What is the DEW Line warning?\nQ: Why was the DEW Line built?","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_50eec67cf1724aadbb7d48c2\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Pinetree Line\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"separated transmitters receivers\\\\\\\" radar research\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"Pinetree Line\" \"separated transmitters receivers\" radar research","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_c618339e1438468ba2eeaa61\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"separated transmitters receivers\\\\\\\" radar \\\\\\\"low altitude detection\\\\\\\" research\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"separated transmitters receivers\" radar \"low altitude detection\" research","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_386bd6a8a68c43bc82751280\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"radar network\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"communication systems\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"subset\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"designation\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"radar network\" \"communication systems\" \"subset\" \"designation\"","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_ee3cd2354e414b8abdd87d33\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"radar network\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"communication\\\\\\\" subset node terminology\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Coordinated radar resource management for networked ...\nURL: https:\/\/ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1049\/iet-rsn.2013.0368\nby PW Moo \u00b7 2015 \u00b7 Cited by 40 \u2014 To implement coordinated RRM techniques, the radar network relies on a communication channel between radars to transmit and receive data related ...Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 1: DISTRIBUTED OPTIMIZATION OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION ...\nURL: https:\/\/cdcl.umd.edu\/papers\/severson2014.pdf\ndynamically allocate search and track tasking across the radar network [6],[7]. ... communication network with a strongly connected and balanced communication ...Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Timely Target Tracking in Cognitive Radar Networks\nURL: https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/2211.11587\nby WW Howard \u00b7 2022 \u00b7 Cited by 6 \u2014 We consider a radar network composed of multiple in- dependent nodes, a single FC, and limited communication bandwidth.

The\nfirst  reason  is  that  during  my  long  service  in  Punjab  in  the\ncapacity  of  Judicial  Magistrate,  Sub  Divisional  Magistrate,\nto\nAdditional  Deputy  Commissioner  and  Joint  Secretary\nGovernment of Punjab, I have carefully watched and monitored\nall  politico-religious  agitations  and  consequent  developments\nright  from  the  reign  of  late  Partap  Singh  Kairon  to  the  present\nday  government  of  Parkash  Singh  Badal  which  is  still\ncrumblingly  lurking  on  till  this  last  day  of  1998.  The  second\nreason  is  that  during  the  long  stint  of  my  service  in  Punjab  I\nhave  developed  very  close  and  cordial  relations  with  the  top\nleaders of all the political parties especially with the leaders of\nthe  Shiromani  Akali  Dal.  I  have  the  privilege  of  having\n\"personal  close  relations  with  late  Baba  Joginder  Singh,  father\nof  Sant  Jarnail  Singh  Bhindranwale,  Jathedar  Gurcharan  Singh\nTohra,  President  of  the  Shiromani  Gurdwara  Prabandhak\nCommittee and Jathedar\n\nJagdev Singh Talwandi, who had been the President of\nthe Shiromani Akali Dal from 1977 to 1980. He at present is the\nSenior Vice President of Shiromani Akali Dal. Thirdly, being a\npost  graduate  in  Political  Science  and  Psychology  I  have\ndeveloped very keen interest in political affairs and day to day\npolitics.  And,  therefore,  I  have  been  keenly  observing  all\npolitical developments for the last three decades. However, my\nservice  in  the  capacity  of  PCS  officer  in  Punjab  was  simply\nincidental.  Therefore,  whatever  matter  I  have  included  in  this\nbook is either based on my personal conversations held with the\npolitical  leaders  or  my  direct  knowledge derived  from  political\nand other events.\n\n\n\n---\n\nleaders;\n\ntheir  confrontation  with\n\nThese  events  include  intra-contradictions  prevailing\namong\nthe\nthe  Akali\ndiscriminatory Congress governments; their conflicts with Sant\nJarnail  Singh  Bhindranwale;  and  last  but  not  the  least,  Sant\nBhindranwale's'  struggle  against  the  offensive  launched  by  the\nNirankaris  headed  by  Gurbachan  Slngh,  to  subvert  the  Sikh\nreligion.\n\nActivities  of  the  Akalis  carried  out  behind  the  scene\nwere  confided  to  me  by  Jathedar  Jagdev  Singh  \u00b0Talwandi,\nGurcharan  Singh  Tohra  late  Balwant  Singh  and  others  while\nCongress leaders such as Darbara Singh and Beant Singh, both\nlate Chief Ministers, leaked out their own strategies and tactical\nmanoeuvres.  Comrade  Harkishan  Singh  Surjit,  with  whom  I\nhave  had  the  oldest  relations,  kept  me  feeding  with  political\nwheel-deals and other developments that had been taking place\nat  the  national  and  the  state  levels.  Comrade  Surjit,  who  is  a\nvery  shrewd  politician  and  always  keeps  himself  at  the  centre\nstage,  has  been  maintaining  close  relations  with  Badal,  Tohra,\nTalwandi,  Surjit  Singh  Barnala  till  today.  Late  Balwant  Singh\nand  Longowal  always  sought  his  advice  on  all  matters.  Very\noften  than  not  these  leaders  of  all  hues  and  shades  discussed\nsubjects of political interests among themselves collectively and\nseverally.  So  I  used  to  get  continuous  feedback  on  the  latest\npolitical developments through all these leaders.\n\nSo  when  I  touched  a  delicate  and  sensitive  subject  of\nthe  agreement  that  had  been  reached  in  1977  between  Badal,\nTohra and Talwandi that Tohra would be the Chief Minister of\nPunjab,  it  is  not  in  any  way  a  hear  say  story:  Both  Tohra  and\nTalwandi  confidentially  but  separately  revealed  and  confirmed\nthis  episode  of  trust  and  mistrust.  Tohra  was  treacherously\ndeceived and deprived of his just right to ride the chair of Chief\nMinister.  Unfortunately  he  is  still  being  kept  at  bay  by  Badal\nand  his  supporters.  Similarly  when  I  referred  to  the  agreement\nthat  had  been  reached  in  respect  of  Punjab  in  1983  in  the\n\n\n\n---\n\ntripartite  meeting  held  at  Delhi,  from  which  agreement  Indira\nGandhi  had  later  resiled,  is  also  not  a  newspaper  story.  It  was\nconfided  to  me  personally  by  Comrade  Surjit  who  had\nparticipated in that tripartite meeting.\n\nThe purpose of writing this book is twofold. Firstly, it\nis to recall and commemorate the outstanding contribution made\nby  Sant  Jarnail  Singh  Bhindranwale  who  had  raised  the\nemaciated  spirit  of  the  Khalsa.  Secondly,  it  is  for  the  loving\nmemory  of  Sant  Bhindranwale  who  had  made  an  unparalleled\nand unique  sacrifice  in defense of  the faith  and  the philosophy\nof the Khalsa so fondly created and nourished by Guru Gobind\nSingh.\n\nAlthough\n\nthis  book  was  written\n\nin  1985,  after\n\nassassination of Longowal, yet it could not\nbe  published  then,  Now  I  am  prompted  to  publish  it  so  that  it\nmay  precede  or  coincide  with  the  tercentenary  celebrations  of\nbirth  of  the  Khalsa.  I  am  deeply  pained  to  observe  that  those\nleaders  whose  role  during  the  Bhindranwale  time  was  antipanthic,  have  now  come  to  the  forefront  to  farcically  celebrate\nthis auspicious event. And none of these\nfailed  leaders  has  bothered  to  remember  or  even  mention  his\nname.\n\nThey  have  conveniently  forgotten  the  outstanding\nservices  rendered  by  Sant  Bhindranwale  who  has  resuscitated\nthe dead spirit of the Khalsa with his blood. Hence this book is\nbeing  published  on  this  auspicious  occasion  to  refresh  and\nrevive the\nforgotten memory of the gallant defender.\n\nA.R.

As  nature  is\nomniscient  it  manifests  itself  in  animate  and  inanimate  bodies\nand  all  organisms.  Man  incidentally  is  the  most  refined  and\nintelligent  manifestation  of  nature.\nIn  conformity  with\nfundamental  law  of  nature  man  develops  progressively  and  so\ndevelops  his  ideas,  ideologies,  culture  and  religious  beliefs,\neconomic  and  social  systems.  When  old  ideologies  and  social\nvalues  wear  out  they  give  way  to  new  orders  which  are\nrevolutionized  and  developed  by,  great  men  Thus  when\nBrahmanism or in common parlance, Hinduism (primarily based\non Varna system and caste system) which spread untouchability\nand hatred in mankind, became unbearable and irrelevant for the\nneglected  part  of  society  great  redeemer  in  Guru  Nanak  Dev\nwas  born  in  1469  who  tried  to  salvage  the  downtrodden,\nneglected  and  despised  people  by  bringing  about  revolutionary\nreforms  in  the  rotten  system  of  the  country.  Guru  Nanak  Dev\nwas the first great seer who seriously took note of the peculiar\nbut  despicable  caste  system  of  Hindu  Society.  He  out-rightly\nrejected  discriminatory  Varna  and  caste  systems  and  declared\nthat all persons are equal irrespective of their caste, colour and\ncreed.  1n  order  to  give  practical  shape  to  his  philosophy  he\nopened the doors of his new faith to the members of all castes,\ncolour, and creed.\n\nThe  Hindus  believed  and  professed  that  the  Vedas  are\ndivine though these so called revealed scriptures are evil sources\nof despicable Varna system and artificial and irrational division\nof mankind. Guru Nanak Dev Ji discarded the worship of idols,\nand gave up all unnatural rituals professed and followed by the\nHindus. He also spurned mysticism and superstitions prevailing\nin  the  Hindu  Society.  In  short  he  renounced  Hindu  religion  in\n\n\n\n---\n\nunequivocal  terms.  Had  he  condemned  Hindu  religion  and\ndenounced  the  Vedas,  Dharma  Shashtras  arid  Puranas  in  the\ndays of Hindu Raj or Ram Raj, he would have been branded as\nblasphemous  and  crucified.  It  would  have  been  so  because  the\nso called high Caste Hindus are arrogant and intolerant although\nthey claim to be otherwise. The Guru had a remarkable intuitive\npower  and  deep  vision.  That  is  why  he  did  not  install  his  son.\nSiri  Chand,  as  his  successor,  for,  he  knew  that  Siri  Chand  had\nleanings towards mystic Hinduism which the Guru had already\nrenounced.  Instead  he  installed  Bhai  Lehna,  who  was  renamed\nas  Angad,  to  the  Guru  Gaddi  If  Siri  Chand  had  succeeded  his\nfather  Sikh  religion  would  have  relapsed  in  to  Hinduism  long\nago. This presumption was found to be true because Sir] Chand\nfounded  a  Hindu  Sect  known  as  Udasi  whose  followers  are\nrecluse  ascetics  and  passivists.  It  is  evident  that  Siri  Chand's\nUdasi  Sect  was  a  negation  of  Guru  Nanak's  faith  and\nphilosophy.\n\nGuru  Angad  Dev  ji  born  on  31st  March,  1504  at  village\nMata  Di  Sara]  in  Mukatsar  Sub  Division  of  Faridkot  district,\nGuru  Amar  Das  born  on  5th  May  1479  at  village  Basarke  of\nAmritsar  district:  and  Guru  Ram  Das  born  on  24th  September,\n1534  carried  forward  the  light  kindled  by  the  first  Guru  with\nverve and zeal it was Guru Ram Das who laid the foundation of\nholy Sarovar in Amritsar in 1579 on a piece of land purchased\nfrom the residents of villages Gilwali, Sultanwind and Gumtala\nby paving Rs.700.\n\nThe fifth Guru Arjan Dev, born at Goindwal on 15th April,\n1563  made  a  remarkable  and  historic  contribution  to  the\ndevelopment  of  Sikh  religion  by  laying  down  his  life  on  30th\nMay, 1606 in defence of his faith. He compiled the Adi-Granth\nbut  emperor  Jehangir,  a  religious  bigot  and  zealot,  asked  Guru\nArjan  Dev  to  delete  some  matter  considered  by  him  as\nobjectionable from the holy Granth but he refused to oblige him.\nHis  curt  refusal  offended  the  emperor  who  was  further  incited\n\n\n\n---\n\nby Chandu Shah, a Brahmin Minister in the service of Subedar\nof  Lahore  saying  that  the  Guru  had  a  rebellious  proclivity.\nTherefore  the  emperor  declared  Guru  Arjan  Dev  a  rebel  and\naccused  him  of  sedition.  Jehangir  ordered  Guru  Arjan  Dev  to\npay a heavy fine but he refused to submit to him. The infuriated\nemperor  ordered  Chandu  Shah  to  arrest  the  Guru  and  compel\nhim  to  delete  the  \"objectionable\"  material  from  AdiGranth  and\nalso realise the- fine from him. On refusal of Guru Arjan Dev to\nmeet  unwarranted  demands  of  Jehangir,  Chandu  Shah  arrested\nthe  Guru  and  dipped  him  into  a  cauldron  of  boiling  water  and\nthen  lay  him  on.  the  red  hot  iron  pan.  The  Guru  was  thus\nbrutally  tortured  by  Chandu  Shah  the  traitor,  till  he  attained\nmartyrdom on 30th May, 1606.\n\nIt is of great significance to note that Guru Arjan Dev was\nthe first Sikh Guru who was charged with sedition by the Delhi\nDarbar and was also brutally tortured to death. The martyrdom\nof  Guru  Arjan  Dev  was  a  turning  point  in  the  development  of\nSikh  religion.  The  weapon  of  non  violence  and  patience  so\nheroically  practised  by  him  as  well  his  predecessors  totally\nfailed to move the hearts of the Mughal rulers. Now there was a\ndire  need  for  his  successor  to  devise  some  effective  ways  to\nprotect  the  faith  of  Nanak.  Before  attaining  martyrdom  he  had\nalready instructed his son and the successor Guru Hargobind to\nraise  an  army  to  protect  himself  and  his  faith  from  the  enemy.\nHe  also  instructed  him  that  it  was  virtuous  to  lay  down  life\nfighting than to be captured alive and tortured by the enemy. By\nthat  time  Guru  Hargobind  had  fully  realised  that  no  religion\ncould be protected without political power. Therefore he raised\na contingent of armed Sikhs at Amritsar. His army included 800\nhorsemen  and  300  armed  followers  who  were  in  constant\nattendance  on  him.  In  order  to  strengthen  the  Sikh  army  he\ninstructed  his  followers  to  henceforth  present  him  arms  and\nhorses  instead  of  offering  him  other  costly  gifts  at  the  Akal\nTakht.\n\n\n\n---\n\nTo  give  a  permanent  shape  to  his  new  philosophy  Guru\nHargobind  created  the  concept  of  Miri-Piri  and  to  signify  this\ndual authority, he adorned two swords and founded Akal Takht\nopposite  the  Golden  Temple  where  he  installed  two  Nishan\nSahibs  as  a  symbol  of  that  dual  authority.  The  concept  of\nMiriPiri  conveys  the  sense  that  religion  could  not  flourish\nwithout  exercising  temporal  power  and  the  temporal  power\ncould  not  be  exercised  in  right  direction  without  religious\nguidance.  Henceforth  temporal  and  spiritual  powers  became\nintegral  parts  and  pillars  of  Sikh  religion.  It  is  for  this  reason\nthat Guru Hargobind is remembered as a saint-soldier.\n\nAlarmed  by  this  new  development  Jehangir,  the  Mughal\nemperor, asked Guru Hargobind to disband his army and desist\nfrom military exercises but he refused to obey him. As a result\nhe  was  arrested  in  a  surprise  raid  by  the  Mughal  army  and\nimprisoned in the Gwalior Jail. When he was released from jail\nGuru Hargobind became  more  alert  and  vigilant  and never  fell\nin  the  hands  of  Mughals  again  though  he  had  fought  several\nbattles  with  them  It  is  a  proof  of  his  military  genius  that  each\ntime he fought and each time he defeated the Mughal army. By\nhis  successful  military  activities  he  had  virtually  created  a\nseparate  state  within  the  Mughal  Empire.  This  achievement\nenhanced  his  status  and  reputation  among  the  Sikhs.  He\ncommanded  such  a  tremendous  reverence  among  his  followers\nthat  when  he  passed  away  in  peace  on  19th  February,  1645  a\nnumber  of  his  disciples  threw  themselves  into  the  flames  of\nfuneral pyre and perished.\n\nBefore  Guru  Hargobind  passed  away  he  had  raised  and\nmaintained  a  formidable  army  which  helped  him  to  protect\nhimself  as  well  as  his  faith.  Thus  the  concept  of  Miri-Piri  was\nfully established. However his two successors namely, Guru Har\nRai  and  Harkrishan  reverted to the  old  practice  of  nonviolence\nand patience.\n\n\n\n---\n\nGuru  Tegh  Bahadur  succeeded  Guru  Harkrishan  in  1664\nand adorned the swords of his father. He was a combination of\nBhakti and Shakti. He was the first Guru after Guru Nanak Dev\nji  who  travelled  throughout  India  and  inspired  people  to  fight\noppression,  tyranny  and  discrimination  at  all  levels.  His\nmessage  was;  \"Do  not  fear-  anyone  nor  strike  fear  in  anyone.\"\nThe persecution of the Hindus at the hands of the bigoted king\nAurangzeb  created  panic  among  the  Brahmins,  and  in  their\nsearch for a saviour a deputation of the Kashmiri Pundits under\nthe  leadership of  Kirpa  Ram  approached  Guru  Teg  Bahadur  to\nseek his protection. On hearing their vowful wails he decided to\ntake  up  the  cause  of  the  Hindus  to  protect  their  sacred  thread\n(Janeyu) and frontal mark (Tilak). It was for the first and the last\ntime that a prophet of a different religion fought for the religious\ncause  of  another  religion.  This  was  a  fight  for  Dharma,\nrighteousness, in a unique manner. And it was for this cause that\nGuru Teg Bahadur suffered martyrdom on November 11. 1675\nA.D.  alongwith  his  disciples,  Bhai  Mati  Dass,  Bhai  Sati  Dass\nand Bhai Dayala under the orders of Aurangzeb. It is, however,\nan  irony  that whereas Guru Teg Bahadur  sacrificed his  life  for\nthe cause of Kashmiri Pundits, Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of\nIndia,  the  descendant  of  the  same  Pundits,  rewarded  the  Sikhs\nby  launching  military  attack  on  the  Golden  Temple  Complex\nand demolished the Akal Takht.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh succeeded his father in November 1675\nwhen the Sikh religion was almost vanquished by the repressive\nforces  let  loose  by  the  fanatic  and  tyrant  Mughal  emperor\nAurangzeb. It was now an uphill task for Guru Gobind Singh to\nremould and re-inspire the vanquished Sikh army and the faith\nof  Nanak  as  he  was  still  in  teenage  when  he  assumed  Gurt{\nGaddi.\n\nThe martyrdom of his father, caused by brutal torture, made\na  deep  and  indelible  impression  on  the  young  mind  of  Guru\n\n\n\n---\n\nGobind  Singh  His  condition  of  mind  coupled  with  the  fallen\ncondition  of  his  community  and  country  made  him  the\nirreconcilable  foe  of  the  perpetrators  of  atrocities.  For  years\ntogether he studied, meditated and analysed in retrospection the\ncondition  of  Sikh  Panth.  Ultimately  he  conceived  a  new  and\nnoble  idea  of  raising  and  remoulding  the  vanquished  religion\nand community into a militant faith. He assembled his followers\nat Anandpur Sahib on the Baisakhi day of 1699 and announced\nthe  great  object  of  his  mission.  He  declared,  \"Henceforth  the\nKhalsa  alone  shall  prevail.  All  must  become  one;  the  lowest\nwere equal with the highest; caste must be destroyed; they must\naccept \"Pahul\"; \"; and the four castes must eat at one place out\nof  one  vessel.  The  cruel  oppressors  must  be  destroyed  and  the\nidol worship must be stopped. The ways of the Hindus must be\nabandoned. The Brahmin's thread (Janeyu) should be discarded\nand by means of Khalsa alone salvation be attained.\"\n\nFive Principles for Internal Elevation\nGuru  Gobind  Singh  enunciated  five  principles  for  internal\nelevation  o\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_67ff5aee47fd43049b6a6a2f\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Bhai Ranjit Singh\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Gurbachan Singh\\\\\\\" assassination full name\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Gurbachan Singh\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gurbachan_Singh\nAfter the assassination of the Nirankari leader Gurbachan Singh on April 24 ...

The success of this treatment is highly dependent on parameters such as tissue electrical properties, applied voltages and spatial relations in placement of electrodes that are used to establish a cell-permeabilizing electric field in target tissue. Non-thermal irreversible electroporation techniques for ablation of tissue depend similarly on these parameters. In the treatment planning stage, if oversimplified approximations for evaluation of electric field are used, such as U\/d (voltage-to-distance ratio), sufficient field strength may not be reached within the entire target (tumor) area, potentially resulting in treatment failure.\n\n### Results\n\nIn order to provide an aid in education of medical personnel performing electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation, assist in visualizing the electric field in needle electrode electroporation and the effects of changes in electrode placement, an application has been developed both as a desktop- and a web-based solution. It enables users to position up to twelve electrodes in a plane of adjustable dimensions representing a two-dimensional slice of tissue. By means of manipulation of electrode placement, i.e. repositioning, and the changes in electrical parameters, the users interact with the system and observe the resulting electrical field strength established by the inserted electrodes in real time. The field strength is calculated and visualized online and instantaneously reflects the desired changes, dramatically improving the user friendliness and educational value, especially compared to approaches utilizing general-purpose numerical modeling software, such as finite element modeling packages.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we outline the need and offer a solution in medical education in the field of electroporation-based treatments, e.g. primarily electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible tissue ablation. We present the background, the means of implementation and the fully functional application, which is the first of its kind. While the initial feedback from students that have evaluated this application as part of an e-learning course is positive, a formal study is planned to thoroughly evaluate the current version and identify possible future improvements and modifications.\n\n**Keywords:** Education on electroporation, Electromagnetic field visualization, Applications in subject areas, Interdisciplinary projects, Interactive learning environments\n\n## Background\n\n### Electroporation\n\nElectroporation is a term coined in the early 1980's [1] for phenomena already described more than a decade earlier [2], when an interesting property of biological membranes has been observed. Electroporation mainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly composed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short and intense electric fields. The physical mechanism responsible for increased permeability is thought to be the formation of nano-scale defects termed *pores* (thus electro*poration*) in the lipid structure [3,4]. This allows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact mechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is too high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not temporary, but instead result in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversible electroporation. On the other hand, if the cells survive, increased permeability of membrane is only temporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible electroporation. This observed transient increase in permeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of applications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA) delivery, introduction of drugs into cells, fusion of cells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer, gene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of drugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6,7] for an overview. In these applications viability of the porated cells is important and thus irreversible electroporation is consciously avoided and generally considered to be an undesired side effect. However, there are also interesting medical applications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering the domains of industrial [9,10] and environmental [11] applications.\n\n### Electrochemotherapy\n\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that successfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs. For successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate amplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and shape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake and hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been identified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13,14]. The transport of bleomycin across the nonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited [15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and DNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity of bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several thousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is the electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent increase in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to reach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17,18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be eradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be permeabilized, i.e. all cells in the tumor have to be exposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means that the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends on both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high electric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we must consider before we can confidently assume we have successfully electroporated the entire tumor area. First, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue electrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity compared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric field strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields in the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue of electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their shape, size and position. In general, there are two types of electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate electrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with either a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two plates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively, which ensures good electrical contact, but has other drawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure good electrical contact and optimal distance between electrodes to fit the tumor [21,22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous and dependent on their diameter, distance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013 the task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even more arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19,24] and in vivo studies [25] on importance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need for careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted by a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) project, in the scope of which standard operating procedures for ECT were published [26]. However, in advanced cases such as intracranial [27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need for patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29,30].\n\n### Non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation and other techniques\n\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation. While the high number of applied pulses used to achieve classical irreversible electroporation may also cause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the current-conducting tissue, non-thermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since it results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and no protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical applications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is technically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of chemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison to other ablation methods such as RF ablation or cryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the connective structure [8,32]. Since it has been observed that NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves, there is hope of using this technique in treatment of tumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as this treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of ECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure adequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other minimally invasive therapies for treatment of deep-seated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g. high intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation. The latter is a minimally invasive procedure where a needle electrode is inserted percutaneously into a tumor, much as in ECT or NTIRE. The electrode acts as an antenna for electromagnetic waves emitted by a generator; the tumor is heated up and thereby destroyed [34]. As with NTIRE or ECT, the need for accurate needle placement exists and its importance has been evaluated. Success, i.e. improved treatment, has been proven to be correlated to the experience of the operator [34].\n\n### The need for education on electroporation\n\nAs outlined in the paragraphs above, both reversible and irreversible electroporation are promising approaches in treating solid tumors, however their success is highly dependent on local field strength. Poorly defined or unknown properties such as tissue conductivities and inhomogeneities in addition to our choice of electrode type, positions and pulse amplitudes, affect the electric field distribution. With many factors to take into consideration, we may dismiss important uncontrolled variables or use a well-studied but irrelevant model that cannot be applied to a specific situation. An example of this is the persistent use of a very simple approximation for electric field strength that holds only under very particular conditions. This frequently used approximation equates the electric field strength *E* to the voltage *U* applied on the electrodes divided by the distance *d* between the electrodes, i.e. *E* \u2248 *U*\/*d*. Since the local electric field strength has been identified as the key factor in achieving both reversible and irreversible electroporation (see [19] for details), i.e. local *E* has to reach a certain threshold value *E*rev or *E*irrev, it is the parameter we most often optimize our electrode configuration for. There is a problem, however, since this simple relation is strictly valid only in an isotropic homogeneous medium between two infinitely large parallel plate electrodes. When using parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this simple model best approximates the actual field strength far from the electrode edges, provided the electrode width is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results are even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of course there are no parallel plates to speak of (see Figure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore, using the simple parallel plate approximation for *E* in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result in significant reduction of response in treatment for which the complete response rate has been shown to be as high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way into more and more clinics worldwide [36-39] and establishing themselves as safe and effective treatments of cancer, it is becoming more and more important that medical personnel performing and planning ECT (or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action, the underlying physics and possible pitfalls. This paper presents an application for visualization and analysis of the electric field strength in multiple-needle-electrode electroporation aimed at users with basic knowledge of the principles of electroporation, but lack of education in physics and engineering who may therefore need visual, interactive and didactic instruments to gain a deeper understanding of the principles necessary for effective use of these promising treatments. Since educational applications of the sort are scarce and research is focused primarily on advancing the field rather than educating, the need to explore options and applications in this area of engineering education seems pressing and applicative results should be welcome. The application is part of a now firmly established annual course Electroporation Based Technologies and Treatments, EBTT (http:\/\/www.ebtt.org). The e-learning laboratory exercise into which the presented application has been incorporated, has been developed and described previously [40].\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Theoretical background\n\nThe theoretical background for the mathematical engine that is at the heart of our application has been derived from the electrostatic field theory, more specifically, extended from a solution for electrostatic potential generated by two long parallel charged conductors given in [41]. We have omitted the detailed mathematical derivations here as they are outside the scope of this paper; however, we have included a derivation of the equations below in the Appendix for those readers that may be interested in further development or modifications to our model. Below, we specify only the final formulation of the mathematical model and the method of application of this analytical solution into the field-calculating engine that represents the core of Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation (ApiVizTEP), since this is the only essential part of the application around which the user interface is built. Similarly to the approach that we present in this paper, other analytical models have been developed previously using complex analysis. For a six-needle array, one may find a first-order analytical approximation for the electric field strength in [42]. Other authors have expanded on this approach further, see e.g. [43] and [44]; however, these solutions do not give an accurate analytical expression for the electric field strength since quite possibly such a solution cannot be obtained for three or more electrodes active concurrently at a given time. Since currently electroporation devices mostly power only one pair of electrodes at a time [45], we have not pursued a solution with more than two concurrently active electrodes, thus avoiding the derivation of an approximate solution. Instead, we give an accurate solution for a two needle electrode system that is not based (mathematically) on previously published work.\n\nThe accurate analytical solution for electric field strength of two long parallel cylindrical conductors (needle electrodes) on a plane perpendicular to the conductor longitudinal axis (2-D solution), is given by the following equation\n\n*V*AB is the voltage on an electrode pair (anode\u2013cathode), *d*AB is the distance between the electrodes, *\u03c1*0 is the electrode diameter, while *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B are coordinates of the center of the electrode mathematical equivalents (the electrical center *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B of the electrodes is eccentric to the actual geometrical center *x*A, *y*A and *x*B, *y*B due to finite i.e. non-zero electrode diameter).\n\nOur application employs a mesh of 400 \u00d7 400 points and the electric field strength *E* is calculated for each of the 160.000 points using the expression above. The time needed to perform the necessary calculations and display the results is practically negligible, ranging from a few hundred milliseconds for two active electrodes up to one and a half seconds for twelve active electrodes using an average modern personal computer, i.e. at least a dual core 2 GHz processor equipped with 2 GB of memory or more. It needs to be emphasized that while the application allows for inclusion of up to twelve electrodes distributed into one to six groups with variable voltages, the application fundamentally breaks down these groups into anode\u2013cathode pairs and calculates the electric field strength by means of the equations above for every pair. It then searches this set of results to obtain the maximum value of the electric field in each of the 160.000 points. This value represents the final solution in that point, since what we are interested in is determining the maximum value for the local field strength. In this way we have eliminated the need for a solution for the electric field of more than two concurrently active electrodes. Such an approach is justified by the fact that we have already mentioned \u2013 i.e. currently electroporation devices only power two electrodes at the same time.\n\n### Tools and platforms\n\nThe application has been written in C# programming language in the Microsoft\u00ae Visual Studio 2010 integrated development environment. The library used was the Microsoft\u00ae .NET Framework version 4. The development environment and base library have both been selected based on personal preference and possibilities that are enabled by the enhancements in these tools concerning ease of graphical user interface (GUI) development by separating the markup that describes the GUI elements from programming logic that provides the functionality.\n\nThe internet version of the application is hosted on a semi-open platform, since a Microsoft\u00ae Windows operating system is hosting an Apache\u2122 HTTP Server web server with installed PHP support and a free edition of Oracle\u00ae MySQL, providing a web interface to basically the same, though slightly modified and recompiled, engine as in the desktop version.\n\n## Results\n\nThe application that we developed has been named Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation, or ApiVizTEP in short. It is a Microsoft .NET application bundled into an installation package together with the .NET Framework version 4 Client Profile redistributable installation, which enables the user to install the application locally, provided the machine hardware and operating system support this prerequisite framework, as do most modern Windows operating systems installed on compatible hardware.\n\nAt the start the application presents itself with a navigational panel on the left-hand side of the window and a help panel to the right (see Figure 2).\n\nThe help panel contains instructions on locating the configuration of the system, i.e. directs to the *config* and *settings* panels. These contain various model and system settings that we describe here briefly: It is possible to include from two up to twelve needle e\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_d8f961681c9f4251b389fcf7\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Educational application for visualization and analysis of electric field strength in multiple electrode electroporation\\\\\\\" Slovenia authors Faculty Electrical Engineering\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Educational application for visualization and analysis of ...\nURL: https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC3528424\/\nby S Mahni\u010d-Kalamiza \u00b7 2012 \u00b7 Cited by 57 \u2014 Educational application for visualization and analysis of electric field strength in multiple electrode electroporation.

From my search, I found that RADWIMPS is a Japanese rock band that has songs in both Japanese and English versions. Their song \"Saihate Ai ni \/ Sennou\" was released in 2017, and they have collaborated with ONE OK ROCK's Taka.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the producer and entertainment firm**\nYojiro Noda (RADWIMPS vocalist) acted as a record producer. RADWIMPS was signed to EMI Music Japan, which later merged into Universal Music Japan in 2013.\n\n**Step 3: Stock exchange listing**\nUniversal Music Japan's parent company, Universal Music Group, has connections to stock markets. However, the riddle mentions a \"domestic automated quotation system\" that was benchmarked against a major North American market. This likely refers to the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), which is benchmarked against the NASDAQ.\n\n**Step 4: Major index including semiconductor company**\nThe riddle mentions a key index featuring large non-financial companies from a North American market that included a multinational semiconductor enterprise during an annual component review. This sounds like the S&P 500, which includes semiconductor companies.\n\n**Step 5: Semiconductor company specializing in data conversion**\nFrom my search, Analog Devices (ADI) is a multinational semiconductor company that specializes in data conversion products like ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters) and DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters).\n\n**Step 6: Devices that measure proper acceleration**\nAnalog Devices historically manufactured accelerometers, which are devices that measure proper acceleration (g-force). Their ADXL50 was one of the first surface micromachined accelerometers sold in 1993.\n\n**Step 7: Miniaturized technology - MEMS**\nWhen accelerometers are miniaturized, they exemplify MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) technology.\n\n**Step 8: Common application using piezoelectric methods to deposit material**\nThe final question asks about a common application of this microscopic technology that uses piezoelectric methods to deposit material. From my search results, I found that **inkjet printing** is a common application that uses piezoelectric methods to deposit material (specifically piezoelectric inkjet printing for depositing thin films and other materials).\n\nThe MIT research paper and other sources confirm that inkjet printing of piezoelectric materials like PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) thin films is a key application that uses piezoelectric methods for material deposition in MEMS technology.\n\n\\boxed{inkjet printing}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":77496.5641498566,"scoring_ms":400.3672599792,"total_ms":77896.9314098358,"info":{"raw_question":"Consider a song by an Asian rock band, known in two language versions and produced by a prominent musician from a contemporary group, whose peninsular iteration was released by an entertainment firm.

Plunkett discovered fluoropolymers by accident. On working with fluorocarbon gasses, he opened the valve to one gas cylinder, but found that no gas came out of it. Upon cutting the cylinder open, he then discovered a white waxy substance which didn't melt or dissolve.\nQ: When was PVDF invented?\nA: Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) began as a mid-20th-century curiosity and quickly became a workhorse. DuPont patented PVDF in 1948, but the resin's commercial story took off in the 1960s when Pennsalt\/Pennwalt scaled Kynar\u00ae PVDF, including a landmark plant in Calvert City, Kentucky.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_ac650a59035042e1ae07703a\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"fluoropolymer\\\\\\\" melt flow extensional stress history computation optical applied polymer science journal before 1990\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Capillary extrusion flow of a fluoropolymer melt\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/251410860_Capillary_extrusion_flow_of_a_fluoropolymer_melt\nThe capillary extrusion-forming flow of a fluoropolymer (FEP) melt was studied both experimentally and numerically.

The challenge is to be able to link materials behavior and seek patterns among multiple length and time scales. Materials informatics and statistical learning techniques permit one to survey complex, multiscale information in an accelerated and statistically robust and yet meaningful manner. When this is coupled with advanced tools for computational thermodynamics and kinetic simulations, the result is a powerful computational infrastructure for materials design. This paper provides an overview of the value of this integrated approach to materials modeling in addressing the challenges in linking length scales.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nZ.-K.

This issue spurred the development of new remote access protocols. One such intermediate protocol, which verified a user's ability to receive mail before allowing them to send, was itself superseded. This successor protocol, standardizing sender login, is fundamental to the operation of a type of software agent that processes outgoing mail from the user's application, often using a distinct, designated communication channel. This agent, in turn, cooperates with a different agent for the actual routing of messages between various computer systems. While this routing agent functions in the background, the end-user interacts directly with software acting on their behalf. If such user-facing software, exemplified by a web navigation application on a specific model of tablet computer from the early 2010s, transmits an identification string, what particular sequence of characters and numbers, denoting the core rendering engine technology it is built upon, would appear after the details specifying the device and its operating system, but before any mention of compatibility with other rendering engines?\nReason step by step using the given tools and provide the final answer in \\boxed{}.","role":"user"}],"completion":[{"content":"I need to work through this complex riddle step by step.

You can ensure that your website looks and works great on iPad, and even create new touch-enabled web experiences for your customers, by considering a few specific differences between iPad and other platforms.\n\nIf you have access to an iPad, test your website using the iPad. If not, you can test your website in Safari on OS X, instructions are given below.\n\n## Safari on iPad Readiness Checklist\n\n### 1. Test your website on iPad, and update user agent detection code if necessary\n\nMany websites perform server-side checks on the browser's user agent string to determine whether or not they should serve the mobile version of their website. Safari on iPad is capable of delivering a \"desktop\" web experience, and users will expect this experience since iPad has a large screen and fast network connectivity. If you have a version of your website that is optimized for mobile devices with small screens, do NOT serve this mobile version to iPad users.\n\nListing 1 shows the Safari on iPad user agent string. It identifies the version of Safari that is running on iPad, and iPad is identified as a mobile device.\n\n**Listing 1** Safari on iPad user agent string in iOS 7.0 SDK\n\nMozilla\/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit\/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version\/4.0.4 Mobile\/7B334b Safari\/531.21.10 |\n\nNote that the Safari on iPad user agent string contains the word \"Mobile\", but does not contain the word \"iPhone\". If you are currently serving mobile content to any browser that self-identifies as \"Mobile\", you should modify your user agent string checks to look for iPad and avoid sending it the wrong version of your site. The version numbers in this string are subject to change over time as new versions of Safari on iPad become available, so any code that checks the user agent string should not rely on version numbers.\n\n#### Simulating Safari on iPad HTTP requests in Safari on the desktop\n\nIf you're unable to test with an iPad or iPhone Simulator, you can simulate an HTTP request from Safari on iPad in Safari on a desktop computer. First, load your website in Safari on OS X. Then, enable the checkbox next to \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" in Safari's Advanced Preference pane, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nNext, select **Develop > User Agent > Other** from the Safari menu. You will be prompted to enter a user agent string. Copy the Safari on iPad user agent string above, then paste in it into the dialog box that appears, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nWhen you click \"OK\", the User-Agent field in any HTTP request headers will be set to the string that you just entered, and the page will automatically reload. When the page reloads, you should verify that you're **not** serving the mobile version of your website to iPad. You can verify that the Safari on iPad user agent string was sent to your server by inspecting request headers in the Resources pane of Safari's Web Inspector, as shown in Figure 3. This user agent string setting persists on a per-window basis.\n\n### 2. Use W3C standard web technologies instead of plug-ins\n\nPlug-ins are not supported in Safari on iPad, nor are they supported in Safari on iOS.\n\nIf you're using a plug-in to display user interface elements such as menus or other navigation elements on your website, these elements will not be accessible to users of Safari on iOS. Be sure to include a code path for platforms that do not support plug-ins, and for users on desktop platforms such as OS X that may have plug-ins disabled.\n\nIf you're using a plug-in to embed audio or video in a webpage, you can use the HTML5 `<audio>`\n\nand `<video>`\n\ntags to deliver audio and video content in Safari on iOS. These tags work seamlessly with *HTTP Live Streaming Overview*, and it is easy to structure your HTML to fall back to plug-in content in browsers that don't support these elements. For more information on using HTML5 `<audio>`\n\nand `<video>`\n\ntags, see the *Safari HTML5 Audio and Video Guide*, and the `HTMLMediaElement`\n\n, `HTMLVideoElement`\n\n, and `HTMLAudioElement`\n\nclass references in the *Safari DOM Extensions Reference*.\n\nIf you're currently using a plug-in to draw animations in your webpages, you can use a combination of JavaScript and CSS3 transforms, transitions, and animations to create animations in Safari on iOS. For more information on how to use CSS to create rich animations in webpages, see the *Safari CSS Reference*, the *Safari CSS Visual Effects Guide*, and \"Audio, Video, & Visual Effects\" sample code at the Safari Dev Center.\n\n#### Testing without plug-ins in Safari on the desktop\n\nIf you're unable to test with Safari on an iPad or using the iPhone Simulator, you can verify that your website works well without plug-ins in Safari on the desktop. Begin by disabling the checkbox next to \"Enable plug-ins\" in Safari's Security Preference pane, as shown in Figure 4.\n\nNext, visit your website. Elements on webpages which use plug-ins may be replaced with messages advising you to download or upgrade the required plug-in. In Safari on iOS, these areas may be blank.\n\n### 3. Check your viewport tag settings\n\nIf you've specified viewport settings for your webpage in Safari on iPhone, verify that these same settings are suitable for Safari on iPad. Specifically, if you want the width of the viewport to match the width of the device, you should use the `device-width`\n\nconstant instead of a hard-coded pixel value. For example, many websites use the setting shown in Listing 2 to set the viewport to a width that they consider suitable for iPhone.\n\n**Listing 2** Incorrect: Using a pixel value for viewport width.\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=320\" \/> <!--- WRONG \/\/---> |\n\nUsing the `device-width`\n\nconstant as shown in Listing 3 is a much better approach, as it will set the viewport to the width of the current device.\n\n**Listing 3** Correct: Using a constant for viewport width.\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\" \/> |\n\n### 4. Modify code that relies on CSS fixed positioning\n\nCSS fixed positioning works in Safari on iPhone and iPad, but not as you might expect. While elements that use fixed positioning in Safari on OS X always stay on screen, elements that use fixed positioning in Safari on iPhone and iPad can end up offscreen as users zoom and pan the webpage. Why does this happen?\n\nBy definition, the containing block of a webpage element that uses CSS fixed positioning is the viewport. This means that when you set `position: fixed`\n\nwith a `bottom`\n\nand `right`\n\nvalue of `20px`\n\nas shown in Listing 4, you have \"fixed\" the position of an element 20 pixels above the bottom edge of the viewport, and 20 pixels from the right edge of the viewport.\n\n**Listing 4** CSS fixed positioning.\n\n#fixed { |\nposition: fixed; |\nright: 20px; |\nbottom: 20px; |\nheight: 100px; |\nwidth: 100px; |\nbackground-color: purple; |\n} |\n\nIn Safari on the desktop, the viewport is analogous to the window \u2014 as you resize a window, you are resizing the viewport. As you scroll, you are scrolling the viewport. Hence, in Safari on OS X, the element always stays on screen.\n\nSafari on iPad and Safari on iPhone do not have resizable windows. In Safari on iPhone and iPad, the window size is set to the size of the screen (minus Safari user interface controls), and cannot be changed by the user. To move around a webpage, the user changes the zoom level and position of the viewport as they double tap or pinch to zoom in or out, or by touching and dragging to pan the page. As a user changes the zoom level and position of the viewport they are doing so within a viewable content area of fixed size (that is, the window). This means that webpage elements that have their position \"fixed\" to the viewport can end up outside the viewable content area, offscreen.\n\n### 5. Prepare for a touch interface\n\nAlthough an external hardware keyboard is an option for use with iPad, the primary means of interacting with web content in Safari on iPad is through touch. The software keyboard appears in Safari on iPad and iPhone when a form control that requires text input \u2014 such as `<input type=\"text\">`\n\nor `<textarea>`\n\n\u2014 gains focus. Users should not be forced to rely on a keyboard to navigate your webpage.\n\nAdditionally, Safari on iOS users interact with your web content directly with their fingers, rather than using a mouse. This creates new opportunities for touch-enabled interfaces, but does not work well with hover states. For example, a mouse pointer can hover over a webpage element and trigger an event; a finger on a Multi-Touch screen cannot. For this reason, mouse events are emulated in Safari on iOS. As a result, elements that rely only on `mousemove`\n\n, `mouseover`\n\n, `mouseout`\n\nor the CSS pseudo-class `:hover`\n\nmay not always behave as expected on a touch-screen device such as iPad or iPhone.\n\nYou can handle touches directly or even detect advanced gestures in Safari on iOS, using the DOM Touch events `touchstart`\n\n, `touchmove`\n\n, `touchend`\n\n, and `touchcancel`\n\n. Unlike mouse events which are emulated, DOM Touch events are specifically designed to work with touch interfaces, so their behavior is reliable and expected. For more information on using touch events in web content for Safari on iOS, see the \"Handling Events\" section of the *Safari Web Content Guide*, the `Touch`\n\n, `TouchEvent`\n\n, and `TouchList`\n\nclasses in the *Safari DOM Extensions Reference*, and the SlideMe sample code at the Safari Dev Center.\n\nSince touching and holding in Safari on iOS will invoke the Cut\/Copy\/Paste dialog, you may also choose to disable selection on user interface elements such as menus and buttons using `-webkit-user-select: none`\n\n. It is important to only disable selection as needed on a per-element basis. Selection in webpages should **never** be globally disabled.\n\n#### Document Revision History\n\nDate | Notes |\n|---|---|\n| 2014-05-01 | Updated figures and removed section about content editable. |\n| 2010-03-09 | Updated documentation links. |\n| 2010-03-05 | Updated documentation links. |\n| 2010-03-03 | New document that describes platform-specific considerations for web content in Safari on iPhone OS, with specific information for iPad. |\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.

These SMTP servers allowed anyone to send email through them without authentication, which became problematic for spam and abuse.\n\n## Step 2: Development of Remote Access Protocols\nThe unrestricted forwarding issue spurred development of authentication protocols. One intermediate protocol \"verified a user's ability to receive mail before allowing them to send.\" This describes **POP before SMTP** (or SMTP after POP), where users had to check their mail first via POP3 before being allowed to send via SMTP.\n\n## Step 3: Superseded Protocol\nThe riddle states this intermediate protocol \"was itself superseded.\" POP before SMTP was indeed replaced by **SMTP AUTH** (RFC 2554), which standardized sender login using SASL mechanisms.\n\n## Step 4: Successor Protocol and Software Agent\nThe successor protocol \"is fundamental to the operation of a type of software agent that processes outgoing mail from the user's application, often using a distinct, designated communication channel.\" This describes the **Mail Submission Agent (MSA)**, which uses SMTP AUTH to authenticate users and handles outgoing mail submission.\n\n## Step 5: Agent Cooperation\n\"This agent, in turn, cooperates with a different agent for the actual routing of messages between various computer systems.\" The MSA works with the **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)** for inter-server message routing.\n\n## Step 6: End-User Interaction\n\"While this routing agent functions in the background, the end-user interacts directly with software acting on their behalf.\" This refers to the **Mail User Agent (MUA)**, such as a web browser or email client.\n\n## Step 7: Web Navigation Application on Early 2010s Tablet\n\"If such user-facing software, exemplified by a web navigation application on a specific model of tablet computer from the early 2010s...\" This points to **Safari on iPad** from the early 2010s.\n\n## Step 8: Identification String and Rendering Engine\nThe question asks about \"what particular sequence of characters and numbers, denoting the core rendering engine technology it is built upon, would appear after the details specifying the device and its operating system, but before any mention of compatibility with other rendering engines?\"\n\nFrom the Apple documentation, the iPad user agent string from the early 2010s (iOS 3.2) is:\n`Mozilla\/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit\/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version\/4.0.4 Mobile\/7B334b Safari\/531.21.10`\n\nThe sequence that denotes the core rendering engine technology appears after the device\/OS information and before compatibility mentions is: **`AppleWebKit\/531.21.10`**\n\nThis identifies the WebKit rendering engine version that Safari on iPad uses to render web content.\n\n\\boxed{AppleWebKit\/531.21.10}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":70696.2878704071,"scoring_ms":401.5419483185,"total_ms":71097.8298187256,"info":{"raw_question":"Begin with an early email server type known for its unrestricted forwarding, a characteristic that became problematic.

This district consists of the northern and north-eastern outskirts of the main city of Phnom Penh, stretching from Khan Sen Sok in the west to the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River in the east. As of 2019, it is the most populous district of Phnom Penh.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Two legends of the Royal Chronicles: the origins of the Emerald Buddha\n\n[edit]There are two occurrences of Russey Keo in the Cambodian Royal Chronicles.\n\nThe first occurrence is in the story of legendary king Baksei Chamkrong; Baksey Chamkrong escapes from Angkor and finds refuge on Phnom Baset, southwest of Oudong, before fleeing to the island of Russey Keo where he was surrounded by his opponents.\n\nThe second occurrence of Russey Keo mentions this area as the settlement of Buddhagosa, who landed on Russey Keo after a storm disrupted his travels sailing from Langka to Laos. It is during this trip that he was travelling with various treasures, \"jewels of sacred fire\", such as several sacred texts of the Pali canon the *Ounalom,* Buddha's synophrys or unibrow, which gave their name to two local pagodas Wat Ounalom and Wat Langka. The Khmer King Batum Soryavong then came to help these settlements, and invited the monk to settle in Angkor with the statue of the Emerald Buddha,[2] the *Phra Kaeo Morakot,* etiologically giving its name to the area.[3]\n\n### The foreigner's settlement along the Tonle Sap since the 17th century\n\n[edit]Russey Keo, on the banks of the Tonle Sap River, is where the Dutch merchants established in the 17th century, given its name to one of the neighbourhoods of the district, *Hoaland.* The Catholic missionaries established their first parish called Saint Joseph's Catholic Church through a gift of land from King Norodom in 1867.[4] Russey Keo district, soon became a gathering point for Annamites of all religious persuasions, the home of Phnom Penh cathedral and many pagodas.[5]\n\n### The dredging and developing of a new urban neighbourhood since 1990\n\n[edit]Russey Keo has experienced dramatic urban development since the 1990s, including land reclamation. In March 1991, the People's Committee of Phnom Penh recommended the dredging of zones in Russey Keo, and in May 1991, the Cabinet Council of Ministers of Cambodia authorized the pumping of sand to enlarge the city. These developments have also giving rise to forced evictions[6] and a certain number of land disputes, as those between collective groups of people and their Chief of Village who allegedly sold communal land and kept the money.[7] Among these major developments, Camko City is an urban development zone being developed by a consortium spearheaded by World City Co., Ltd of South Korea in the Russey Keo district. It has a projected investment valued at $2.063 billion.\n\n## Administration\n\n[edit]According to the 1998 census, Russey Keo consisted of 12 communes (*sangkats*) with a total population of 180,076;[8] in 2008\u20132009 three *sangkats*\u2014Khmuonh, Phnom Penh Thmei and Tuek Thla\u2014formed Khan Sen Sok[9] and the population recorded by the 2008 census in the resulting nine-Sangkat area was 175,295.[10]\n\nIn 2008, the number of *Khans* (districts) in Phnom Penh increased from 7 to 8, with the division of Russey Keo District into two: Russey Keo and Sen Sok.[11]\n\nIn 2010, Bak Kaeng and Koh Dach communes were added to the Khan from Mukh Kampul District, Kandal Province.[12]\nIn 2013, both *sangkats*, along with Chroy Changvar, Preaek Lieb and Preaek Ta Sek, formed a new entity, Khan Chroy Changvar,[13] taking Russey Keo's number of Sangkats to six. In 2016, Tuol Sangkae was split in two separate Sangkats, Tuol Sangkae I and Tuol Sangkae II.[13]\n\nAs of 2020, Russey Keo is subdivided into seven communes (*sangkats*) and 30 villages (*phums*).[13]\n\n| Geocode | Commune | Village |\n|---|---|---|\n| 120703 | Svay Pak | La Kambaor, Lu, Svay Pak |\n| 120704 | Kilomet Prammouy | Kraol Kou, Spean Khpos, Boeung Chhuk |\n| 120706 | Russey Keo | Mittapheap, Samakki, Khleang Sang, Boeung Salang |\n| 120711 | Chrang Chamreh I | Phum I, Phum II, Phum II, Phum IV |\n| 120712 | Chrang Chamreh II | Phum Ka, Phum Kha I, Phum Kha II, Phum Koa |\n| 120713 | Tuol Sangkae I | Phsar Touch, Tuol Sangkae, Tuol Kork, Chong Khsach, Bak Touk, Tuol Sampov |\n| 120714 | Tuol Sangkae II | Kongkea Phos, Kos Andaet, Pong Peav, Boeung Rang, Tuol Porpae, Tuol Thgan |\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"General Population Census of the Kingdom of Cambodia 2019 \u2013 Final Results\" (PDF).*National Institute of Statistics*.

Cessac**\n\nCentre d'Etudes et de Recherches de Toulouse, 2 avenue Edouard Belin, BP 4025, 31055 Toulouse Cedex, France\n\n(Received 1 September 1994, revised 18 November 1994, accepted 1 December 1994)\n\n** Abstract **\n\nWe study the dynamics of a discrete time, continuous state neural network with random asymmetric\ncouplings and random thresholds. The evolution of the neurons is given in the thermodynamic limit by\na set of dynamic mean-field equations obtained by using a local chaos hypothesis. We study the\nevolution of the mean quadratic distance between two trajectories, and show there exist two\ndifferent regimes according to the value of the control parameters. In the first one (static regime)\ntwo initially close trajectories evolve to the same fixed point, while, in the second one, (chaotic\nregime) they diverge with an exponential rate, and evolve to a constant, non zero distance. The\ncritical condition for the transition is obtained in a general frame, but, in a specific case, we\nrecover the\nequation for the De Almeida-Thouless line suggesting strong analogy with the SK model. Besides, the\nlimit for the quadratic distance is the same for all initial conditions choice, showing that\nultrametricity occurs in our model. However, we show numerically that this property is not associated\nto a complex breaking up of the phase space like in the SK model. Besides, the quenched stochastic\nprocess giving the evolution of the neurons is a white noise in the thermodynamic limit. The\nbehaviour of our model when crossing the AT line can be characterized by studying the\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy, which exhibits a sharp transition in the thermodynamic limit. This entropy\nis zero in the static phase, while it becomes infinite in the chaotic regime.\n\n** R\u00e9sum\u00e9 **\n\nNous \u00e9tudions la dynamique d'un r\u00e9seau de neurones \u00e0 temps discret, dont les couplages sont\nasym\u00e9triques, al\u00e9atoires, et les seuils al\u00e9atoires. L'\u00e9volution des neurones est donn\u00e9e\n\u00e0 la limite thermodynamique par un jeu d'\u00e9quations de champ moyen dynamique obtenues via une\nhypoth\u00e8se de chaos local. Nous \u00e9tudions l'\u00e9volution de la distance quadratique moyenne entre\ndeux trajectoires, et montrons qu'il existe deux r\u00e9gimes selon la valeur des param\u00e8tres de\ncontr\u00f4le. Dans le premier (r\u00e9gime statique) deux conditions initiales arbitrairement proches\nconvergent vers le m\u00eame point fixe, alors que, dans le second (r\u00e9gime chaotique), elles\ndivergent avec une vitesse exponentielle et \u00e9voluent vers une distance constante non nulle. La\ncondition critique de transition est obtenue dans un cadre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais pour un cas\nparticulier nous retrouvons l'\u00e9quation de la ligne AT sugg\u00e9rant une forte analogie avec le\nmod\u00e8le SK. De plus, la distance quadratique limite en r\u00e9gime chaotique est la m\u00eame, qu'elles\nque soient les conditions initiales, montrant que notre mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9sente une structure\nultram\u00e9trique. Nous montrons num\u00e9riquement que cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n'est cependant pas\nassoci\u00e9e \u00e0 un\nmorc\u00e8lement complexe de l'espace des phases comme pour le mod\u00e8le SK. En outre, nous montrons que\nle processus d'\u00e9volution des neurones est, \u00e0 la limite thermodynamique, un bruit blanc. Le\ncomportement de notre mod\u00e8le \u00e0 la travers\u00e9e de la ligne AT peut \u00eatre illustr\u00e9 en\n\u00e9tudiant l'entropie de Kolmogorov-Sina\u00ef qui pr\u00e9sente une transition brutale \u00e0 la limite\nthermodynamique.

Using mean-field equations, the bifurcations of the fixed points and the change of regime when varying control parameters are established. Different areas with various regimes are defined in the parameter space. Chaos arises generically by a quasi-periodicity route.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nAmari, S. (1972).

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

The HBT improves on the BJT in that it can handle signals of very high frequencies, up to several hundred GHz.\nQ: What is the difference between HBT and HEMT?\nA: HBTs differ from High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) in material composition, operating principles, and performance characteristics. HBTs, being bipolar devices, generally have higher operating voltages and noise compared to unipolar HEMTs.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_72ac2f66278b4d48ae8a51b2\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Alexandre\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Dubonchevallier\\\\\\\" 1987 \\\\\\\"superlattice\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"epitaxial\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Double-interdigitated (TIL) bipolar transistor with heavily doped ...\nURL: https:\/\/eurekamag.com\/research\/074\/950\/074950650.php?srsltid=AfmBOop7YSi8gF-gQp-16rWIQxijCSCcuqtMyPea0pYU1FsNjOoDGZy6\n... superlattice base ...

This particular study diverged from isolating natural variants; instead, it detailed the *chemical alteration* of surfactin through the targeted addition of simple alkyl ester moieties. The investigation characterized the resulting products, assessed how these modifications impacted surface activity and cell-lysing potential, and explored the altered affinity for certain divalent cations.

As the name implies, surfactants stir up activity on the surface you are cleaning to help trap dirt and remove it from the surface. Surfactants have a hydrophobic (water-hating) tail and a hydrophilic (water-loving) head.\nQ: What does surfactant do to surface area?\nA: Surfactants are surface-active substances, i.e., substances that reduce the surface tension of a liquid (usually water) and the interfacial tension with other liquids and solids. They therefore have a major influence on all types of interfacial contact and affect phenomena such as wetting, miscibility, and foaming.\nQ: What is the primary function of surfactants in personal care products?\nA: They allow water and oil to effectively mix, facilitating the removal of dirt, makeup, and sebum from the skin and hair. Surfactants are not only key ingredients for their cleansing function in some cosmetics, but they are also necessary for obtaining any product that combines fatty and aqueous ingredients.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_1689f00e327247419d536fa4\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Thimon surfactin 1994 alkyl ester modification\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Structural Diversity of the Microbial Surfactin Derivatives from ...\nURL: https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC4307338\/\nThis article presents the chemical modification of surfactin esterified with three different alcohols, and nine novel surfactin derivatives have been separated ...\n\n---\n\nResult 1: The Surfactin-Like Lipopeptides From Bacillus spp. - Frontiers\nURL: https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/journals\/bioengineering-and-biotechnology\/articles\/10.3389\/fbioe.2021.623701\/full\nSurfactin is a lipoheptapeptide produced by several Bacillus species and identified for the first time in 1969.\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Top 12 papers published in the topic of Surfactin in 1994 - SciSpace\nURL: https:\/\/scispace.com\/topics\/surfactin-q3sb356e\/1994\nTL;DR: In this article, the esterification of surfactin by methalonic HCl gave a mixture of two monoesters and a diester, and two association constants with Ca ...\n\n---\n\nResult 3: (PDF) Structural Diversity of the Microbial Surfactin Derivatives from ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/271140422_Structural_Diversity_of_the_Microbial_Surfactin_Derivatives_from_Selective_Esterification_Approach\nThis study shows that esterification is one of the most efficient ways of chemical modification for surfactin and it can be used to prepare more ...\n\n---\n\nResult 4: [PDF] Structural Diversity of the Microbial Surfactin Derivatives from ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/Structural-Diversity-of-the-Microbial-Surfactin-Shao-Liu\/c79a00a630534e2a1bdf2dc235d5a3a9ee3dc82a\nThis study shows that esterification is one of the most efficient ways of chemical modification for surfactin and it can be used to prepare more derivatives ...\n\n---\n\nResult 5: [Ala4]Surfactin, a Novel Isoform from <i>Bacillus subtilis<\/i> Studied ...\nURL: https:\/\/febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1111\/j.1432-1033.1994.tb19998.x\nThe alanine N-heptafluorobutyryl n-butyl ester was analyzed by gas chromatography on a Chirasil Val I11 capillary column (25 m X 0.32 mm) with helium as carrier.\n\n---\n\nResult 6: [PDF] Surfactin \u2013 Novel Solutions for Global Issues - IntechOpen\nURL: https:\/\/cdn.intechopen.com\/pdfs\/12830\/InTech-Surfactin_novel_solutions_for_global_issues.pdf\nBesides its antifungal and antibacterial effects (Thimon et al., 1992), surfactin can also inhibit fibrin clot formation www.intechopen.com ...\n\n---\n\nResult 7: Detergent-Like Action of the Antibiotic Peptide Surfactin on Lipid ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.cell.com\/fulltext\/S0006-3495(01)75808-0\nSurfactin is a bacterial lipopeptide with powerful surfactant-like properties.

This article presents the chemical modification of surfactin esterified with three different alcohols, and nine novel surfactin derivatives have been separated from products by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The novel derivatives, identified with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), are the mono-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester, mono-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester, mono-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C14 ester, *di*-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester, *di*-hexyl-surfactin ester C15, *di*-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin ester C14, *di*-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin ester C15, *di*-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester and, *di*-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester. The reaction conditions for esterification were optimized and the dependence of yields on different alcohols and catalysts were discussed. This study shows that esterification is one of the most efficient ways of chemical modification for surfactin and it can be used to prepare more derivatives to meet the needs of study in biological and interfacial activities.\n\n**Keywords:** Keywords: surfactin, esterification, derivatives, lipopeptide, carboxyl group\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nSurfactin produced by strains of *Bacillus subtilis* is one of the most popular lipopeptide and has been studied for tens of years. It is a potent clotting inhibitor and can reduce the surface tension of water to 27 from 72 mN\/m [1]. Surfactin is one of the cyclic lipopeptides lactonized by a heptapeptide and a \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acid. The typical heptapeptide is l-Glu-l-Leu-d-Leu-l-Val-l-Asp-d-Leu-l-Leu [2,3,4], although there exist some homologues differentiated in their peptide sequence, such as [Val7] surfactin, [Ile7] surfactin [5], [Ala4] surfactin [6], [Asp1, Glu5] surfactin [7]. The \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acids are *n*-, *iso*-, or *anteiso*-3-hydroxy fatty with 12\u201316 carbons [7,8,9]. The representative structure of surfactin is shown in Figure 1.\n\nMuch interest has been focused on the chemical modification of surfactin. At present, most reported modifications were concentrated on opening the lactone ring through hydrolysis, and on methylation of the peptide loop side chain. It was reported that the lactone ring could be opened by treatment with alkaline [10,11], the resulted linear surfactin lost 97% of the protoplast-bursting activity [10], had no significant hemolysis and the surface activity of it was reduced compared to the cyclic ones [12]. Considering about methylation, there are two possible approaches to get the methyl surfactin, chemical modification [2,4,13,14,15,16,17] and biosynthesis [18,19,20]. Because of the two carboxylic groups on side chains of the lactone ring, there would be different esterified derivatives. Surfactin-Glu-\u03b3-methyl ester had a higher surfactant power than that of the surfactin, and a much higher haemolytic activity, 12 \u03bcM instead of 200 \u03bcM for 100% haemolysis [14], but lower anti-tumoral effect [18]. When residues of both an aspartic acid and a glutamic acid in surfactin were methylated (dimethyl-surfactin), the oil displacement activity increased by 20% and the derivatives showed an increased acid tolerance [16], but showed no virus-inactivation capacity [21]. The amidated surfactin had very similar properties of dimethyl-surfactin [16]. There were also some articles about total chemical synthesis, either in the liquid phase [22] or solid phase system [12,23,24,25] to get cyclic or linear surfactin and their analogues with low yields.\n\nIt could be inferred from the previous study that the increase of the hydrophobic of the polar domain could improve the surface activity of surfactin, but hydrolysis of the lactone ring would decrease the surface activity. Esterification is one of the most efficient ways of chemical modification [26]. In this article, we studied on producing variety of esterified surfactin derivatives in different reaction systems. The new compounds would provide some novel ideas to carry out study on the structure and property relationship of surfactin.\n\n## 2. Results and Discussion\n\n### 2.1. Identification of Surfactin-(Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-Hexyl Ester\n\nThe product formed by the reaction of surfactin with *n*-hexyl alcohol was purified by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) and identified by FT-IR (Fourier Transform InfraRed Spectroscopy) and ESI-MS (Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry). Four fractions B1, B2, B3 and B4 were separated, as shown in Figure 2. The yields of B1, B2, B3 and B4 were 3.4%, 5.4%, 32.4% and 48.2%, respectively.\n\nFT-IR spectroscopy of B1\u2013B4 was described in Figure 3. The FT-IR spectroscopy for purified compounds showed strong absorbance from 3500 to 3200 cm\u22121 with the maximum at 3303, 3304, 3305 and 3309 cm\u22121 for B1, B2, B3 and B4, respectively, which implies a typical feature stretching of N\u2013H in the peptide. The maximum absorbance around 1650 cm\u22121 belonged to C=O stretching vibration of the amide I region. The interaction of C\u2013N stretching mode of C\u2013N\u2013H group and N\u2013H bending vibration contributed to the absorbance around 1550 cm\u22121. The absorbance between 3000 and 2800 cm\u22121 was the evidence of aliphatic chain. The absorbance among 1800\u20131700 cm\u22121 was due to the C=O stretching mode of the lactone ring. Therefore, all these four fractions, B1, B2, B3 and B4 had the structure character of lipopeptide. C\u2013O\u2013C stretching mode located around 1190 and 1080 cm\u22121 region. Compared with that of the original surfactin-C14 and surfactin-C15, the absorbance intensity of B1\/B2 and B3\/B4 rose significantly in these two regions, which indicated the new ester bonds were introduced after this modification process. O\u2013H stretching had a broad absorbance from 3700\u20132200 cm\u22121, and the new compounds had narrow absorbance in this area revealed the reduction of carboxylic acid group. The FT-IR spectroscopy indicated that B1, B2, B3 and B4 were esterified surfactin.\n\nThe ESI-MS spectra of B1, B2, B3 and B4 showed the ionized molecular *m*\/*z* in Figure 4. For B1, the major *m*\/*z* peak was 1107, while *m*\/*z* peak at 1129 could also be found in the same mass spectrum. The difference between the two values was 22. Considering the common positive ionization mode: [M + H]+, [M + Na]+ and [M + K]+, the modes for B1 were [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+. The molecular weight of B1 was 1106, which was equaled to molecular weight calculation value of [Msurfactin-C14 + M n-hexylalcohol \u2212\n]. Combined with FT-IR results, B1 was mono-hexyl-surfactin-C14, which derived from surfactin-C14 with one of the carboxylic acid groups esterified by\n\n*n*-hexyl alcohol. The molecular weight of B2 was determined by the same way. B3 had the molecular weight of 1190, which equaled to the molecular weight calculation value of [M\n\nsurfactin-C14+ 2 \u00d7 M\n\n\u2212 2 \u00d7 ]. The molecular weight of B4 was equaled to molecular weight calculation value of [M\n\n*n*-hexylalcoholsurfactin-C15+ 2 \u00d7 M\n\n\u2212 2 \u00d7 ].\n\n*n*-hexylalcoholThe component identification results were listed in Table 1. B1 and B2 were mono-hexyl-surfactin ester, while B3 and B4 were *di*-hexyl-surfactin ester. The structures of B1, B2, B3 and B4 were described in Figure 5.\n\n#### Table 1.\n\n| Fraction |\nm\/z\n|\nIonization Mode | Molecular Weight | Compound |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| B1 | 1107 | [M + H]+\n|\n1106 | mono-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| 1129 | [M + Na]+\n|\n|||\n| B2 | 1121 | [M + H]+\n|\n1120 | mono-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester |\n| 1143 | [M + Na]+\n|\n|||\n| B3 | 1191 | [M + H]+\n|\n1190 |\ndi-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| 1213 | [M + Na]+\n|\n|||\n| B4 | 1205 | [M + H]+\n|\n1204 |\ndi-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester |\n| 1227 | [M + Na]+\n|\n\n### 2.2. Identification of (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-2-Methoxy-Ethyl-Surfactin Ester\n\nAnalytical and preparative HPLC were used to analyze and separate the product from the esterification and surfactin with 2-methoxyethanol. Three fractions, E1, E2 and E3, were purified from the product, as shown in Figure 6. The yields of E1, E2 and E3 were 1.3%, 11.0% and 16.9%, respectively.\n\nFT-IR contradiction between original surfactin and reaction products was described in Figure 7. E1, E2 and E3 showed a significant characteristic transmittance of lipopeptide at the certain wave number. For E1, E2 and E3, there was no strong absorbance around 2610 cm\u22121, which might relate to carboxylic acid dimmer of Glu and Asp. The absorbance in 1032 cm\u22121 implied the new ester bond was introduced, which implied that E1, E2 and E3 were surfactin esters.\n\nE1, E2 and E3 had quasi-molecular ion peak, *m*\/*z* at 1102.7, 1160.7 and 1174.7, respectively (Figure 8). The usual ionized mode in ESI-MS were [M + H]+, [M + Na]+ and [M + K]+. When the mode was assumed as [M + Na]+, the molecular weight of E1 was 1079.7, which equaled to the molecular weight calculation value of [Msurfactin-C14 + M2-methoxyethanol \u2212\n]. E1 was the surfactin C14 ester with one of the carboxylic acid groups esterified by 2-methoxyethanol, which could be named as mono-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C14 ester. The same analysis method was used to obtain the molecular weight of E2 and E3 (Table 2). Their structures were elaborated in Figure 9.\n\n#### Table 2.\n\n| Fraction |\nm\/z\n|\nIonization Mode | Molecular Weight | Compound |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| E1 | 1102 | [M + Na]+\n|\n1079 | mono-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| E2 | 1160 | [M + Na]+\n|\n1137 |\ndi-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| E3 | 1174 | [M + Na]+\n|\n1151 |\ndi-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C15 ester |\n\n### 2.3. Identification of Surfactin-(Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-6-Hydoxyl-Hexyl Ester\n\nThe product obtained from reaction between surfactin and 1,6-hexanediol contained two major components, D1 and D2 (Figure 10). They were purified by semi-preparative HPLC under the above-mentioned condition. The yields of D1 and D2 were 33.8% and 53.1%, respectively.\n\nFT-IR spectroscopy of D1 and D2 were described in Figure 11. The FT-IR spectroscopy for purified compounds showed the maximum absorbance at 1654 and 1652 cm\u22121 belonging to C=O stretching vibration of the amide I region. And there was strong absorbance from 3500 to 3200 cm\u22121 with the maximum at 3309 and 3311 cm\u22121 for D1 and D2, respectively, which was a typical feature stretching of N\u2013H in the peptide. The absorbance at 1537 and 1538 cm\u22121 was due to the interaction of C\u2013N stretching mode of C\u2013N\u2013H group and N\u2013H bending vibration. The absorbance between 3000 and 2800 cm\u22121 was the evidence of aliphatic chain. The absorbance around 1730 cm\u22121 was due to the C=O stretching mode of the lactone ring. Therefore, it could be confirmed that D1 and D2 had the structure character of lipopeptide. Compared with that of the original surfactin-C14 and surfactin-C15, the absorbance intensity rose significantly at 1054 cm\u22121 for D1 and at 1058 cm\u22121 for D2. Those two regions related to C\u2013O\u2013C stretching mode, which proved new ester bonds were introduced. From 3700 to 2200 cm\u22121, the broad absorbance of O\u2013H stretching still remained for D1 and D2, but more narrow compared with that of original surfactin. The new absorbance of 987 cm\u22121 represents the interaction between (O\u2013H) bending vibration and (C=O) stretching. So hydroxyl group existed in both D1 and D2. It could be indicated that D1 and D2 were esterified surfactin with hydroxyl group.\n\nESI-MS of D1 and D2 was shown in Figure 12. The molecular weight of D1 was revealed to be 1222, for [M + H]+ ion at *m*\/*z* 1223 and [M + Na]+ ion at *m*\/*z* 1245 accordingly, which equaled to molecular weight calculation value of [Msurfactin-C14 + 2 \u00d7 M1,6-hexanediol \u2013 2 \u00d7\n]. D1 was *di*-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin ester C14. Component identification results were listed in Table 3. Both D1 and D2 were *di*-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin ester, which structures were described in Figure 13.\n\n#### Table 3.\n\n| Fraction | m\/z |\nIonization Mode | Molecular Weight | Compound |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| D1 | 1223 | [M + H]+\n|\n1222 |\ndi-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| 1245 | [M + Na]+\n|\n|||\n| D2 | 1237 | [M + H]+\n|\n1236 |\ndi-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester |\n| 1259 | [M + Na]+\n|\n\n### 2.4. Discussion\n\nThe typical surfactins are the two homological compounds, C14 and C15, and the difference between them is the length of the hydrophobic chain. New compounds B1, B3 and D1 were derived from surfactin-C14, while B2, B4 and D2 from surfactin-C15. HPLC chromatogram pattern had highly similarity between the original surfactins and the esterified ones. In the original surfactin, component ratio of C14 and C15 was approximately 1:1.57, while the yield one of (B1 + B3): (B2 + B4) equaled to 1: 1.50, E2:E3 equaled to 1:1.54 and D1:D2 equaled to 1:1.57. It implies that the individual derivative yields of C14 and C15 were directly related to the ratio of each component in the original surfactin.\n\nSince there are two carboxyl groups in the peptide moiety of surfactin, their chemically modified products exhibit two classes of forms. One is either Asp-\u03b2- or Glu-\u03b3-carboxyl group esterified by alcohol (monoester-SF), B1, B3 and E1, while the other is both of the two carboxyl groups esterified (diester-SF), B2, B4, E2, E3, D1 and D2. Owing to the composition of the surfactin and esterification mode, modified compounds were diverse in form. The structural diversity of the surfactin derivatives indicates their difference in properties.\n\nWe had tried to use concentrated HCl to catalyze the reaction of surfactin with 2-methyethanol and 1,6-hexanediol, but the results were not satisfied as there was almost 60% original surfactin still remained in the reaction solvent after stirred for over 4 days. It is probably because of the existence of two hydroxyl groups or polyoxyethylene group in the same molecule reduced the individual hydroxyl group electron density, and therefore decreased the reactivity of 2-methyethanol and 1,6-hexanediol. DCC\/DMAP [27] and EDC\/DMAP [28] were common catalysts for esterification, but based on current references, these two catalysts had not been applied to surfactin esterification. It was found that the product from DCC\/DMAP catalysis contained some byproducts, which is because of the 1,3-rearrangement of intermediate *O*-acylisoura leading to the forming of *N*-acylura that could not react with alcohol. The yield of byproducts was above 30%. While after reacted in the EDC\/DMAP system for 24 h, surfactin was completely transferred into ester. Based on current work, the merit of EDC\/DMAP catalyzing esterification method was fast and complete.\n\nFor HCl catalysis system, it was found that the ratios of monoester-SF and diester-SF in the products varied with the concentration of HCl and the reaction time. Three kinds of *n*-alcohol were selected to study the relationship between reaction condition and moiety type. Four conditions had been adopted to find regular pattern of the yield, condition 1 (C.1: catalyzed by 1 mol\/L HCl; reacted for 24 h), condition 2 (C.2: catalyzed by 1 mol\/L HCl; reacted for 48 h), condition 3 (C.3: catalyzed by concentrated HCl; reacted for 24 h) and condition 4 (C.4: catalyzed by concentrated HCl; reacted for 48 h). The ratios of monoester-SF and diester-SF in these four reaction conditions were plotted in Figure 14. The ratio for monoester-SF in the products was C.1 > C.2 > C.3 > C.4, while the ratio order was on the contrary for diester-SF. When the reaction was carried out in the 1 mol\/L HCl, it was more inclined to create monoester-SF. For diester-SF concentrated HCl was preferred. Prolonging reaction time from 24 to 48 h was advantageous for the production of diester-SF, but disadvantageous for monoester-SF, which was consistent with Thimon\u2019s report [14]. The results indicated that it was possible to regulate the ratio of surfactin monoester and diester, as well as to obtain specific derivative.\n\nCompared with the original surfactin, the retention time of those new compounds on the reverse phase column was elongated, which suggested the improvement of the hydrophobic property of them. Furthermore, in our experiment condition, B4 and D2 had nano pore phenomenon with the artificial bilayer membrane with only one side addition of them to the membrane, while original surfactin should be added on both sides to show such phenomenon [29]. This related to the importance of hydrophobic interaction in molecular penetration capability [11].\n\nThe calcium tolerance ability and the oil displacement activity [16] were improved through the modifications since Glu and Asp are negative charged amino acid residues in alkaline solutions and easily chelated with calcium [30].\n\n## 3. Experimental Section\n\n### 3.1. Reagents\n\nThe surfactin sample we used was obtained from the cell-free broth of *Bacillus subtilis* HSO 121 in our lab. The *n*-hexyl-alcohol, *n*-butyl-alcohol, *n*-amyl-alcohol, 2-methoxyethanol, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) were purchased from Aladdin-reagent Incorporation (Shanghai, China). The 1,6-hexanediol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\n### 3.2. Preparation of (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-Hexyl-Surfactin Ester\n\nFifty milligrams of surfactin was dissolved in 75 mL *n*-hexyl alcohol. Being added with 0.5 mL concentrated HCl, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 48 h and then successively washed by 0.5 mL redistilled water for three times to remove HCl, and dried with Na2SO4. After removing the residual alcohol under vacuum, the (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-hexyl-surfactin ester was prepared and applied to the analytical HPLC to monitor the components of the product. The purification was performed by RP-semi-preparative HPLC. The molecular weight and functional groups of product were detected by ESI-MS and FT-IR, respectively.\n\n### 3.3. Preparation of (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-2-Methoxy-Ethyl-Surfactin Ester\n\nOne hundred milligrams of surfactin was dissolved in 100 mL chloroform and added with 50 mg DCC\/5 mg DMAP and 3 mL 2-methoxyethanol in the ice-water bath. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then washed orderly by 100 mL fresh 1% citric acid solution, 100 mL 1% sodium bicarbonate solution, 100 mL redistilled water, 100 mL saturated salt water and 100 mL redistilled water, and retention organic phase was dried with Na2SO4. The organic solvent was filtered with 0.22 \u03bcm filter membrane before the chloroform removed under vacuum. After (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin ester was prepared, reverse phase HPLC was used to analyze the components of this product. Then the purification was achieved by RP-semi-preparative HPLC. The molecular weight and functional groups of product were separately detected by ESI-MS and FT-IR.\n\n### 3.4. Preparation of (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-6-Hydoxyl-Hexyl-Surfactin Ester\n\nOne gram of surfactin was dissolved in 100 mL chloroform and added with 0.45 g EDC\/0.29 g DMAP and 4.7 g 1,6-hexanediol in the ice-water bath, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then washed orderly by 100 mL fresh 1% citric acid solution, 100 mL 1% sodium bicarbonate solution, 100 mL redistilled water, 100 mL saturated salt solution and 100 mL redistilled water, and retained organic phase was dried with Na2SO4. After removing the chloroform under vacuum, (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin ester was prepared. Analytical HPLC was used to monitor the components of this product. And the purification was achieved by semi-preparative HPLC. ESI-MS and FT-IR could be used for the product molecular weight and functional group detection.\n\n### 3.5. Analysis and Purification\n\nAnalytical HPLC was performed to determine the number of fractions on HPLC system (PU2080 Solvent Delivery System, CO-2060 Column Thermostat, 20 \u00b5L Quantitative Loop\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_cfdc600daf834dbd8be1d559\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Selective esterification of surfactin: Preparation and properties of surfactin methyl esters\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Biotechnol.

This particular unit is recognized for its historical sultanates and a prominent historical figure who, following a period of banishment, established his own coastal dominion. The principal urban center of this newly formed dominion, an ancient port, is noted to have developed as an outpost concurrently with a neighboring settlement, both under the authority of an earlier, formidable medieval empire. This neighboring settlement, also originating in that historical period, was another territory controlled by this extensive empire, which was distinguished by its management of vital watercourses and its far-reaching trade networks before its power waned, enabling one of its own military commanders to rise to prominence. This commander, having previously served the declining empire, successfully broke away to institute his own dynastic sovereignty. The resultant state governed by this commander's lineage held sway over several areas, including a notable town celebrated for an annual traditional combat festival.

These cells have a myofibroblastic phenotype with the ability to proliferate and synthesize large quantities of extracellular matrix components. A number of factors have been proposed to initiate and perpetuate the fibrogenic process in stellate cells, including inflammatory cytokines, alterations in the extracellular matrix, growth factors, and oxidative stress. Some recent research has focused on the intracellular signaling pathways that are stimulated by these factors in stellate cells, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, focal adhesion kinase, and protein kinase C. This paper will summarize the experimental evidence that implicates these pathways in stellate cell activation, focusing on the effects of exposure to platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and fibronectin. Implications for alcohol-induced hepatic fibrosis and future directions for research will also be discussed.\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## Substances\n\n## Grants and funding\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Full Text Sources\n\n### Other Literature Sources\n\n### Miscellaneous","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_07f94fba53a5410eb413f4b1\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Intracellular signaling pathways in stellate cell activation\\\\\\\" Britton Bacon title\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":5}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Retinoic acid suppresses the response to platelet-derived growth ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/Retinoic-acid-suppresses-the-response-to-growth-in-Davis-Coll\/66ed9a4286818b998373f7ec17d00f8e8307b9f9\nIntracellular signaling pathways in stellate cell activation.

However, in patients older than 4 years, hypokalemia is the most common SEA.\nQ: What is the clinical practice guideline for maintenance intravenous fluids in children?\nA: 1A: The AAP recommends that patients 28 days to 18 years of age requiring maintenance IVFs should receive isotonic solutions with appropriate potassium chloride (KCl) and dextrose because they significantly decrease the risk of developing hyponatremia (evidence quality: A; recommendation strength: strong; Table 2 ).\nQ: When is Holliday-Segar not appropriate?\nA: The Holliday\u2013Segar method may not be appropriate in children with urine outputs that are abnormally high (e.g., due to adrenal failure or diuretic exposure) or low (e.g., due to hypovolemia, SIADH secretion, renal failure, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or cirrhosis).","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_10b5c265d4724db5851d9f49\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"2005\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"potassium chloride\\\\\\\" guidelines \\\\\\\"pediatric\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"British Medical Journal\\\\\\\" Alberta Canada\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"2005\" \"potassium chloride\" guidelines \"pediatric\" \"British Medical Journal\" Alberta Canada","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_5a3b04d559ce4774a37a1c67\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"2005\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"intravenous fluids\\\\\\\" guidelines pediatric \\\\\\\"British Medical Journal\\\\\\\" Canada\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Intravenous Fluid Therapy - Adults Guideline Consultation ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.nice.org.uk\/guidance\/cg174\/documents\/intravenous-fluids-therapy-guideline-consultation-comments-table-with-responses2\nAnesth Analg 2005;101(3):629-34.

Outside the body, the osmolarity of the solution is 269 mOsmol\/L (sodium and dextrose combined).\nQ: How many mmol L of sodium are in normal saline?\nA: Osmolarity: 308 mOsm\/L. Sodium chloride 0.9% solution is isotonic and contains 0.154 mmol\/mL of sodium. When infused at a rate of 1 mL\/hour, this will provide 3.7 mmol of sodium per day.\nQ: What is the IV fluid of choice for children?\nA: The fluid of choice in children is Ringer lactate-Glucose 5% (RL-G5%). Use a premixed solution if available. If not, add 50 ml of G50% to 500 ml of RL or 100 ml of G50% to 1000 ml of RL.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived. If a term for 'spoken unit of language' in a major continental European tongue (akin to the 'wort' in the Scandinavian bread's name), combined with an adjective signifying 'unfettered', forms the masthead of a prominent regional news publication, how many local bureaus does this publication maintain?"},"answer":"7","judge_reward_func":0.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0849186138,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":32.0,"prompt_tokens":459807.0,"completion_tokens":2335.0,"total_tool_calls":32.0}

Focal stroke lesions affecting either cortical and sub-cortical neurons or descending fiber tracts may affect the neural processing in the motor network (Ward and Cohen, 2004; Stinear et al., 2007). This leads to motor deficit, mainly caused by hemiparesis, that is one of the most common stroke-related disabilities (Katan and Luft, 2018). Nevertheless, it has been observed that patients with initially mild to moderate motor impairments may show substantial recovery of the motor function within the first 3 months after stroke onset. This may be driven by neural plasticity and reorganization, which can occur in the brain also far from the lesion site (Nudo, 2006; Cramer, 2008; Rehme and Grefkes, 2013).\n\nTo investigate cortical functional reorganization, connectivity models based on the concept that the brain is organized in specialized anatomically distinct areas functionally integrated in networks (Friston, 2002) were applied to neuroimaging techniques, both in experimental and computational simulation studies (Falcon et al., 2016; Allegra Mascaro et al., 2020). Functional connectivity is usually inferred by means of correlations among measurements of neuronal activity neglecting information on the coupling direction, whereas the directed functional connectivity investigates the causal influence that a brain region exerts over another (Friston, 2011; Barrett and Barnett, 2013). In the literature, the analysis of cortical directed and undirected functional connectivity has been extensively used to characterize the brain connections and investigate rehabilitation effects on patients after stroke events (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Connectivity studies can be carried out during both task and resting state conditions, the latter being the easiest protocol executable also for patients in the acute stage. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that changes in resting state connectivity, especially in the motor network, are predictive of motor function recovery in stroke patients (James et al., 2009; Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Volz et al., 2016; Hordacre et al., 2020).\n\nAmong neuroimaging techniques, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was one of the first employed to investigate brain connectivity. Given its high spatial resolution and the provided volumetric information, fMRI allows investigation of connections involving both cortical and deep structures in the brain (Farr and Wegener, 2010). Electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed as a valid alternative technique, as it allowed to reconstruct known resting state networks from signals acquired by scalp electrodes in healthy subjects (Mantini et al., 2007). Despite its lower spatial resolution, EEG offers a higher time resolution with respect to fMRI, allowing to better track the fast reconfiguration of neuronal networks and to extract information on the spectral characteristics of the functional networks related to specific brain rhythms. Moreover, it exploits cheaper and portable instrumentation, allowing measurements both on healthy and pathological subjects, also accessible in complex medical setting (Borich et al., 2015).\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, a plethora of measures and indexes have been proposed to infer both functional and causal connectivity from EEG recordings (Pereda et al., 2005), including bivariate and conditional Granger causality (GC), transfer entropy (TE), directed transfer function (DTF), directed coherence (DC), partial directed coherence (PDC) and dynamical Bayesian inference. Each of these metrics may be sensitive to different aspects of the neurophysiological data, evidenced either in time or frequency domains or through linear or non-linear relationships. Therefore, the choice of a metric over another depends on the particular aspect of interest in the connectivity network; moreover, the reliability of a specific metric can depend on different factors related to the specific application, such as the stationarity of the signal, non-linear effects or indirect connections among networks nodes. Different causal connectivity metrics can lead to different results and careful interpretation is required. Usually, only one metric is chosen to retrieve networks\u2019 topology and infer the spectral content of the information flow between network nodes. However, the use of a single metric cannot guarantee a comprehensive description of the network (Blinowska, 2011). For instance, GC and TE provide compact information on the overall information flow between network nodes, while DTF, DC and PDC focus on specific rhythms of physiological interest (Sameshima and Baccal\u00e1, 2014; Seth et al., 2015); bivariate GC\/TE and DC detect the overall flow of information from one node to another, while conditional GC\/TE and DTF\/PDC elicit direct connections but may lose ability to capture the coupling strength (Faes et al., 2012). Finally, the dynamical Bayesian inference approach has been proposed to assess the cross-frequency coupling strength both in neural networks and among different physiological systems, e.g., cardio-respiratory-cortical interactions (Stankovski et al., 2016). Until now, an agreed standard measure to assess EEG-based causal connectivity is not univocally employed in the literature, and the selection of the most appropriate measure still represents an open issue.\n\nMoreover, in the context of EEG analysis, causal connectivity was often identified directly from the electrodes signal, but it has been demonstrated that connectivity computed in the electrode space is affected by the scalp volume-conduction effect and the obtained results can be hardly interpreted as real brain connectivity (Hassan and Wendling, 2018; Marinazzo et al., 2019; Van de Steen et al., 2019). On the contrary, meaningful connectivity patterns can be derived from cortical source activities extracted from EEG inverse solutions (Michel and Murray, 2012; Haufe et al., 2013).\n\nAlthough the effects of stroke on resting-state brain connectivity have been widely investigated, especially in the acute phase with respect to healthy subjects, a limited number of works focused specifically on longitudinal effects of motor rehabilitation on the reorganization of the cortical motor network after stroke. Moreover, the majority of studies exploited fMRI to assess functional, non-directed connectivity (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Considering EEG analysis, up to now, the majority of studies explored functional connectivity in post-stroke populations in both acute (Caliandro et al., 2017; Vecchio et al., 2019a, 2019b; Fanciullacci et al., 2021; Hoshino et al., 2021) and chronic stages (Gerloff et al., 2006; De Vico Fallani et al., 2009, 2017; Wu et al., 2015; Hordacre et al., 2020; Molteni et al., 2020; Waterstone et al., 2020; Romeo et al., 2021); only fewer studies investigated the resting-state causal connectivity after stroke (Guo et al., 2014; Pichiorri et al., 2015, 2018; Calabr\u00f2 et al., 2018; Nicolo et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021). The few studies cited above employing EEG rarely focused on the investigation of the motor network, preferring a large-scale connectivity analysis of the whole brain with synthetic descriptors. Even though this type of information can serve as a general indication on the state of brain\u2019s connections after stroke, information about power spectral strength or flow direction in the identified connections are often missing. This type of information can be obtained by separate connectivity metrics computed from electrodes or brain sources signals and whose underlying interpretation should be carefully considered to compare the results between different studies.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, the investigation of motor network directed functional connectivity by means of EEG in sub-acute stroke patients should be deepened from both methodological and application perspectives. To this aim, in this work we perform an EEG-based longitudinal study of resting-state causal connectivity in a population of sub-acute stroke patients with motor impairment who underwent a rehabilitation treatment. We focus on the characterization of the motor network exploiting the cortical source signals reconstructed from EEG scalp recordings and using two different connectivity metrics, i.e., the Directed Coherence (DC) and the generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Combining the information carried by these two measures, we aim to provide a description of the variations induced by treatment in both the topography and the transfer of spectral power along the identified functional connections, investigating also possible correlations with the clinical assessment of motor recovery.\n\nIn Section 2, a detailed description of the participants enrolled for this study and the methodology followed is presented. In Section 3, the obtained results are reported and their discussion can be found in Section 4. Section 5 draws conclusions of the work.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1 Population Description\n\nEighteen subjects (age 67 \u00b1 10, seven females and 11 males) in the sub-acute stage after ischemic stroke were enrolled for this study. Inclusion criteria were age less than 80 years old, first unilateral stroke, distance from acute event less than 30 days, with no other concomitant orthopedic or rheumatologic disease, without global or comprehension aphasia, right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. Each subject was evaluated twice: firstly, at the admission to the rehabilitation center (T0, on average after 12 \u00b1 5 days from the stroke event) and secondly at the end of the rehabilitation treatment (T1, on average after 55 \u00b1 11 days from the event). In Table 1, details about participants\u2019 characteristics are reported. To participate, each subject signed a written informed consent. The study was reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee \u201cComitato Etico Provinciale dell\u2019Insubria\u201d and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nPatients followed a rehabilitation treatment for both upper and lower limb recovery: each patient underwent to a rehabilitation treatment twice per day, each session lasting 45 min. Training was tailored according to patients\u2019 residuals motor capacity and it included exercise for upper and lower limbs. Lower and upper limbs stretching, lower and upper limbs muscle strengthening, static and dynamic balance exercises, proprioception exercises, trunk control exercise, gait at the parallel bars or in clinical open spaces were the exercise performed.\n\n### 2.2 Functional Assessment\n\nClinical evaluations were performed by clinicians, i.e., physiotherapist and medical doctor. To assess the upper limb performance the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) (Fugl-Meyer et al., 1975) before and after treatment was used. The FMA motor score ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 66 (upper limb normal motor performance). As for the lower limb, the level of walking ability was assessed by the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC). This gait assessment scale distinguishes six levels of walking ability based on the amount of physical support required. The lowest level 0 indicates a patient who is not able to walk, while level 5, indicates a patient who can walk everywhere independently, including stairs (Holden et al., 1984). Participants\u2019 scores assigned at T0 and T1 for both clinical scales, i.e., FMAT0, FMAT1, FAC T0 and FAC T1, are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe variations \u0394FMA = FMAT1\u2013FMAT0 and \u0394FAC = FACT1\u2013FACT0 was considered as primary clinical outcomes of subject\u2019s motor recovery.\n\n### 2.3 EEG Data Acquisition\n\nResting state EEG recordings were performed with the Neuroscan system (Compumedics Neuroscan, Compumedics, NC, United States) using 64 Ag\/AgCl electrodes placed according to the International 10\/20 standard system. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz, with the reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz positions and the ground electrode positioned anterior to Fz. During the acquisition, patients were asked to keep their eyes closed in a sitting relaxed position for at least 5 min. As for functional assessment, EEG recordings were repeated twice, before (T0) and after (T1) the rehabilitation treatment.\n\n### 2.4 EEG Data Analysis\n\nIn Figure 1, a scheme of the principal steps followed for the analysis of single EEG recordings is reported. Three main stages can be identified: EEG signal pre-processing, current sources reconstruction and directed functional connectivity. In the scheme, inputs and outputs of each block are highlighted. Detailed explanation of each step is provided in the following sections.\n\n**FIGURE 1**. Pipeline of single acquisition and analysis. Abbreviations: MVAR, multivariate auto-regressive; DC, Directed Coherence; gPDC, generalized partial directed coherence.\n\n##### 2.4.1 EEG Pre-Processing\n\nEEG signals were pre-processed offline in Matlab environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) using the open source EEGLab signal processing Toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).\n\nData were down-sampled at 128 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 45 Hz to remove slow drifts and high-frequency components, such as the power line noise. Flat and \u201cbad\u201d channels were removed for further analysis. A flat channel was identified if it showed amplitude around zero (flatline) for more than 5 s consecutively, whereas a channel was identified as \u201cbad\u201d if it was noisy for more than 90% of the acquisition duration. An Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm (Mullen et al., 2015) was applied to all retained channels to identify and remove transient or high-amplitude artifacts, e.g., eye movements. According to Chang and others (Chang et al., 2020), the application of this cleaning approach improves the accuracy of subsequent Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The ASR algorithm automatically identifies clean periods of the EEG data using a sliding window. An artifact rejection threshold is calculated, based on the calibration signal distribution of variance and a user-defined cut-off parameter. Data portions, whose variance is larger than this threshold, are removed and reconstructed from neighboring channels using a covariance matrix computed from the calibration data. According to the cut-off parameter *k* chosen by the user, the method can be more or less aggressive in removing EEG components portions of data. In this work, *k* = 20 was employed, according to the range suggested by Chang and others, who validated the ASR method on real EEG data and found that a *k* in the range 10\u2013100 allows removing ocular artifacts still preserving cerebral components (Chang et al., 2020). Furthermore, ICA was applied to the ASR-cleaned EEG recordings exploiting the RUNICA Infomax algorithm as implemented in EEGLab (Makeig and Bell, 1996). RUNICA un-mixes the EEG recordings in cortical and non-cortical spatially distinct and temporally independent components (IC). Once the non-cortical components are identified and removed, the final cleaned EEG signal can be reconstructed. To guide the selection of ICs accounting for non-brain (artifactual) activities the ICLabel plugin was employed (Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019). It is an automated classifier which provides an estimation of the type of each of the IC (brain, eye, muscle, line noise, etc.) based on some component characteristics, i.e., power spectrum, its time-course, topography dipole localization and percentage data variance accounted in the considered component. A final visual check of the signals was performed. The originally removed \u201cbad\u201d channels were then reconstructed by the interpolation of the neighbor channels signals, thus obtaining a uniform EEG spatial sampling. Finally, EEG data were re-referenced to a common average reference and 1 min of cleaned, artifact-free 60 channels EEG was selected for all subjects.\n\n##### 2.4.2 Individual Alpha Frequency\n\nTo improve the accuracy of the EEG analysis in the frequency domain, the interindividual variability of the alpha rhythm peak was considered for the determination of the spectral bands of interest, as proposed by Klimesch in 1999 (Klimesch, 1999). In particular, for the purpose of this study, we focused our analysis on alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands, which are reported as the most involved in motor system functions (Pfurtscheller et al., 1994, 1996). After computing the power spectral density (PSD) for the parieto-occipital channels by the Welch method (Welch, 1967), the Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF) was determined as the average peak position in the spectral range 7.5\u201312.5 Hz. The average IAF found in our population was equal to 9.07 \u00b1 0.99 Hz. The IAF was used to define the alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands as follow: \u03b1 = [IAF-2 Hz \u00f7 IAF+2 Hz] and \u03b2 = [IAF+2.5 Hz \u00f7 IA\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_a3def1db9ad8493ab0bcf581\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"I Pirovano\\\\\\\" autonomic nervous system ECG neuroimaging diffusion magnetization transfer\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"I Pirovano\" autonomic nervous system ECG neuroimaging diffusion magnetization transfer","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_fea60ac9b6814f23ab50b498\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"I Pirovano\\\\\\\" CV biography autonomic neuroimaging\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] ABSTRACT BOOK fNIRS Italy 6-7 July 2023 - Unipd\nURL: https:\/\/lilia.dpss.psy.unipd.it\/fnirs-italy\/assets\/fNIRS23_abstractbook-Final.pdf\nClinical brain monitoring with time domain nirs: A review and future perspectives.

The now defunct MSE was the fourth stock exchange to be established in the country and the first in South India.[1] It had a turnover (2001) of \u20b9 3,090 crore ($440 million), but was a fraction (below 3.5 per cent) of the turnover generated by the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India. The turnover of the stock exchange was 19,907 Crore as of the financial year 2012.[2][3][4]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The Madras Stock Exchange Association (Private) Ltd. was registered on August 12, 1937. The first five founding member companies were Paterson & Co, Kothari & Co, Dalal & Co, Maconochie & Co and India Brokers\u2019.[5]\n\nThe Madras Stock Exchange Association (Private) Limited had been registered under the Indian Companies Act of 1913. After the coming into force of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, which enactment was passed to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business of dealing therein, by prohibiting auctions and for providing for certain other matters, the Company - Madras Stock Exchange Limited was incorporated on the 29th day of April, 1957.[6]\n\nWhen the Securities Contracts Regulation Act came into force in October 1957, the Madras Stock Exchange Association was converted into a company limited by guarantee under the Companies Act 1956. Membership of the Stock Exchange was also changed from firms to individuals, and the partners of the firms functioning at that time became individual members of the Stock Exchange.[7]\n\nIn 1996, the MSE was fully computerised and online trading became operational, as the MSE was connected to 120 broking offices in and around Chennai through wide area networking. On 14 May 2015, SEBI permitted Madras stock exchange to exit.[8] The Madras Stock Exchange ceased to exist on May 30, 2015.[9]\n\nAfter surrendering its license, MSE was rechristened Madras Enterprises Ltd and continues to trade as a sub broker to BSE and NSE.[10]\n\n## List of Former Presidents\n\n[edit]Madras Stock Exchange - Past Presidents[11]\n\n| Name | Company name | Year | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | C.

Krishnaswami & Co | 1950\u20131951 |\n\n## Functions\n\n[edit]The MSE had about 120 live members and 1,785 companies listed. The exchange followed the Rolling Settlement system, as per the January 2000 SEBI (Securities Exchange Board of India) guidelines and a proactive Grievance Cell is operational. By this system, investors could log in their complaints, for which a number was given for further reference, through which investors could keep track of the action taken by the exchange as regards their complaint.\n\nA subsidiary company - MSE Financial Services Ltd, had been established. A member of the Bombay Stock Exchange, MSE Financial Services did help to create greater broker and investor flexibility through multi-market access. The members were able to trade in both BSE and MSE. This was followed up with National Stock Exchange (NSE) membership.\n\nTrading on the exchange took place from 10.00 am to 3.30 pm.\n\n## Merging\n\n[edit]As per June 2012 notification from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), whereby individual stock exchanges should maintain a minimum liquid net worth of \u20b9 1,000 million and exchanges that do not comply with this requirement should close down their operations by June 2015, the Bangalore Stock Exchange (BgSE) decided to merge with the Madras Stock Exchange. The combined entity became the single largest regional exchange in the country with over 1,000 local companies listed exclusively on it. BgSE and MSE together had a liquid net worth of around \u20b9 500 million while another \u20b9 500 million will be raised by liquidating certain idle assets (situated in Bangalore and Chennai) of these exchanges.[12][13][14]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- List of stock exchanges in the Commonwealth of Nations\n- List of South Asian stock exchanges\n- Economy of Chennai\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**Madras Stock Exchange Ltd - About Us**^**\"Madras Stock Exchange plans to raise Rs 100 crore\"**^**\"Madras Stock Exchange to offer platform for MSMEs\"**^**\"Madras Stock Exchange plans to raise Rs 100 crore from PEs, IPO\"**^**\"75 years of stock broking\".**^**\"The Madras High Court - Court case\".**^**\"A BRIEF PROFILE OF MACONOCHIE & CO\".**^**Narasimhan, T E (17 May 2015). \"Sebi permits Madras Stock Exchange to exit business\".*Business Standard*.

Ottensmeyer?\nQ: Who owns the World Trade bridge?","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Let me carefully work through this complex riddle step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Water crossing in Pacific sovereign nation with metallic strands\n\nThe riddle begins with a vehicle transport crossing using \"guiding metallic strands\" in a Pacific sovereign nation. This describes a cable ferry system. The Pacific sovereign nation with such crossings would be somewhere like British Columbia (Canada) or similar Pacific regions.\n\n## Step 2: Hand-pulled example across North American international waterway\n\nThe riddle mentions a hand-pulled cable ferry across a major North American international waterway. From my search, this clearly refers to the **Los Ebanos Ferry** across the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo) between Los Ebanos, Texas and Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz, Tamaulipas, Mexico.\n\n## Step 3: US-side terminus - small community named after local flora, serves as port of entry\n\nLos Ebanos, Texas is named after the Texas Ebony (ebano) trees in the area and serves as an official port of entry. This matches perfectly.\n\n## Step 4: Connected to administrative area in neighboring southern country\n\nLos Ebanos connects to **Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz, Tamaulipas** - which is a municipality (administrative area) in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.\n\n## Step 5: Journeying west to another region bordering international waterway\n\nThe riddle asks for an administrative area situated to the west of Tamaulipas that also borders the international waterway (Rio Grande). Looking at Mexican geography, the state to the west of Tamaulipas that borders the Rio Grande would be **Nuevo Le\u00f3n**.\n\nHowever, I need to be more specific. The riddle mentions the principal settlement shares its designation and was a site of notable mid-19th-century military events. This suggests a specific municipality or city.\n\n## Step 6: Western region with principal settlement sharing designation, mid-19th century military events\n\nFrom my search about Ciudad Mier, I found that it had significant mid-19th century military events (the Mier Expedition of 1842). But Ciudad Mier is in Tamaulipas, not to the west.\n\nLet me reconsider. The riddle says \"journeying to an administrative area situated to the west of the previously mentioned southern one\" - so west of Tamaulipas. The state to the west is Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\n\nHowever, I need to find the specific place. Let me search more carefully for the connection to the United States.\n\n## Step 7: Connected to United States urban center by permanent engineered structure\n\nThis suggests a bridge. The most famous bridge connection between Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Texas would be between Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the geography. If we're looking for something west of Tamaulipas that also borders the Rio Grande and has connections to the US, it might be referring to the **Reynosa area** or another location.\n\nBut actually, let me step back and think about this systematically.\n\nThe riddle mentions:\n1. Starting with a cable ferry in Pacific nation\n2. Hand-pulled ferry across international waterway (Los Ebanos Ferry)\n3. US side: Los Ebanos (named after ebony trees, port of entry)\n4. Connected to Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz, Tamaulipas\n5. Journeying WEST to another region bordering the waterway\n6. This western region has principal settlement sharing name, site of mid-19th century military events\n7. Connected to US urban center by permanent structure\n\nThe key is finding what's west of Tamaulipas that also borders the Rio Grande and had mid-19th century military significance.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The riddle might be referring to the fact that if you go west from Tamaulipas along the Rio Grande, you could reach areas that connect to Texas cities.\n\nBut based on my searches, the most likely connection is the **Laredo-Nuevo Laredo area**, which is connected by the **Patrick J. Ottensmeyer International Railway Bridge**.\n\nFrom my searches, I found that the Ottensmeyer Bridge was completed\/inaugurated in **2025** (February 6, 2025 according to multiple sources).\n\nHowever, the riddle asks for the \"inaugural operational year\" - so this would be 2025.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this. The bridge was completed in December 2024 and officially opened\/inaugurated in February 2025. The \"inaugural operational year\" would typically refer to when it actually began operations, which would be 2025.\n\nLet me trace through the logic one more time:\n\n1. Pacific nation cable ferry \u2192 leads to concept of cable ferries globally\n2. Hand-pulled example \u2192 Los Ebanos Ferry across Rio Grande\n3. US side \u2192 Los Ebanos, Texas (named after ebony trees, port of entry)\n4. Connected to \u2192 Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz, Tamaulipas (municipality)\n5. Journeying WEST \u2192 this is where I need to be careful. If we're going west from Tamaulipas along the Rio Grande, we might not find another region with the characteristics described.\n6. However, if the riddle is referring to the general area and the connection to the US, then the most likely permanent structure connecting to a US urban center would be the Laredo-Nuevo Laredo bridge.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the geography. If we're going west from Tamaulipas (which is on the eastern side of Mexico relative to the Rio Grande), the western regions that border the Rio Grande would be in states like Chihuahua. But those don't have the characteristics described.\n\nI think there might be an error in my interpretation. Let me reconsider the path.\n\nActually, I think the riddle might be structured differently. Let me trace it again:\n\n1. Pacific nation cable ferry \u2192 establishes the concept\n2. Hand-pulled example \u2192 Los Ebanos Ferry\n3. US side \u2192 Los Ebanos, Texas (ebony tree name, port of entry)\n4. Connected to \u2192 Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz, Tamaulipas\n5. Journeying WEST \u2192 this could mean traveling westward within the region to find another area\n6. This western region borders the waterway and had mid-19th century military events\n7. Connected to US urban center by permanent structure\n\nGiven that the most prominent bridge connecting to a US urban center is the Laredo-Nuevo Laredo connection, and given that the Patrick J. Ottensmeyer bridge was completed in 2024\/2025, this seems to be the answer.\n\nHowever, I should note that my searches found the bridge was completed in December 2024 and inaugurated in February 2025. The \"inaugural operational year\" would be 2025.\n","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_2f6ed73e033e499e83d6e13a\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/www.cpkcr.com\/en\/media\/Laredo-bridge-completion-2024\\\", \\\"https:\/\/www.trains.com\/pro\/maintenance-of-way\/cpkc-ceremony-opens-ottensmeyer-bridge\/\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/www.cpkcr.com\/en\/media\/Laredo-bridge-completion-2024\n\n\n# Content from https:\/\/www.trains.com\/pro\/maintenance-of-way\/cpkc-ceremony-opens-ottensmeyer-bridge\/\nLAREDO, Texas \u2014 Canadian Pacific Kansas City today (Feb. 6, 2025) held the official opening ceremonies for the new Patrick J. Ottensmeyer International Railway Bridge, the second span crossing the Rio Grande at the busiest rail gateway between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe name Patrick J. Ottensmeyer will forever be a part of the proud history of Kansas City Southern and the legacy of CPKC,\u201d CPKC CEO Keith Creel said in a press release marking the ribbon-cutting event. \u201cPat believed strongly in the work our railroaders do every day enabling trade amongst great nations. His leadership and vision led to the development and completion of the second span of the international bridge between the United States and Mexico at North America\u2019s largest inland gateway. Having it bear his name is a fitting tribute to a remarkable leader and person.\u201d\n\nOttensmeyer, who served as Kansas City Southern\u2019s final CEO between 2015 and April 2023, died in July 2024 at age 67 [see \u201cFormer Kansas City Southern CEO Ottensmeyer dies,\u201d *Trains* News Wire, July 29, 2024].\n\nThe bridge was completed in December, allowing CPKC to eliminate the four-hour directional-running windows that created a border bottleneck [see \u201cCPKC completes second span \u2026,\u201d News Wire, Dec. 17, 2024]. The $100 million, 1,170-foot-long bridge, built 35 feet downstream from the cross-border bridge that opened in 1920, is a ballasted deck plate girder bridge with six reinforced concrete piers. Its enhanced border security features include a new X-ray railcar inspection system and surveillance cameras.\n\n\nWhat?, no 2816 at the ceremony. \ud83d\ude41\n\nWith the second bridge complete are they going to refurbish (repaint or upgrade) the original bridge.\n\nAre T&E crews still meeting locos at the center of the bridge?\n\nYes. Due to Union rules, Mexican crews are not allowed to operate on US soil.\n\nIf memory serves, allowance of Mexican crews to bring consists into the first yard available north of the border was raised, but resoundly dismissed. The union said it was simply being used as a wedge to get Mexican crews farther into the US.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Let me carefully work through this complex riddle step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Water crossing in Pacific sovereign nation with metallic strands\n\nThe riddle begins with a vehicle transport crossing using \"guiding metallic strands\" in a Pacific sovereign nation.

They developed military prowess after facing oppression from the Ethiopian Empire.\n\n2. **The chiefly group led by a son of a recognized sovereign**: This would be the Ethiopian Empire, and the key ruler here is Menelik II (son of King Sahle Maryam of Shewa). The Ethiopian royal dynasty traces its lineage to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, making them \"recognized sovereigns.\"\n\n3. **Distinct musical heritage**: Ethiopian music is known for its unique vocal techniques (melismatic singing, ornamentation, vocal slides, call-and-response) and specific instruments like the krar (lyre), masenqo (single-string bowed lute), and begena (harp).\n\n4. **Band founder and expert in continental musical practices**: This clearly points to Mulatu Astatke, who is known as the \"father of Ethio-jazz.\" He studied in London, New York, and Boston, blending Ethiopian music with jazz, Latin music, and other continental styles.\n\n5. **Island nation whose traditions blend string and percussion elements**: This describes Cuba, whose music combines Spanish\/European string instruments (like violin) with African percussion elements. Cuban music heavily influenced Ethio-jazz.\n\n6. **Wind instrumentalist and composer who departed homeland**: This appears to be Jos\u00e9 Fajardo (1919-2001), a renowned Cuban flutist and composer who went into exile in the 1960s.\n\n7. **Specific municipality where this artist ultimately resided**: Multiple sources confirm that Jos\u00e9 Fajardo died on June 27, 2001, in New York City. While the sources don't specify a particular borough or smaller municipality within NYC, New York City itself is the municipality where he ultimately resided and died.\n\nBased on the search results, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{New York City}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":0.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":74874.4330406189,"scoring_ms":323.047876358,"total_ms":75197.4809169769,"info":{"raw_question":"Begin with a people known as \"wanderers,\" later recognized for military skills after oppression by a chiefly group.

English authoress whose works are often culturally updated**: Mr. Woodhouse was created by Jane Austen, whose works are frequently adapted and updated in modern culture.\n\n6. **Authoress left unfinished story, begun year she died, set in evolving seaside town, starring young woman from large country family**: Jane Austen began \"Sanditon\" in January 1817 (the year she died) and left it unfinished. It's set in the developing seaside town of Sanditon and features characters including Georgiana Lambe. However, there's also \"The Watsons,\" begun around 1803, which features Emma Watson from a large family.\n\n7. **Her full name?**: The question asks for the full name of the young woman from the unfinished story. Based on the search results, for \"The Watsons\" the protagonist is Emma Watson, and while the search results mention that some adaptations\/completions use \"Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson,\" this appears to be confusing the fictional character with the real actress Emma Watson. The original Jane Austen manuscript simply refers to her as \"Emma Watson.\"\n\nHowever, let me double-check if there's another character that better fits the description. The search results also mention that \"The Watsons\" follows \"the large family of Mr. Watson\" and features \"four sisters,\" which definitely fits the \"large country family\" description.\n\nBased on the chain of connections, the answer should be Emma Watson from \"The Watsons.\"\nsearch\n<arg_key>query<\/arg_key>\n<arg_value>\"Sanditon\" Jane Austen young woman family full name<\/arg_value>\n<arg_key>num_results<\/arg_key>\n<arg_value>10<\/arg_value>\n<\/tool_call>","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":0.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":111617.0637607574,"scoring_ms":860.5868816376,"total_ms":112477.650642395,"info":{"raw_question":"Begin with an American online humorist and public speaker who attended an annual online video event.

Known for their gritty, bluesy sound, they balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm-and-blues-oriented album material, and were part of the British Invasion of the US.\n\nThe Animals rose to prominence with their signature song and transatlantic number-one hit single \"The House of the Rising Sun\", and continued this success with hits such as \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\", \"It's My Life\", \"Don't Bring Me Down\", \"I'm Crying\", \"See See Rider\", and \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\". They underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s, and suffered from poor business management, leading the original incarnation to split up in 1966. Burdon then assembled a mostly new lineup of musicians under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals; the much-changed act moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic and progressive rock band with hits such as \"San Franciscan Nights\", \"When I Was Young\", and \"Sky Pilot\" before disbanding at the end of the decade.[3]\n\nThe original lineup of Burdon, Price, Chandler, Valentine, and Steel reunited for a one-off benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968. They later launched brief comebacks in 1975 and 1983. Several partial regroupings of the original-era members have occurred since then under various names. Altogether, the band has had 10 top-20 hits in both the UK Singles Chart and the US *Billboard* Hot 100. The Animals' original lineup members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### The Animals (1962\u20131966)\n\n[edit]The Animals formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during 1962 and 1963, when Burdon joined the Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo. The original lineup was Burdon (vocals), Price (organ and keyboards), Hilton Valentine (guitar), John Steel (drums), and Bryan \"Chas\" Chandler (bass).[4][5]\n\nOriginally formed as the Alan Price Combo,[1] they changed their name to the Animals. They were supposedly dubbed \"animals\" because of their wild stage act, and the name stuck.[6] In a 2013 interview, Burdon denied this, stating that the name was a tribute to a friend known as \"Animal\" Hogg.[7] In a 2021 interview, Steel affirmed that the name was given to them by Graham Bond.[8]\n\nThe Animals performed fiery versions of the staple rhythm-and-blues repertoire, covering songs by artists such as Jimmy Reed, John Lee Hooker, and Nina Simone. Signed to EMI's Columbia label, their first single was a rocking version of the standard \"Baby Let Me Follow You Down\" (retitled \"Baby Let Me Take You Home\").[9]\n\nIn June 1964, the transatlantic number-one hit \"The House of the Rising Sun\" was released. Burdon's vocals and the particular arrangement, featuring Price's haunting organ riffs, created perhaps the first folk-rock hit.[10][11]\n\nIn October 1964, the Animals visited New York City for concert dates and an appearance on *The Ed Sullivan Show*. They were transported from the airport into Manhattan in a motorcade consisting of Sunbeam Alpine Series IV top-down convertibles with fashion models riding along. The Animals sang \"I'm Crying\" and \"The House of the Rising Sun\". In December, the MGM film *Get Yourself a College Girl* was released, featuring the Animals and the Dave Clark Five. The Animals sang the Chuck Berry song \"Around and Around\" in the film.[12]\n\nBy May 1965, the group was starting to feel internal pressures. Price left because of personal and musical differences, as well as his fear of flying while on tour.[6] He went on to a successful career as a solo artist and with the Alan Price Set. Mick Gallagher filled in for Price on keyboards[13] for a short time until Dave Rowberry replaced Gallagher.[14] Rowberry was on hand for the hit songs \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\" and \"It's My Life\".\n\nMany of the Animals' hits originated from Brill Building songwriters recruited by Mickie Most, but the group, and Burdon in particular, felt this to be too creatively restrictive. As 1965 ended, the group signed a new deal with their American label MGM Records for the US and Canada, and switched to Decca Records for the rest of the world. They also ended their association with Most and began to work with MGM Records producer Tom Wilson, who allowed them more artistic freedom.[15] In early 1966, MGM collected the band's hits on *The Best of The Animals*, and it became their best-selling album in the US. In February 1966, Steel left and was replaced by Barry Jenkins. A leftover rendition of Goffin\u2013King's \"Don't Bring Me Down\" was the group's last hit as the Animals. The next single, \"See See Rider\", was credited to Eric Burdon and the Animals. By September 1966, the original incarnation of the group had split up.[16] Their last batch of recordings was released on the album *Animalism* in November 1966.\n\nBurdon began work on a solo album called *Eric Is Here*, which also featured his UK number-14 solo hit single \"Help Me, Girl\", which he heavily promoted on TV shows such as *Ready Steady Go!* and *Top of the Pops* in late 1966. *Eric Is Here* was Burdon's final release for Decca Records.\n\nBy this time, the Animals' business affairs \"were in a total shambles\" according to Chandler, and the group disbanded.[17][ better source needed]\n\n### Eric Burdon and The Animals (1966\u20131968)\n\n[edit]A group with Burdon, Jenkins, and new sidemen John Weider (guitar\/violin\/bass), Vic Briggs (guitar\/piano), and Danny McCulloch (bass) was formed under the name Eric Burdon and Animals (or sometimes Eric Burdon and the New Animals) in December 1966, and changed direction. The new lineup pursued a fusion of progressive rock, psychedelic, soul, and folk music that was far removed from their original blues-oriented sound.[18]\n\nEarly performances by this group did not include any of the hits for which the original group had become known.[19] Some of the new Animals' hits included \"San Franciscan Nights\", \"Monterey\", and \"Sky Pilot\". Their sound was much heavier than that of the original group, with Burdon screaming more and louder on live versions of \"Paint It Black\" and \"Hey Gyp\". By 1968, they had developed a more experimental sound on songs such as \"We Love You Lil\" and the 19-minute \"New York 1963\u2013America 1968\" from the album *Every One of Us*.\n\nZoot Money was added to the lineup in April 1968, initially as organist\/pianist only, but upon McCulloch's departure, he also took on bass and occasional lead vocals.[20]\n\nIn July 1968, Andy Summers (later the guitarist for the Police) replaced Briggs. Both Money and Summers were formerly of British psychedelic outfit Dantalian's Chariot, and much of this new lineup's set was composed of Dantalian's Chariot songs, which caught Burdon's interest.[21] Because of Money's multi-instrumental load, in live settings, bass was played alternately by Weider and Summers.[22]\n\nBy December 1968, this incarnation of The Animals had dissolved, but their double album *Love Is* was released internationally, featuring the singles \"Ring of Fire\" and \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\".\n\nNumerous reasons have been cited for the breakup, the most famous of which involved an aborted Japanese tour. The tour had been scheduled for September 1968, but was delayed until November after difficulty obtaining visas.[22] Only a few dates into the tour, the promoters (whom the band did not know were *yakuza*) kidnapped the band's manager and threatened him at gunpoint to write an IOU for $25,000 to cover losses incurred by the tour's delay.[22] Correctly surmising that his captors could not read English, he added a note to the IOU that it was written under duress.[23] The *yakuza* released him, but warned that the band and he would have to leave Japan the next day or be killed. The Animals promptly fled the country, leaving all of their tour equipment behind.[22] Money and Summers each pursued solo careers, Weider signed up with Family, and Burdon joined forces with a funk\/R&B\/rock group from Long Beach, California, called War.\n\n### Reunions of the Animals\n\n[edit]The original Animals lineup of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler, and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in December 1968, and reformed in late 1975 to record again.[24] Burdon later said that nobody understood why they had agreed to this short reunion. They embarked on a brief tour in 1976 and shot videos for their new songs such as \"Lonely Avenue\" and \"Please Send Me Someone to Love\". They released an album in 1977 that was aptly titled *Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted*.[25] The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demonstration tapes at that time that were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed with Price and a complete lineup, foreshadowing future events.\n\nAll five original band members reunited in 1983 for the album *Ark* and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, Nippy Noya on percussion, Steve Gregory on saxophone, and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single, \"The Night\", reached number 48 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 chart. The band released a second single called \"Love Is for All Time\", which did not chart.\n\nSongs performed on the *Ark* tour included some from the 1960s, but most were from the band's contemporary repertoire, such as \"Heart Attack\", \"No More Elmore\" (both released a year earlier by Burdon), \"Oh Lucky Man\" (from the 1973 soundtrack album to *O Lucky Man!* by Price), \"It's Too Late\", \"Tango\", and \"Young Girls\" (later released on Burdon's compilation album *The Night*). Their Wembley Arena concert on 31 December 1983 (supporting the Police) was released on the *Rip It to Shreds* live album in 1984 after the Animals had disbanded again. Their 29 November 1983 concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan, was released on 27 February 2008 as *Last Live Show*. A film about the reunion tour was shot but never released.\n\nChandler died from an aneurysm in 1996, putting an end to any possibility of another reunion of the full original lineup.[26]\n\n### Later incarnations\n\n[edit]During the 1990s and 2000s, several groups have called themselves the Animals in part:\n\n- In the 1990s, Danny McCulloch, from the later-1960s Animals, released several albums as the Animals.\n[27]The albums contained covers of some original Animals songs, as well as new ones written by McCulloch. - In 1992, Barry Jenkins joined a reconstituted version of The Animals, including \"New Animals\" members Vic Briggs and Danny McCulloch along with new percussionist Jack McCulloch and Phil Ryan instead of Eric Burdon on lead vocals. The band played the first rock concert held in Red Square, Moscow, as part of a benefit concert for the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n[28] - The band then morphed into Animals and Friends, with Peter Barton on vocals, Rodford, and John E. Williamson on guitar. When Rowberry died in 2003, he was replaced by Mick Gallagher (who had briefly replaced Price in 1965). Danny Handley joined the band in 2009, initially as lead guitarist, but replaced Barton on lead vocals when Barton retired in 2012. This successful lineup continues to tour the world with guests such as Steve Cropper and Spencer Davis.\n- Burdon formed a new backing band in 1998 that was billed as Eric Burdon and the New Animals. This was actually just a renaming of an existing band with whom he had been touring in various forms since 1990. Members of this new group included Dean Restum, Dave Meros, Neal Morse and Aynsley Dunbar. Martin Gerschwitz replaced Morse in 1999 after Ryo Okumoto's brief three-week stint, and Dunbar was replaced by Bernie Pershey in 2001. In 2003, the band started touring as Eric Burdon and the Animals. After the lineup changed in 2006, original guitarist Valentine joined the group for its 2007 and 2008 tours. The group also included Red Young, Paula O'Rourke and Tony Braunagle. After Burdon lost the rights to the name, he formed a new band with different musicians.\n- In 2016, Burdon formed the current lineup of the Animals, including Johnzo West (guitar\/vocals), Davey Allen (keys\/vocals), Dustin Koester (drums\/vocals), Justin Andres (bass guitar\/vocals), Ruben Salinas (sax\/flute) and Evan Mackey (trombone).\n[29]The band performed at the Fool In Love Festival amongst other legendary performers in Los Angeles, CA on 31 August 2024.[30]\n\n### Dispute over ownership of band name\n\n[edit]In 2008, an adjudicator determined that original Animals drummer John Steel owned \"the Animals\" name in the UK because of a trademark registration that Steel had filed. Eric Burdon had objected to the trademark registration, arguing that he personally embodied any goodwill associated with \"the Animals\" name. Burdon's argument was rejected, in part because he had billed himself as \"Eric Burdon and the Animals\" as early as 1967, thus separating the goodwill associated with his own name from that of the band. On 9 September 2013, Burdon's appeal was allowed, and he is now permitted to use the name \"the Animals\".[31]\n\n### Legacy\n\n[edit]The original Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, although Burdon did not attend and the band did not perform.[4] In 2003, the band's version of \"The House of the Rising Sun\" ranked number 123 on *Rolling Stone*'s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. Their 1965 hit single \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\" was ranked number 233 on the same list. Both songs are included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.[32]\n\nOn 15 March 2012, in a keynote speech to an audience at the South by Southwest music festival, Bruce Springsteen discussed the Animals' influence on his music at length, stating, \"To me, the Animals were a revelation. They were the first records with full-blown class consciousness that I'd ever heard.\" Of \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\" (written by two New York songwriters, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil), Springsteen said: \"That's every song I've ever written ...

The research aims to compare the performance on a cancellation task in a virtual environment with traditional assessment methods, analyze the kinematic data of hand movements, and describe the search behavior patterns of patients. Results suggest that VR provides valuable insights into neglect assessment, offering a more interactive and systematic way to evaluate patients' progress.\n\n## Key takeawaysAI\n\n\nAI\n\n- Virtual reality (VR) effectively assesses visuospatial neglect compared to conventional methods.\n- Six out of eight stroke patients displayed significant aberrant search patterns in the VR task.\n- Patients exhibited repeated target pressures indicating impaired spatial working memory and motor perseveration.\n- Hand path ratio (HPR) was higher in patients, indicating less efficient hand movements during search tasks.\n- The VR task identifies subtle performance variations undetectable in traditional testing methods.\n\n## References (28)\n\n- Fullerton KJ, McSherry D, Stout RW.

These tests are highly sensitive and specific for visual neglect and are predictive of daily functional performance.\nQ: What is visual spatial neglect?\nA: Visuospatial neglect constitutes a supramodal cognitive deficit characterized by reduction or loss of spatial awareness for the contralesional space. It occurs in over 40% of right- and 20% of left-brain-lesioned stroke patients with lesions located mostly in parietal, frontal and subcortical brain areas.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_626e1fe70df841768cd1776b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1600-0404.2007.00821.x\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1600-0404.2007.00821.x\nError fetching https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1600-0404.2007.00821.x: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1600-0404.2007.00821.x'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_277ed86d6be74745b5dae915\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Jurgen Broeren\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"virtual reality\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"haptics\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"rehabilitation\\\\\\\" stroke 2004 2007 2008 Gothenburg\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Jurgen Broeren\nURL: https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/citations?user=FO1d4HEAAAAJ&hl=sv\nVirtual reality and haptics as a training device for movement rehabilitation after stroke: a single-case study.

This town's name is shared by a state-managed recreational area also in that county.

This singer's life concluded in another city, which serves as a national capital and rests near a significant highland.

The present work has been developed in the context of the German Medical Informatics Initiative, where 29 university hospitals agreed to the usage of the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for their newly established data integration centers. This standard is optimized to describe and exchange medical data but less suitable for standard statistical analysis which mostly requires tabular data formats.\n\n**Objectives**\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analysis by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should be implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts and offer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n**Methods**\nWe propose the fhircrackr framework, which allows downloading and flattening FHIR resources for data analysis. The framework supports different download and authentication protocols and gives the user full control over the data that is extracted from the FHIR resources and transformed into tables. We implemented it using the programming language R [1] and published it under the GPL-3 open source license.\n\n**Results**\nThe framework was successfully applied to both publicly available test data and real-world data from several ongoing studies. While the processing of larger real-world data sets puts a considerable burden on computation time and memory consumption, those challenges can be attenuated with a number of suitable measures like parallelization and temporary storage mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe fhircrackr R package provides an open source solution within an environment that is familiar to most data scientists and helps overcome the practical challenges that still hamper the usage of EHR data for research.\n\n**Keywords:** Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, electronic health records, health information interoperability, data analysis\n\n## Background and Significance\n\n### Background\n\nThe digitalization of the health sector produces a growing interest in the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for clinical research. With the rise of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the need to share large-scale, near real-time patient data has shifted into focus 1 2 3 and there has been increasing activity in building new infrastructures 4 5 for data integration and data sharing.\n\nIn the context of this growing activity, the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard 6 has developed into one of the most popular interoperability standards worldwide. From the creation of FHIR profiles 7 to the mapping 8 and usage of the FHIR standard for data sharing, data visualization, and data quality assessment, 9 10 11 12 13 a vast number of projects using FHIR continues to grow all over the world.\n\nFollowing this trend, the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) 14 established 29 data integration centers in university hospitals across four consortia to integrate EHR data using FHIR. The FHIR standard focuses on the exchange of health care data and defines around 160 so-called resource types, each of which stands for a distinct entity of information that can be transferred using standard web technologies. 15 While FHIR is well-established as a standard in clinical data exchange, for example, for medical applications, Duda et al 16 have found that it is less commonly used in clinical research. Since FHIR is optimized to describe and transfer medical data of individual patients, it is less tailored to statistical analysis of patient cohorts and other applications requiring tabular data. FHIR resources are represented as interlinked JSON or XML objects instead of the matrix-like structures and cannot be handled by most statistical software. The proposed framework is based on the XML representation of FHIR, which is also used throughout this article.\n\nWe developed a framework for extracting and reshaping data from FHIR resources using the well-established XPath expression language, 17 which allows analysts to create tables from FHIR data that can be processed by any standard statistical or other software that expects tabular data. The framework is implemented in the open-source R package 18 fhircrackr 19 and can be downloaded from the comprehensive R archive network. 20\n\nIn the remainder of this article, we will introduce the basics of the FHIR standard followed by a conceptual description of how the fhircrackr framework builds on this standard. Then, we will illustrate the framework with a reproducible example using open access test data and conclude with a discussion of the framework in light of currently ongoing studies, which use real-world EHR data for statistical analyses in several areas of biomedical research.\n\n### FHIR Basics\n\nThe FHIR standard is used to describe data originating from clinical routine documentation. In this standard, all data elements are represented as so-called FHIR resources. A single FHIR resource holds a specific piece of information like a laboratory measurement, demographic information on a patient, or the description of a medical procedure. A full list of currently defined FHIR resources can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/resourcelist.html*\n. Two simplified examples are shown in\nFig. 1\n, where information on a patient and a measurement of her body temperature are represented in the form of a Patient resource and an Observation resource, respectively.\n\nIdeally, every FHIR resource holds the machine-readable information that is needed to interpret the data including its provenance, the actual data point (e.g., the body temperature measured), the metadata (e.g., the unit and date), and references to other resources the data relates to (e.g., the patient the temperature is taken from). The nested structure of the resource is needed because EHR data, like other kinds of data that is exchanged in discrete units, has an inherently nested structure. In the FHIR R4, the most recent version of the standard, there are around 160 resource types, each of them devoted to a specific kind of medical information. In theory, each FHIR resource is individually retrievable from the server, but for statistical analysis, they are mostly downloaded in bundles. A FHIR bundle is a collection of multiple resources that can be exchanged and processed as a single entity. The FHIR standard is a RESTful specification, which uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication. To download data from the server, the standard describes the so-called FHIR Search paradigm, in which the user specifies the scope of the downloaded data with suitable search parameters and downloads the respective resources using HTTP GET or POST. The details of this paradigm are beyond the scope of this article, however, extensive documentation can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/search.html*\n.\n\nThe structure of the FHIR standard stands in contrast to data formats that are usually employed in data analysis. Most statistical software expects a matrix-like structure, where columns represent features and rows represent observations on the set of features formed by those columns. A single body temperature measurement, for example, could be one cell in a matrix that has patients in rows and measurements of vital signs in columns. In contrast, the FHIR representation of this single cell would be an entire json\/xml object that contains not only the measured temperature value but also references to the patient it is taken from and other metadata. Information that is contained in a single table in a classical data analysis setting is expressed in a large number of interlinked resources when the data is represented in FHIR. Developing a framework bridging the gap between those two representations is the primary goal of this work.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analyses by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should have the following characteristics:\n\nBuild on the communication interface defined by HL7 FHIR.\n\nSupport common authentication protocols used for sensitive data.\n\nBe implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts.\n\nOffer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n\n## Methods\n\nTwo steps are necessary to make FHIR data available for analysis: (1) download the data from the server and (2) transform the data into a table format. To perform those tasks, the fhircrackr framework defines a set of classes and related functions, an overview over which can be found in Fig. 2 . Below, we will describe the necessary steps sequentially.\n\n### Downloading FHIR Data\n\nTo access FHIR data, the fhircrackr framework builds on the FHIR Search paradigm defined by HL7. The framework provides functionalities for the construction of FHIR search expressions via the function\n*fhir_url()*\nand uses the function\n*fhir_search()*\nto download the bundles.\n*fhir_search()*\nallows for basic authentication and Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0\n21\n) as well as automatic paging (sequential download of search result bundles) when the result is distributed over several bundles. Downloads can be done via GET or POST, depending on the use case, and can easily be parallelized when necessary. See\nFig. 3\nfor a representation of the downloading workflow. The downloading functions build on well-established functions from the httr-Package,\n22\nbut extend them by providing mechanisms for automatic paging as well as helper functions for building valid FHIR search requests and handling of common errors. The result of the downloading process is a list of FHIR bundles, which is represented as an S4 class\n23\ncalled\n*fhir_bundle_list*\n. Within this list, a single bundle is an object of class\n*fhir_bundle_xml*\n, an S4 class extending\n*xml_document*\nfrom the xml2 R package.\n24\nThe FHIR bundles can be transformed into tables (referred to as \u201cflattening\u201d) as described in the next section.\n\n### Flattening FHIR Data\n\n#### Resource Types\n\nDepending on the type of search request, a FHIR bundle can contain more than one resource type. When the resources are flattened, the fhircrackr framework constructs one table for each resource type, as shown in Fig. 4 . This is necessary because the variability between resources of different types is larger than the variability between resources of the same type. Putting the data of all resource types in a single table would thus create unreasonably large and sparsely populated tables.\n\n#### Elements to Extract\n\nThere are two modes of flattening the resources, depicted in\nFig. 5\n. Either (1) the entire structure is flattened, that is, every element that occurs in at least one of the resources will be turned into a column of the resulting table, or (2) a predefined subset of the elements is extracted from the resources. The former approach requires little knowledge about the individual structure of the resources but can result in very wide and sparse tables. The latter approach, in contrast, requires some knowledge about the structure of the resources, but will result in more concise and densely populated tables.\nFig. 6\nprovides an overview over the workflow of the flattening process: All information needed to flatten the resources is represented in the class\n*fhir_table_description*\n, which contains the type of resource to target (an object of class\n*fhir_resource_type*\n) and a list of XPath 1.0\n17\nexpressions (an object of class\n*fhir_columns*\n) specifying which elements of the resource to extract into the columns of the resulting table. The function\n*fhir_crack()*\nruns the extraction on all resources in the bundles, with one row being created per resource. If a specified element is not present in one of the resources, the corresponding cell in the resulting table is left empty.\n\nThe generic extraction process based on a user-specified XPath scheme ensures that the framework does not depend on any predefined resource structure, apart from it being valid xml. This has the advantage of making the tool compatible with both standard FHIR resources as well as arbitrary extensions to those resources and makes sure that the tool works on all versions of the FHIR standard, like the past STU3, current R4, and future R5 version.\n\n#### Repeating Elements\n\nTo represent complex EHR data adequately, FHIR resources can contain repeating elements, that is, elements with a cardinality greater than one. The FHIR core specification of the Patient resource, 25 for example, defines a 0* cardinality for the element \u201cPatient.address,\u201d meaning that a single Patient resource can contain zero, one, or multiple address elements. Creating a new column for each instance of the element would greatly inflate the resulting table, as a single resource with 10 address elements would result in 10 address columns. This effect worsens as the number of elements with multiple instances increases. To counteract this issue, the fhircrackr default puts values of repeating elements in the same column, separated by a string that can be defined in the table description, as depicted in Fig. 7 . To be able to tell apart which value belongs to which parent element, the fhircrackr can assign an index to each entry, which is surrounded by prespecified brackets. Together with the XPath or header of the column, the indices allow a reconstruction of the original FHIR structure, including the precise position of every element. We are aware that this default behavior violates the first normal form of database normalization, 26 which states that there should be no columns with sets of values. In consultation with various statisticians, we have however adopted the presented solution, since searching such complex fields in the cases considered here is easier to handle in common statistical packages than distributing the values over several columns or tables.\n\nTo resolve columns with sets of values, the fhircrackr framework provides functionalities to automatically split those values, either into a wide format with multiple columns (called casting), or into a long format with multiple rows (called melting). Fig. 8 illustrates the two approaches: In a cast table, the names of each column reflect the original position of the element and each row represents one resource. In a molten table, the number of columns stays the same and multiple entries are spread over several rows. As opposed to casting, melting is done with respect to a specific element (the address element in this example) and values from all other elements (e.g., the id element) are copied into the newly created rows. Fig. 9 represents the workflow of casting or melting a table with multiple entries.\n\nThe steps described so far only aim at making the data available in tabular form. In addition, common techniques of data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization should precede any statistical analysis, which however is beyond the scope of this article. A good summary of those methods specifically for EHR data is given by Yu et al. 27\n\n#### Recreating Resources\n\nApart from turning FHIR resources into flat tables, the fhircrackr framework also allows data to flow in the opposite direction, creating FHIR resources from flat tables. Because the framework is able to remember the original structure of the resources through column headers and indexing of entries, it is possible to recreate the original resources from the flattened tables. This allows the user to selectively remove or add single elements as well as running more complex computations to augment the original FHIR resources before sending them back to a server.\n\n### R Package fhircrackr\n\nWe implemented the above functionalities in a package called fhircrackr using the programming language R\n1\nand published it under the GPL-3 open source license on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (see \u201cSoftware Availability\u201d below). The package requires R Version 4.1.0 or higher and can be run on any operating system that can run R. While the package does not have specific hardware requirements and can be operated on a standard office notebook, the actual requirements regarding RAM and CPU strongly depend on the use case and the scope of the data being processed.\n\n## Results\n\n### Application to Test Data\n\nTo illustrate the basic functionalities of the package, we have set up a simple project on publicly available test data\n28\nat\n*https:\/\/github.com\/POLAR-fhiR\/fhircrackr_examples*\n. In this project, we investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and hypertensive disease (ICD-10 Code I10 - I15) diagnosed as a comorbidity in a small patient cohort. To achieve this, we need to (1) compute the BMI for each patient from downloaded Observation resources containing body weight and body height measurements and (2) relate it to the diagnosis information given in the Encounter and Condition resources of those patients. First, the code example shows how the function\n*fhir_url()*\nis used to build the appropriate FHIR search request which is then sent to the server using\n*fhir_search()*\n. The resulting list of FHIR bundles contains Patient and Observation resources. To flatten those resources into tables, two table descriptions are defined as shown in\nFig. 10\n.\n\nThe function\n*fhir_crack()*\nis then used to create the two tables and after some data preprocessing, the BMI is computed and a list of patient IDs is used to download the associated Encounter and Condition resources. According to the MII implementation guide,\n29\nwhich profiles an Encounter in the German health care system that is used in the test data, the diagnoses of a Patient are referenced in the Encounter resource and there can be multiple diagnoses listed in one encounter, as shown in\nFig. 11\n. The table created from those Encounters will therefore contain multiple entries in the diagnosis columns, as shown in the top row of\nFig. 12\n. Those multiple diagnoses have to be spread over multiple rows using\n*fhir_melt()*\n, as shown in the middle row of\nFig. 12\nand subsequently be freed from indices with\n*fhir_rm_indices()*\nas shown in the bottom row of the figure. Then, they can be filtered for comorbidity diagnoses. Finally, the patients with a hypertension comorbidity diagnosis can be identified and the relationship between hypertension and BMI can be examined with suitable statistical routines.\n\n### Application to Real-World Data\n\nTo date, fhircrackr is used in a number of ongoing studies within the German MII. In the use case POLAR 30 it is used for a distributed analysis in 13 university hospitals to detect health risks in patients with polypharmacy. The clinical trial HELP 31 uses the package to evaluate a decision support system for bloodstream infections in five university hospitals. Several smaller studies (e.g., refs. 32 and 33) showcase the usage of the fhircrackr in publicly available GitHub repositories. 34 35\n\nIn all these applications, the analysis is distributed in the form of plain or dockered R scripts via version control platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or DockerHub. The scripts generate tabular data on different levels of abstraction from simple feature extraction to more complex local aggregation for distributed learning approaches. All these approaches are easy to implement once the FHIR data has been made available as tables in R.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Usage of Real-World Data\n\nThe use of nested information from real-world EHR data in data science applications has demonstrated difficulties, and som\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/www.thieme-connect.com\/products\/ejournals\/abstract\/10.1055\/s-0042-1760436\n#### Subscribe to RSS\n\nDOI: 10.1055\/s-0042-1760436\n\n# \u201cfhircrackr\u201d: An R Package Unlocking Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources for Statistical Analysis\n\n## Authors\n\nFunding This work was funded in part by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Medical Informatics Initiative in the SMITH Consortium and the POLAR project under the funding numbers 01ZZ1910[A-Z] (POLAR) and 01ZZ1803[A-Z] (SMITH).\n\n## Abstract\n\nBackground The growing interest in the secondary use of electronic health record (EHR) data has increased the number of new data integration and data sharing infrastructures.

The present work has been developed in the context of the German Medical Informatics Initiative, where 29 university hospitals agreed to the usage of the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for their newly established data integration centers. This standard is optimized to describe and exchange medical data but less suitable for standard statistical analysis which mostly requires tabular data formats.\n\n**Objectives**\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analysis by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should be implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts and offer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n**Methods**\nWe propose the fhircrackr framework, which allows downloading and flattening FHIR resources for data analysis. The framework supports different download and authentication protocols and gives the user full control over the data that is extracted from the FHIR resources and transformed into tables. We implemented it using the programming language R [1] and published it under the GPL-3 open source license.\n\n**Results**\nThe framework was successfully applied to both publicly available test data and real-world data from several ongoing studies. While the processing of larger real-world data sets puts a considerable burden on computation time and memory consumption, those challenges can be attenuated with a number of suitable measures like parallelization and temporary storage mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe fhircrackr R package provides an open source solution within an environment that is familiar to most data scientists and helps overcome the practical challenges that still hamper the usage of EHR data for research.\n\n**Keywords:** Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, electronic health records, health information interoperability, data analysis\n\n## Background and Significance\n\n### Background\n\nThe digitalization of the health sector produces a growing interest in the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for clinical research. With the rise of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the need to share large-scale, near real-time patient data has shifted into focus 1 2 3 and there has been increasing activity in building new infrastructures 4 5 for data integration and data sharing.\n\nIn the context of this growing activity, the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard 6 has developed into one of the most popular interoperability standards worldwide. From the creation of FHIR profiles 7 to the mapping 8 and usage of the FHIR standard for data sharing, data visualization, and data quality assessment, 9 10 11 12 13 a vast number of projects using FHIR continues to grow all over the world.\n\nFollowing this trend, the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) 14 established 29 data integration centers in university hospitals across four consortia to integrate EHR data using FHIR. The FHIR standard focuses on the exchange of health care data and defines around 160 so-called resource types, each of which stands for a distinct entity of information that can be transferred using standard web technologies. 15 While FHIR is well-established as a standard in clinical data exchange, for example, for medical applications, Duda et al 16 have found that it is less commonly used in clinical research. Since FHIR is optimized to describe and transfer medical data of individual patients, it is less tailored to statistical analysis of patient cohorts and other applications requiring tabular data. FHIR resources are represented as interlinked JSON or XML objects instead of the matrix-like structures and cannot be handled by most statistical software. The proposed framework is based on the XML representation of FHIR, which is also used throughout this article.\n\nWe developed a framework for extracting and reshaping data from FHIR resources using the well-established XPath expression language, 17 which allows analysts to create tables from FHIR data that can be processed by any standard statistical or other software that expects tabular data. The framework is implemented in the open-source R package 18 fhircrackr 19 and can be downloaded from the comprehensive R archive network. 20\n\nIn the remainder of this article, we will introduce the basics of the FHIR standard followed by a conceptual description of how the fhircrackr framework builds on this standard. Then, we will illustrate the framework with a reproducible example using open access test data and conclude with a discussion of the framework in light of currently ongoing studies, which use real-world EHR data for statistical analyses in several areas of biomedical research.\n\n### FHIR Basics\n\nThe FHIR standard is used to describe data originating from clinical routine documentation. In this standard, all data elements are represented as so-called FHIR resources. A single FHIR resource holds a specific piece of information like a laboratory measurement, demographic information on a patient, or the description of a medical procedure. A full list of currently defined FHIR resources can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/resourcelist.html*\n. Two simplified examples are shown in\nFig. 1\n, where information on a patient and a measurement of her body temperature are represented in the form of a Patient resource and an Observation resource, respectively.\n\nIdeally, every FHIR resource holds the machine-readable information that is needed to interpret the data including its provenance, the actual data point (e.g., the body temperature measured), the metadata (e.g., the unit and date), and references to other resources the data relates to (e.g., the patient the temperature is taken from). The nested structure of the resource is needed because EHR data, like other kinds of data that is exchanged in discrete units, has an inherently nested structure. In the FHIR R4, the most recent version of the standard, there are around 160 resource types, each of them devoted to a specific kind of medical information. In theory, each FHIR resource is individually retrievable from the server, but for statistical analysis, they are mostly downloaded in bundles. A FHIR bundle is a collection of multiple resources that can be exchanged and processed as a single entity. The FHIR standard is a RESTful specification, which uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication. To download data from the server, the standard describes the so-called FHIR Search paradigm, in which the user specifies the scope of the downloaded data with suitable search parameters and downloads the respective resources using HTTP GET or POST. The details of this paradigm are beyond the scope of this article, however, extensive documentation can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/search.html*\n.\n\nThe structure of the FHIR standard stands in contrast to data formats that are usually employed in data analysis. Most statistical software expects a matrix-like structure, where columns represent features and rows represent observations on the set of features formed by those columns. A single body temperature measurement, for example, could be one cell in a matrix that has patients in rows and measurements of vital signs in columns. In contrast, the FHIR representation of this single cell would be an entire json\/xml object that contains not only the measured temperature value but also references to the patient it is taken from and other metadata. Information that is contained in a single table in a classical data analysis setting is expressed in a large number of interlinked resources when the data is represented in FHIR. Developing a framework bridging the gap between those two representations is the primary goal of this work.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analyses by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should have the following characteristics:\n\nBuild on the communication interface defined by HL7 FHIR.\n\nSupport common authentication protocols used for sensitive data.\n\nBe implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts.\n\nOffer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n\n## Methods\n\nTwo steps are necessary to make FHIR data available for analysis: (1) download the data from the server and (2) transform the data into a table format. To perform those tasks, the fhircrackr framework defines a set of classes and related functions, an overview over which can be found in Fig. 2 . Below, we will describe the necessary steps sequentially.\n\n### Downloading FHIR Data\n\nTo access FHIR data, the fhircrackr framework builds on the FHIR Search paradigm defined by HL7. The framework provides functionalities for the construction of FHIR search expressions via the function\n*fhir_url()*\nand uses the function\n*fhir_search()*\nto download the bundles.\n*fhir_search()*\nallows for basic authentication and Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0\n21\n) as well as automatic paging (sequential download of search result bundles) when the result is distributed over several bundles. Downloads can be done via GET or POST, depending on the use case, and can easily be parallelized when necessary. See\nFig. 3\nfor a representation of the downloading workflow. The downloading functions build on well-established functions from the httr-Package,\n22\nbut extend them by providing mechanisms for automatic paging as well as helper functions for building valid FHIR search requests and handling of common errors. The result of the downloading process is a list of FHIR bundles, which is represented as an S4 class\n23\ncalled\n*fhir_bundle_list*\n. Within this list, a single bundle is an object of class\n*fhir_bundle_xml*\n, an S4 class extending\n*xml_document*\nfrom the xml2 R package.\n24\nThe FHIR bundles can be transformed into tables (referred to as \u201cflattening\u201d) as described in the next section.\n\n### Flattening FHIR Data\n\n#### Resource Types\n\nDepending on the type of search request, a FHIR bundle can contain more than one resource type. When the resources are flattened, the fhircrackr framework constructs one table for each resource type, as shown in Fig. 4 . This is necessary because the variability between resources of different types is larger than the variability between resources of the same type. Putting the data of all resource types in a single table would thus create unreasonably large and sparsely populated tables.\n\n#### Elements to Extract\n\nThere are two modes of flattening the resources, depicted in\nFig. 5\n. Either (1) the entire structure is flattened, that is, every element that occurs in at least one of the resources will be turned into a column of the resulting table, or (2) a predefined subset of the elements is extracted from the resources. The former approach requires little knowledge about the individual structure of the resources but can result in very wide and sparse tables. The latter approach, in contrast, requires some knowledge about the structure of the resources, but will result in more concise and densely populated tables.\nFig. 6\nprovides an overview over the workflow of the flattening process: All information needed to flatten the resources is represented in the class\n*fhir_table_description*\n, which contains the type of resource to target (an object of class\n*fhir_resource_type*\n) and a list of XPath 1.0\n17\nexpressions (an object of class\n*fhir_columns*\n) specifying which elements of the resource to extract into the columns of the resulting table. The function\n*fhir_crack()*\nruns the extraction on all resources in the bundles, with one row being created per resource. If a specified element is not present in one of the resources, the corresponding cell in the resulting table is left empty.\n\nThe generic extraction process based on a user-specified XPath scheme ensures that the framework does not depend on any predefined resource structure, apart from it being valid xml. This has the advantage of making the tool compatible with both standard FHIR resources as well as arbitrary extensions to those resources and makes sure that the tool works on all versions of the FHIR standard, like the past STU3, current R4, and future R5 version.\n\n#### Repeating Elements\n\nTo represent complex EHR data adequately, FHIR resources can contain repeating elements, that is, elements with a cardinality greater than one. The FHIR core specification of the Patient resource, 25 for example, defines a 0* cardinality for the element \u201cPatient.address,\u201d meaning that a single Patient resource can contain zero, one, or multiple address elements. Creating a new column for each instance of the element would greatly inflate the resulting table, as a single resource with 10 address elements would result in 10 address columns. This effect worsens as the number of elements with multiple instances increases. To counteract this issue, the fhircrackr default puts values of repeating elements in the same column, separated by a string that can be defined in the table description, as depicted in Fig. 7 . To be able to tell apart which value belongs to which parent element, the fhircrackr can assign an index to each entry, which is surrounded by prespecified brackets. Together with the XPath or header of the column, the indices allow a reconstruction of the original FHIR structure, including the precise position of every element. We are aware that this default behavior violates the first normal form of database normalization, 26 which states that there should be no columns with sets of values. In consultation with various statisticians, we have however adopted the presented solution, since searching such complex fields in the cases considered here is easier to handle in common statistical packages than distributing the values over several columns or tables.\n\nTo resolve columns with sets of values, the fhircrackr framework provides functionalities to automatically split those values, either into a wide format with multiple columns (called casting), or into a long format with multiple rows (called melting). Fig. 8 illustrates the two approaches: In a cast table, the names of each column reflect the original position of the element and each row represents one resource. In a molten table, the number of columns stays the same and multiple entries are spread over several rows. As opposed to casting, melting is done with respect to a specific element (the address element in this example) and values from all other elements (e.g., the id element) are copied into the newly created rows. Fig. 9 represents the workflow of casting or melting a table with multiple entries.\n\nThe steps described so far only aim at making the data available in tabular form. In addition, common techniques of data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization should precede any statistical analysis, which however is beyond the scope of this article. A good summary of those methods specifically for EHR data is given by Yu et al. 27\n\n#### Recreating Resources\n\nApart from turning FHIR resources into flat tables, the fhircrackr framework also allows data to flow in the opposite direction, creating FHIR resources from flat tables. Because the framework is able to remember the original structure of the resources through column headers and indexing of entries, it is possible to recreate the original resources from the flattened tables. This allows the user to selectively remove or add single elements as well as running more complex computations to augment the original FHIR resources before sending them back to a server.\n\n### R Package fhircrackr\n\nWe implemented the above functionalities in a package called fhircrackr using the programming language R\n1\nand published it under the GPL-3 open source license on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (see \u201cSoftware Availability\u201d below). The package requires R Version 4.1.0 or higher and can be run on any operating system that can run R. While the package does not have specific hardware requirements and can be operated on a standard office notebook, the actual requirements regarding RAM and CPU strongly depend on the use case and the scope of the data being processed.\n\n## Results\n\n### Application to Test Data\n\nTo illustrate the basic functionalities of the package, we have set up a simple project on publicly available test data\n28\nat\n*https:\/\/github.com\/POLAR-fhiR\/fhircrackr_examples*\n. In this project, we investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and hypertensive disease (ICD-10 Code I10 - I15) diagnosed as a comorbidity in a small patient cohort. To achieve this, we need to (1) compute the BMI for each patient from downloaded Observation resources containing body weight and body height measurements and (2) relate it to the diagnosis information given in the Encounter and Condition resources of those patients. First, the code example shows how the function\n*fhir_url()*\nis used to build the appropriate FHIR search request which is then sent to the server using\n*fhir_search()*\n. The resulting list of FHIR bundles contains Patient and Observation resources. To flatten those resources into tables, two table descriptions are defined as shown in\nFig. 10\n.\n\nThe function\n*fhir_crack()*\nis then used to create the two tables and after some data preprocessing, the BMI is computed and a list of patient IDs is used to download the associated Encounter and Condition resources. According to the MII implementation guide,\n29\nwhich profiles an Encounter in the German health care system that is used in the test data, the diagnoses of a Patient are referenced in the Encounter resource and there can be multiple diagnoses listed in one encounter, as shown in\nFig. 11\n. The table created from those Encounters will therefore contain multiple entries in the diagnosis columns, as shown in the top row of\nFig. 12\n. Those multiple diagnoses have to be spread over multiple rows using\n*fhir_melt()*\n, as shown in the middle row of\nFig. 12\nand subsequently be freed from indices with\n*fhir_rm_indices()*\nas shown in the bottom row of the figure. Then, they can be filtered for comorbidity diagnoses. Finally, the patients with a hypertension comorbidity diagnosis can be identified and the relationship between hypertension and BMI can be examined with suitable statistical routines.\n\n### Application to Real-World Data\n\nTo date, fhircrackr is used in a number of ongoing studies within the German MII. In the use case POLAR 30 it is used for a distributed analysis in 13 university hospitals to detect health risks in patients with polypharmacy. The clinical trial HELP 31 uses the package to evaluate a decision support system for bloodstream infections in five university hospitals. Several smaller studies (e.g., refs. 32 and 33) showcase the usage of the fhircrackr in publicly available GitHub repositories. 34 35\n\nIn all these applications, the analysis is distributed in the form of plain or dockered R scripts via version control platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or DockerHub. The scripts generate tabular data on different levels of abstraction from simple feature extraction to more complex local aggregation for distributed learning approaches. All these approaches are easy to implement once the FHIR data has been made available as tables in R.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Usage of Real-World Data\n\nThe use of nested information from real-world EHR data in data science applications has demonstrated difficulties, and som\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Based on the search results and content analysis, I can now provide the precise title of the 2023 paper.\n\nThe paper is titled:\n\n**\"fhircrackr\": An R Package Unlocking Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources for Statistical Analysis**\n\nThis paper was published in Applied Clinical Informatics in 2023 and matches all the criteria mentioned in the query:\n\n1. \u2705 **2023 publication** - Confirmed from the search results showing publication dates and metadata\n2. \u2705 **Applied Clinical Informatics** journal - Confirmed from multiple sources\n3. \u2705 **German Medical Informatics Initiative context** - Explicitly mentioned in the abstract and background\n4. \u2705 **FHIR standard challenge** - The paper addresses making FHIR data usable for statistical analysis\n5. \u2705 **Open-source solution** - The fhircrackr package is published under GPL-3 open source license\n6. \u2705 **R statistical programming language** - Implemented specifically in R\n7. \u2705 **\"Crack\" and flatten complex resources** - The package is designed to transform complex FHIR resources into tabular format for researchers\n\nThe paper details how the fhircrackr framework bridges the gap between FHIR's optimized data exchange format and the tabular structures required for statistical analysis, which is exactly the challenge described in the query.\n","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_20170d99f8704757bee18c12\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Julia Palm\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"fhircrackr\\\\\\\" Leipzig medical informatics\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":5}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: \"fhircrackr\": An R Package Unlocking Fast Healthcare ...\nURL: https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36696915\/\nby J Palm \u00b7 2023 \u00b7 Cited by 17 \u2014 \"fhircrackr\": An R Package Unlocking Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources for Statistical Analysis ...

By minimizing the number of incision points, the benefit to SILS includes less postoperative pain and better cosmetic results.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_85a7d29151be4104ab241599\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/000313481508100337\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/000313481508100337\nError fetching https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/000313481508100337: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/000313481508100337'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_96eda0e3edc2453da6020055\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28916955\/\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28916955\/\n# Multicenter, randomized single-port versus multiport laparoscopic surgery (SIMPLE) trial in colon cancer: an interim analysis\n\n-\nPMID:\n**28916955** - DOI: 10.1007\/s00464-017-5842-0\n\n# Multicenter, randomized single-port versus multiport laparoscopic surgery (SIMPLE) trial in colon cancer: an interim analysis\n\n## Abstract\n\n**\nBackground:\n**\nSingle-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) was recently introduced as an innovative minimally invasive surgery method. Retrospective studies have revealed the safety and feasibility of SPLS for colon cancer treatment. However, no prospective randomized trials have been performed. The multicenter, randomized SIMPLE (single-port versus multiport laparoscopic surgery) trial aimed to investigate short-term perioperative outcomes of SPLS for colon cancer treatment, compared with multiport laparoscopic surgery (MPLS).\n\n**\nMethods:\n**\nBetween August 2011 and April 2014, a total of 194 patients with colon cancer were recruited from seven hospitals in Korea. Patients were randomly allocated into the SPLS group (n = 99) or MPLS group (n = 95). The primary endpoint was postoperative complications. Operative, postoperative, and pathologic outcomes were analyzed after 50% of the patient study population had been recruited.\n\n**\nResults:\n**\nThe patients' demographic characteristics, operative times, estimated blood volume losses, numbers of harvested lymph nodes, and lengths of both resection margins were not significantly different between groups. In the SPLS group, the rates of conversion to MPLS and open surgery were 12.9 and 2.2%, respectively. Postoperative complications occurred in 10.8% of the SPLS, and 12.5% of the MPLS patients (p = 0.714). Times to functional recovery, pain scores, and amounts of analgesia were similar between groups.\n\n**\nConclusion:\n**\nThe results of this interim analysis suggested that SPLS is technically safe and appropriate when used for radical resection of colon cancer.

From May 2011 to August 2012, 77 patients underwent primary SIL surgery for colon cancer by one colorectal surgeon. Among them, 61 patients were one-to-one-matched to control patients who had undergone conventional laparoscopic (CL) surgery with a propensity-matched score, and the outcomes were compared. Two hundred forty-seven patients with colon cancer underwent radical colectomy. Of these, 77 patients underwent SIL colectomy. After matching, there were no significant differences in the general characteristics between the patients undergoing the two types of surgery. Operation time was significantly longer in SIL surgery (139 vs 121 minutes, P = 0.001), but procedure time (107 vs 99 minutes, P = 0.069) was not significantly longer than CL surgery after eliminating closure time (31 vs 22 minutes, P < 0.001) from the operation time. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the two groups (3.3 vs 1.6%, P = 1.000). The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 23 and 22 for SIL and CL surgery, respectively (P = 0.332). The mean follow-up period was 15.7 for the SIL group and 21.4 months for the CL group (P < 0.001) with two recurrences in the SIL group (3.3%) and three recurrences in the CL group (4.9%, P = 1.000). Disease-free survival at 20 months did not differ significantly between the two groups (93.3 vs 94.7%, P = 0.939). SIL for colonic malignancy can be safely applied for various types of operations and can provide equivalent oncologic resection and perioperative outcomes compared with CL surgery.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_524aee291635461fa879f01f\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Jung-A Yun zebrafish pigmentation ciliogenesis centrioles Kallmann syndrome\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Variable phenotypes and penetrance between and within different ...\nURL: https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36533556\/\nOur data indicate that variations in phenotypes exist between different TZ mutants, supporting different tissue-specific functions of these TZ genes.\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Zebrafish as a new model for phenotype-based screening ... - PubMed\nURL: https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/17371438\/\nIn this study, we validated zebrafish as a whole-animal model for phenotype-based screening of melanogenic inhibitors or stimulators.\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Modelling Kallmann's syndrome in the zebrafish - Endocrine Abstracts\nURL: https:\/\/www.endocrine-abstracts.org\/ea\/0015\/ea0015oc12\nKallmann's syndrome (KS) is proposed to result from disrupted migration of both olfactory sensory axons and hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ...\n\n---\n\nResult 3: Modelling Kallmann syndrome in the zebrafish - UCL Discovery\nURL: https:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1301396\/\nKallmann syndrome (KS) is a human genetic disorder characterised by delayed\/absent pubertal development, associated with lack of olfaction.

{"example_id":47,"prompt":[{"content":"A mid-19th-century naval vessel, later bearing a name of Teutonic origin associated with a mythological fire deity, was key in the first combat use of a specific type of aerial weapon carrier. This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's. Within this nation's air arm, a specific numerically designated squadron, which had earlier flown other aircraft types against targets such as projectile launch sites, was eventually equipped with this effective fighter.

The 8,000+ V-1 strikes launched against London between June and September 1944 killed 5,500 people, injured 16,000, and forced the evacuation of more than a million.\nQ: How many V1 flying bombs were made?\nA: Production of the V1s numbered 32,000; by March 1945, when the sites were finally overrun by the Allied armies, some 5,500 V1s, each carrying a one-ton warhead, had reached Britain.\nQ: Could a Spitfire catch a V-1?\nA: These V1s first appeared in June '44 ,& were met by the Spitfire mk 1Xs which were considerably quicker than earlier variants. They were capable of catching & destroying the V1. The catch was the time it took to get airborne to intercept them,rendering many attempts too late.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_4d322ae0c3d748efab95081b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Hawker Tempest\\\\\\\" V-1 flying bomb interception RAF propeller fighter\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Hawker Tempest\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hawker_Tempest\nThe Hawker Tempest is a British fighter aircraft \u00b7 Upon entering service in 1944, the Tempest performed low-level interception, particularly against the V-1 ...Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Hawker Tempest V\nURL: https:\/\/www.rafmuseum.org.uk\/research\/collections\/hawker-tempest-v\/\nHawker Tempest V ...

When the course was complete, the 1-ton warhead armed automatically and the engine shut off. The bomb then free-fell onto its target.\nQ: Could a Spitfire catch a V1?\nA: These V1s first appeared in June '44 ,& were met by the Spitfire mk 1Xs which were considerably quicker than earlier variants. They were capable of catching & destroying the V1. The catch was the time it took to get airborne to intercept them,rendering many attempts too late.\nQ: Was the Hawker Tempest a good fighter?\nA: The Hawker Tempest qualifies as one of World War II's most underrated fighters: technically superb in its niche, decisively effective in specific campaigns (notably V\u20101 defense and low\u2010level air superiority), but historically overshadowed by earlier icons and limited by late production.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_e58d3d5f52344ff98b1f4d44\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"No. 501 Squadron RAF\\\\\\\" Hawker Tempest V-1 flying bomb projectile launch sites Germany\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Operation Diver\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operation_Diver\nCleverly estate, Shepherd's Bush, London, after being hit by a V-1 flying bomb, 1945. ...

The squadron won seven battle honours,[4] flying Hurricane, Spitfire and Tempest fighter aircraft during World War II, and was one of the most heavily engaged units in RAF Fighter Command. In particular, the Squadron saw extensive action during the Battle of France and Battle of Britain. At present the unit is not flying any more and has a logistics role as part of No 85 Expeditionary Logistics Wing.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Formation and early years\n\n[edit]The squadron was originally formed as a day-bomber unit named **No 501 (City of Bristol) Squadron**[1] as part of the Special Reserve squadrons on 14 June 1929, made up of volunteers and regulars, flying D.H.9As, which were later replaced with Westland Wapitis and later still with Westland Wallaces. In 1936 it became \"No 501 (County of Gloucester) Squadron\", changing the name to embrace a larger area of recruitment.[3] On 1 May 1936 it was transferred to the Auxiliary Air Force and in July of that year the squadron converted to Hawker Harts. In March 1938 these were exchanged for Hawker Hinds, but at the end of 1938 No. 501 squadron was transferred from RAF Bomber Command to RAF Fighter Command,[1] and Hawker Hurricanes began to arrive in March 1939.\n\n### Second World War\n\n[edit]When war was declared in September 1939, 501 Squadron was based at RAF Filton, near Bristol.\n\nOn 10 May 1940, with the attack on France, the Squadron became part of the Advanced Air Striking Force[13] and moved to France where it saw extensive action, stationed at airfields as B\u00e9theniville, Anglure, Le Mans and Dinard. Sgt J.H. \"Ginger\" Lacey of 501 Squadron shot down three enemy aircraft in a single day to win the Croix de Guerre. (He later returned to England with five victories.) After the retreat from France through Saint Helier, Jersey, its battle-hardened pilots were reorganised at RAF Croydon and then moved on to RAF Middle Wallop and later RAF Gravesend (now Gravesend Airport). It subsequently served at RAF Kenley, south London, commanded by S\/L Harry Hogan, until 17 December 1940 by which time the squadron had claimed 149 enemy aircraft destroyed. Success came at a high cost; in addition to the heavy losses suffered in France, the squadron lost 19 pilots killed during the Battle of Britain, more than any other squadron.\n\nThe squadron re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire in April 1941 and the squadron moved to Northern Ireland in October 1942. In April 1943 the squadron returned to Tangmere for bomber escort work \u2013 some pilots being issued with the Spitfire Mk IXc. Between November 1943 and October 1944 the squadron formed part of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). For Operation Overlord (the Allied invasion of Normandy) it flew the Spitfire V LF operating from RAF Friston in ADGB, though under the operational control of RAF Second Tactical Air Force.[14]\n\nDuring August 1944, the squadron began converting to the Tempest Mk.V at RAF Manston, for the purposes of Operation Diver \u2013 the interception of V-1 missiles. On 23 August, a Tempest flight from the elite Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) was merged into 501 Squadron and S\/L Joe Berry of FIU was appointed commanding officer of the combined unit.[15]\n\nThe squadron was disbanded at RAF Hunsdon at the end of the war on 20 April 1945. During World War II the pilots of No. 501 Squadron had flown 11,140 operational sorties,[16] in which they shot down 201 enemy aircraft and at least 84 V-1s.[17]\n\n### Notable squadron members\n\n[edit]The squadron included several notable pilots of World War II, including Sergeant Pilot Antoni (Toni) G\u0142owacki VM, CV and 3 bars, DFC, DFM, who shot down five German aircraft on 24 August 1940 to become the first of only two pilots to achieve \"Ace-in-a-day\" status during the Battle of Britain.[19][20] Among others who achieved fighter ace status were Ken Mackenzie,[21] \"Ginger\" Lacey,[22] Stanis\u0142aw Skalski,[23] Robert Dafforn,[24] Paul Farnes DFM, Kenneth Lee,[25] Donald McKay, and Percy Morfill. Lacey was one of the highest scoring pilots in the Battle of Britain.[26] Squadron Leader Joseph Berry, DFC & 2 bars, was the top scoring V-1 (flying bomb) ace of the squadron, though he claimed only 10 of his 61 victories whilst flying with 501 Squadron.[27] In addition to these unmanned missiles he also shot down three enemy aircraft.[28]\n\n### Into the jet age\n\n[edit]The squadron was reformed on 10 May 1946 as an Auxiliary Air Force fighter squadron at RAF Filton. In February 1957, Flt Lt John Crossley flew Vampire FB.9 jet WR260 beneath the Clifton Suspension Bridge, before a fatal crash into Leigh Woods.[29][30] This was the last recorded \u2013 and only jet aircraft \u2013 flight under that bridge. The Squadron was disbanded in March 1957, along with all the other Auxiliary units.\n\n### Present role\n\n[edit]In June 2001 No. 501 squadron was reformed in the Force Protection role as 501 (Operational Support) Squadron in 2001 at RAF Brize Norton. 501 Squadrons Gunners provide a reserve of trained manpower for 1 Squadron RAF Regiment, No 4 Force Protection Wing. In 2003, its personnel deployed as part of Operation Telic, the liberation of Iraq. The squadron continues to deploy personnel on Force Protection duties in this region. In 2006 the first 501 Squadron Gunners deployed with 2 Squadron RAF Regiment to Afghanistan, carrying out force protection duties of Kandahar airfield and surrounding areas. This has been continued with members of both Regiment and FP roles mobilising with 1 Squadron RAF Regiment tour of the region (8 August to 9 March). Between November 2006 and April 2007 501 Squadron Gunners also deployed with the Queens Colour Squadron, 63 Squadron RAF Regiment to Basra Iraq. Based at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, 501 (County of Gloucester) Squadron has been newly re-formed to expand the RAF Reserves Logistics capability, recruiting Logistics Officers, Drivers and Suppliers as part of No 85 Expeditionary Logistics Wing of the RAF A4 Force.\n\n## Aircraft operated\n\n[edit]| From | To | Aircraft | Version | Remark |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| August 1929 | March 1930* | Avro 504 | N | Used for training[36]\n|\n| March 1930 | November 1930 | Airco DH.9A | ||\n| September 1930 | March 1933* | Westland Wapiti | Mk.IIa | |\n| January 1933 | July 1936 | Westland Wallace | Mk.I | |\n| March 1936 | July 1936 | Westland Wallace | Mk.II | |\n| June 1935 | March 1937 | De Havilland Tiger Moth | Mk.I | Used for training[36]\n|\n| January 1936 | October 1939 | Avro Tutor | Mk.I | Used for training[36]\n|\n| July 1936 | March 1938* | Hawker Hart | Mk.I | One example used for training till May 1939[37]\n|\n| March 1938 | March 1939* | Hawker Hind | Mk.I | One example used for training till February 1941[37]\n|\n| March 1939 | December 1939 | Fairey Battle | Used for training[36]\n| |\n| March 1939 | May 1941 | Hawker Hurricane | Mks.I, II and X[38] |\n|\n| August 1940 | January 1943 | Miles Magister | Used for training[36]\n| |\n| April 1941 | June 1941 | Supermarine Spitfire | Mk.I | |\n| May 1941 | September 1941 | Supermarine Spitfire | Mk.IIa | One example (P8799) soldiered on till July 1943[39]\n|\n| September 1941 | January 1942 | Supermarine Spitfire | Mk.Va | R7334, nicknamed \"Perfect\"[39]\n|\n| September 1941 | July 1944 | Supermarine Spitfire | Mk.Vb | |\n| 1942 | November 1942 | Miles Master | Used for training[36]\n| |\n| May 1942 | October 1942 | Supermarine Spitfire | Mk.Vc | |\n| November 1943 | July 1944 | Supermarine Spitfire | Mk.IX | |\n| July 1944 | April 1945 | Hawker Tempest | Mk.V | |\n| August 1946 | November 1953 | Harvard | T.2b | Used for training[40]\n|\n| October 1946 | May 1949 | Supermarine Spitfire | LF.16e | |\n| November 1948 | June 1951 | de Havilland Vampire | F.1 | |\n| September 1949 | February 1957 | Gloster Meteor | T.7 | Used for training[40]\n|\n| March 1951 | March 1957 | de Havilland Vampire | FB.5 | |\n| February 1955 | February 1957 | de Havilland Vampire | FB.9 | |\n| September 1955 | February 1957 | Gloster Meteor | F.8 | Used for training[40]\n|\n\n*=Remained in service after replacement as main equipment\n\n## Squadron Stations\n\n[edit]| From | To | Base | Remark |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 14 June 1929 | 28 November 1939 | RAF Filton, Gloucestershire | |\n| 28 November 1939 | 10 May 1940 | RAF Tangmere, West Sussex | |\n| 10 May 1940 | 16 May 1940 | B\u00e9theniville, France | |\n| 16 May 1940 | 2 June 1940 | Anglure, France | |\n| 2 June 1940 | 11 June 1940 | Le Mans, France | |\n| 11 June 1940 | 17 June 1940 | Dinard, France | |\n| 17 June 1940 | 21 June 1940 | RAF Saint Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands | |\n| 21 June 1940 | 4 July 1940 | RAF Croydon, Surrey | |\n| 4 July 1940 | 25 July 1940 | RAF Middle Wallop, Hampshire | |\n| 25 July 1940 | 10 September 1940 | RAF Gravesend, Kent | |\n| 10 September 1940 | 17 December 1940 | RAF Kenley, Surrey | |\n| 17 December 1940 | 9 April 1941 | RAF Filton, Gloucestershire | |\n| 9 April 1941 | 25 June 1941 | RAF Colerne, Wiltshire | |\n| 25 June 1941 | 5 August 1941 | RAF Chilbolton, Hampshire | |\n| 5 August 1941 | 3 July 1942 | RAF Ibsley, Hampshire | |\n| 3 July 1942 | 24 August 1942 | RAF Tangmere, West Sussex | |\n| 24 August 1942 | 8 October 1942 | RAF Middle Wallop, Hampshire | |\n| 8 October 1942 | 10 October 1942 | RAF Hawkinge, Kent | |\n| 10 October 1942 | 19 October 1942 | RAF Middle Wallop, Hampshire | |\n| 19 October 1942 | 30 April 1943 | RAF Ballyhalbert, County Down, Northern Ireland | det. at RAF Eglinton, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland |\n| 30 April 1943 | 17 May 1943 | RAF Westhampnett, West Sussex | |\n| 17 May 1943 | 5 June 1943 | RAF Martlesham Heath, Suffolk | |\n| 5 June 1943 | 12 June 1943 | RAF Woodvale, Merseyside | |\n| 12 June 1943 | 21 June 1943 | RAF Westhampnett, West Sussex | |\n| 21 June 1943 | 21 January 1944 | RAF Hawkinge, Kent | |\n| 21 January 1944 | 4 February 1944 | RAF Southend, Essex | |\n| 4 February 1944 | 30 April 1944 | RAF Hawkinge, Kent | |\n| 30 April 1944 | 2 July 1944 | RAF Friston, East Sussex | |\n| 2 July 1944 | 2 August 1944 | RAF Westhampnett, West Sussex | |\n| 2 August 1944 | 22 September 1944 | RAF Manston, Kent | |\n| 22 September 1944 | 3 March 1945 | RAF Bradwell Bay, Essex | |\n| 3 March 1945 | 20 April 1945 | RAF Hunsdon, Essex | |\n| 10 May 1946 | 5 September 1951 | RAF Filton, Gloucestershire | |\n| 5 September 1951 | 8 October 1951 | RAF Tangmere, West Sussex | |\n| 8 October 1951 | 10 March 1957 | RAF Filton, Gloucestershire |\n\n## Commanding officers\n\n[edit]| From | To | Name |\n|---|---|---|\n| July 1929 | August 1929 | Flt\/Lt.

This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's.

This entity established a subsidiary specializing in solar electricity, a field rapidly advancing in a major South Asian nation which notably utilizes building summits for energy capture. These summit-based energy installations are photovoltaic systems that often channel surplus electricity into the broader power grid.

The metric abbreviation kV for kilovolts is commonly used when talking about transmission line voltages. Commonly used transmission voltages are 69 kV and 138 kV.\nQ: What size wire is needed for static grounding?\nA: Bonding and grounding conductors must be large enough to withstand mechanical damage and must not be smaller than 6 AWG copper. For added flexibility, use braided cable or flexible bonding strap for static grounds on portable or movable equipment.\nQ: What is the maximum voltage used in power transmission?\nA: The highest existing voltage is about 1,000,000 volts AC, phase to phase voltage, with higher voltages to 1,500,000 volts possible. Beyond that, it is not practical , much more economical and reliable to use multiple lines instead of one or two big ones. Power lines are typically in the 115,000 to 765,009 volt range.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_820360e0044e4e98ae8c4a67\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"HVDC ground wire\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"static wire\\\\\\\" voltage rating \\\\\\\"protective ground wire\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"HVDC ground wire\" \"static wire\" voltage rating \"protective ground wire\"","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_a1f626a82b444a9885d72dcc\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"overhead ground wire voltage rating transmission line protection\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Grounding of power transmission towers - ZANDZ.com\nURL: https:\/\/zandz.com\/en\/library\/grounding-of-power-transmission-towers\/\nProtective grounding on overhead line supports with the voltage above 330 kV ...

For brevity, such return paths are called ground returns even if the sea constitutes all or part of the path.\nQ: What is the voltage rating of HVDC?\nA: A high-voltage direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission system uses direct current (DC) for electric power transmission, in contrast with the more common alternating current (AC) transmission systems. Most HVDC links use voltages between 100 kV and 800 kV.\nQ: What is the ground electrode of HVDC?\nA: A ground electrode is typically a large metal ring about 300 - 800 metres in diameter buried approximately three metres in the ground and surrounded by a highly conductive bed of coke. The electrode provides grounding of the HVdc system to the earth when slight imbalances of current occur between the bipole lines.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Let me search for more specific information about the voltage ratings of ground wires or static wires used in transmission systems, particularly focusing on their electrical potential characteristics.\n","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_bd22ef798f1e47b19132b5da\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"ground wire\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"static wire\\\\\\\" voltage rating range transmission line electrical potential\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":8}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Electrical Transmission Towers Explained\nURL: https:\/\/savree.com\/en\/encyclopedia\/electrical-transmission-towers\nAn overhead ground wire (static wire \/ pilot wire) absorbs or deflects lightning strikes, conveying electricity safely to the ground.

This entity established a subsidiary specializing in solar electricity, a field rapidly advancing in a major South Asian nation which notably utilizes building summits for energy capture. These summit-based energy installations are photovoltaic systems that often channel surplus electricity into the broader power grid.

These materials have a processing shape B and a programmed shape A [1]. And when the material is exposed to an appropriate stimulus (in our case: heating above a critical temperature), a one way effect is observed: A \u2192 B (one way effect: 1WE). The objectives of the present study were to find out whether and how often programming can be repeated, whether repeated programming affects the 1WE and how much irreversible strain the material accumulates. We study the effect in dependence of different stress levels, and consider the effect of recovery temperature and recovery time. As a model material we examine the commercial amorphous shape-memory polymer Tecoflex\u00ae and subject it to 50 programming\/1WE cycles. It turns out that programming, cooling, unloading and heating to trigger the 1WE causes an increase of irreversible strain and is associated with a corresponding decrease of the intensity of the 1WE in particular during the first thermomechanical cycles.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nM.

The abstract specifically mentions examining \"whether and how often programming can be repeated\" and \"how much irreversible strain the material accumulates\" over cycles, which directly addresses the endurance of the polymers' key characteristic (the shape memory effect).\n\n\\boxed{Functional Fatigue of Shape-Memory Polymers}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":70807.5037002563,"scoring_ms":430.9320449829,"total_ms":71238.4357452393,"info":{"raw_question":"From a materials institute in Germany's Ruhr area, known for research spanning from NiTi alloys processed via powder metallurgy (published around 2008) to the microstructures of superalloys, emerged a study presented at a Materials Research Society symposium.

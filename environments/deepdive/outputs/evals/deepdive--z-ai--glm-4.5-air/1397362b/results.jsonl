Here are the primary terminologies and frameworks:\n\n## Core Integration Frameworks\n\n**Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC)** - The overarching paradigm that unifies wireless sensing (radar, environmental monitoring, localization) with data transmission into a single system, waveform, and hardware platform. ISAC enables improved spectral efficiency, reduced hardware redundancy, and low-latency situational awareness.\n\n**Dual-functional Radar Communications (DFRC)** - Systems that use a single transmit waveform for both radar sensing and communication functions simultaneously, representing a deeper level of integration where both functions are jointly designed and optimized from the start.\n\n**Joint Communications and Radar\/Radio Sensing (JCAS)** - A broader category encompassing various approaches to combining communication and radar functionalities, including communication-centric (JCR), radar-centric (JRC), and dual-functional designs.\n\n## System Integration Levels\n\n**Application-Level Integration** - Sensing and communication systems remain physically separate but exchange information at higher layers (e.g., sensor-assisted communications).\n\n**Spectrum-Level Integration** - Both functions share spectral, temporal, or spatial resources and may share hardware components.\n\n**Full Integration** - Sensing and communications share the same waveform and spectrum simultaneously, requiring merged transceiver hardware and tightly coupled signal processing.\n\n## Key Technical Terminologies\n\n**Waveform Co-design** - The central technical challenge of designing signals that satisfy both communication and sensing requirements, including:\n\n- **Modified Sensing Waveforms**: FMCW chirps with phase\/symbol modulation (PC-FMCW, CPM-LFM)\n- **Augmented Communication Waveforms**: OFDM, OTFS (Orthogonal Time Frequency Space)\n- **Novel Dual-Functional Waveforms**: OCDM (Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing), AFDM (Affine Frequency-Division Multiplexing)\n\n**Mutual Information Framework** - Analytical approach using Communication MI and Sensing MI\/SMI to quantify performance trade-offs and achievable rate regions.\n\n**Radar-Communication Coexistence (RCC)** - Approaches for simultaneous operation without interference, including opportunistic spectrum access, interference channel estimation, and precoder design.\n\n## Network Architecture Concepts\n\n**Distributed ISAC** - Multi-cell and network-level designs enabling collaborative and distributed sensing\/communication with geometric diversity and scalability.\n\n**Multi-beam ISAC** - Leveraging beam-space separation where communication beams are stable while sensing beams are dynamically steered\/scanned.\n\n**Hybrid Analog-Digital Beamforming** - Hardware approaches for phased array, fully digital MIMO, and hybrid array architectures.\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\n**Sensing Metrics**: Probabilities of detection and false alarm, range\/velocity\/angular resolution, Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR), Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound (CRB)\n\n**Communication Metrics**: SINR, Bit Error Rate (BER), outage probability, capacity, latency, throughput\n\n**Trade-off Metrics**: Pareto optimality, rate-distortion analysis, Subspace Tradeoff (ST), Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT)\n\n## Enabling Technologies\n\n**Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)** - Passive metasurface arrays that manipulate EM waves for enhanced communication and sensing paths.\n\n**AI\/ML Integration** - Deep neural networks for waveform design, channel prediction, adaptive control, and solving high-dimensional optimization problems.\n\n**Massive MIMO** - Highly directional arrays supporting multi-beam operation and spatial multiplexing.\n\n## Standardization Efforts\n\n**ETSI ISG ISAC** - European Telecommunications Standards Institute working on ISAC specifications for 6G.\n\n**3GPP ISAC** - Cellular standards body defining ISAC use cases and requirements.\n\n**ITU-R IMT-2030** - International Telecommunication Union framework for future mobile technologies.\n\nThis terminology reflects the evolution from separate radar and communication systems toward integrated, multifunctional platforms that leverage shared hardware, waveforms, and processing capabilities to achieve unprecedented spectral efficiency and functionality.\n[Execution time: 95.33s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Perfect!

As the attack unfolded, Jadhav and other temple staff witnessed the terrorists killing visitors. In response, Jadhav rushed across a 200-foot walkway to the main shrine and secured the sanctum sanctorum by closing and locking the heavy doors, preventing the attackers from entering. This action helped protect hundreds of devotees inside the main temple complex while security forces arrived to neutralize the threat. His intervention is credited with potentially saving many lives during the terrorist attack that killed 30 people and injured over 80 others.\n[Execution time: 79.04s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Perfect!

State of UP* (1957) confirmed the law exists to \"respect the religious susceptibilities of persons of different religions\"\n- Courts recognize India's \"vast disparities in language, culture and religion\" and the need to prevent \"unwarranted and malicious criticism\" that could incite hatred\n- The law aims to prevent the \"inevitable consequence of writing [that] is the excitement of feelings of hatred between the followers of two religions\"\n\n**Contemporary Impact:**\n- Creates a tension between protecting religious sentiments and freedom of expression\n- Seen by some as a tool for communal harmony, by others as potentially inflammatory\n- Continues to be debated in relation to India's secular framework and religious diversity\n\nThe colonial origins of Section 295A reflect its original purpose as a tool for managing communal tensions in a diverse society, though its application continues to evolve in contemporary India's complex religious landscape.\n[Execution time: 39.98s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Based on my comprehensive research, I can now synthesize the complete answer to this complex riddle.

Shows significant reduction in neurotoxicity and improvement in nerve function\\n\\n**Astragalus Injection (AI)**\\n- Shown effective in reducing grade I neurotoxicity incidence\\n- Often ranked among the most promising TCMIs for neuroprotection\\n- Works through antioxidant and immune-modulating effects\\n\\n**Shenmai Injection (SMI)**\\n- Effective in reducing higher-grade neurotoxicity (grade III-IV)\\n- Contains ginseng and Ophiopogon japonicus\\n- Demonstrated ability to protect nerve tissue damage\\n\\n## Mechanisms of Action\\n\\n1. **Mitochondrial protection** - Prevents loss of mitochondrial membrane potential\\n2. **Anti-oxidative effects** - Reduces reactive oxygen species production\\n3. **Neurotrophic support** - Promotes axon growth and nerve regeneration\\n4. **Anti-inflammatory effects** - Inhibits inflammatory pathways including NF-\u03baB\\n\\n## Clinical Evidence\\n\\n- Multiple randomized controlled trials conducted in China\\n- Studies showed significant reductions in neurotoxicity incidence and severity\\n- Network meta-analysis of 13 TCMIs involving 3,598 patients identified SFI, SMI, and AI as most promising\\n- Typical results showed 30-50% reduction in neuropathy incidence\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n- Most studies were conducted in Chinese populations\\n- Limited long-term follow-up data\\n- Need for more rigorous, multi-center clinical trials\\n- Western medical guidelines do not currently recommend any preventive agents for taxol neuropathy\\n\\nThe research indicates that TCM injections, particularly Shenfu, Astragalus, and Shenmai, have shown promising results in preventing taxol-induced peripheral neuropathy through multiple neuroprotective mechanisms.', 'Beijing University of Chinese Medicine researchers published a randomized controlled trial showing that acupuncture significantly improves chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy symptoms when combined with medication, with statistically significant

Recoverable Extensional Flow in Film Production (PMC Document):**\\n- Polymer films are stretched and frozen under tension, storing recoverable deformation that affects final product properties\\n- Shrink films exploit the recovery of frozen recoverable deformations when heated\\n- Elastic components of elongational flow dominate processing operations like film extrusion and drawing\\n- Stress analysis must account for both viscous and elastic behavior, as extensional flow cannot be derived from shear rheology alone\\n\\n**2. Extensional Flow Properties (NPL Document):**\\n- Converging flow geometry is used to determine shear stress and entrance pressure drop values\\n- Extensional flow analysis involves measuring stress development in narrowing ducts\\n- Critical stress values limit maximum processing rates in extrusion operations\\n\\n**3. Filament Stretching Rheometry (DTU Document):**\\n- Filament stretching rheometers (FSR) measure elongational viscosity by maintaining constant elongational rates\\n- Force measurements and geometry tracking enable stress analysis during deformation\\n- Polymer melts exhibit highly elastic behavior under extensional flow conditions\\n- Iterative methods ensure accurate strain rate control for reliable stress data\\n\\n## Stress Analysis Applications\\n\\n**Film Production:**\\n- **Stress distribution** varies across film thickness during biaxial stretching\\n- **Elastic recovery** affects dimensional stability and shrinkage behavior\\n- **Strain hardening** improves uniformity of deformation in stretching processes\\n\\n**Processing Conditions:**\\n- **Critical stress** limits maximum extrusion rates\\n- **Entrance flow effects** create elastic extensions that influence extrudate swell\\n- **Temperature independence** of recoverable elongation in certain ranges affects process control\\n\\n**Material Characterization:**\\n- **Molecular structure** (broadened molar mass distribution, long-chain branching) increases elastic effects\\n- **Hencky strain** up to 6 achievable in controlled extensional measurements\\n- **Trouton ratio** analysis compares elongational to shear viscosity for material property assessment\\n\\nThe research demonstrates that comprehensive stress analysis in polymer film production requires understanding both the viscous and elastic components of extensional flow behavior, particularly in the complex geometries used in manufacturing processes.', '\\\\text{No specific research from a Midwestern university on fluoropolymer melt flow and extensional properties from before the 1990s was found in the search results.}', '\\\\text{No specific information found about a department head at a Southeastern university who specializes in polymer fluid dynamics using bead-spring models.}']\n[Execution time: 83.62s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_01220a90f07e455490af6720\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"llm_batch(prompts=[\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for 'University of Minnesota' 'fluoropolymer' 'melt flow' 'extensional'\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for 'University of Illinois' 'fluoropolymer' 'melt flow' 'extensional'\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for 'fluoropolymer melt flow' 'film blowing' 'stress analysis' before 1990\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for 'two part series' 'polymer melt flow' 'stress history' optical methods\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for 'MIT' 'fluoropolymer' 'melt flow' 'extensional'\\\\\\\"\\\\n])\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 5 call(s) in 50.07s\n  [0]: 10545 tokens, 5 tool calls, 25.49s \u26a0 max turns\n  [1]: 15025 tokens, 5 tool calls, 22.45s \u26a0 max turns\n  [2]: 78989 tokens, 5 tool calls, 50.05s \u26a0 max turns\n  [3]: 10638 tokens, 5 tool calls, 23.74s \u26a0 max turns\n  [4]: 15934 tokens, 2 tool calls, 23.15s \u2713\nOut[3]: ['\\\\text{No specific research found from University of Minnesota matching the query \"fluoropolymer melt flow extensional\"}', '\\\\text{No specific research paper directly addressing all four keywords together (University of Illinois, fluoropolymer, melt flow, extensional) was found.

It championed the use of statistical learning and informatics to bridge the often non-linear gap between material structure and properties across vastly different dimensions. This approach integrated computational thermodynamics and kinetic simulations into a powerful infrastructure. One of the authors, who held faculty positions involving interdisciplinary engineering chairs after moving from the East Coast (following earlier stints at MIT, Cambridge, and in Canada) to the Midwest around this time, brought expertise in applying informatics to diverse problems \u2013 from atom-by-atom analysis of irradiated alloys and metallic glass formation to high-throughput screening and designing biomaterials.

how to immobilize or restrict the motion of objects using obstacles or \"fingers.\"\n\n3. **Key concepts** from his work:\n   - Using topological techniques to understand caging problems\n   - Configuration spaces and their connected components\n   - Linking numbers and homological methods\n   - Dichotomy theorems (e.g., either you can pull an object through obstacles or rotate it within a bounded region)\n   - Applications to robotics, sensor networks, and motion planning\n\n4. **Mathematical tools** used include:\n   - Homological algebra and Meyer-Vietoris sequences\n   - Alexander duality\n   - Configuration spaces of Euclidean motions (which have topology of solid tori)\n   - Winding and linking numbers\n\n5. **Impact**: His work shows how topological methods can provide deeper insight and potentially new algorithms for problems that might seem purely geometric.\n\nThe phrase \"Baryshnikov Bell Labs topology\" most commonly refers to this specific line of research combining algebraic topology with robotics applications that Baryshnikov developed while working at Bell Labs.\n[Execution time: 79.98s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_57b1d64068604f65b4934e51\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{}\", \"name\": \"call_python_reensor\\n<tool_call>code<\/arg_key>\\n<arg_value># Let me search for the exact title of the paper\\nquery = \\\"Baryshnikov Brady Bressler quantum walk exact title\\\"\\nresult = llm_batch([query])\\nprint(result[0]['content'][:600])<\/arg_value>\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"'call_python_reensor\\n<tool_call>code<\/arg_key>\\n<arg_value># Let me search for the exact title of the paper\\nquery = \"Baryshnikov Brady Bressler quantum walk exact title\"\\nresult = llm_batch([query])\\nprint(result[0][\\'content\\'][:600])<\/arg_value>'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_04ac633380eb49a8a248c626\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Let me search for the exact title of the paper\\\\nquery = \\\\\\\"Baryshnikov Brady Bressler quantum walk exact title\\\\\\\"\\\\nresult = llm_batch([query])\\\\nprint(result[0]['content'][:600])\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 1 call(s) in 12.04s\n  [0]: 6339 tokens, 3 tool calls, 12.04s \u2713\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\/tmp\/rlm_worker.py\", line 186, in <module>\n    value = eval(\n            ^^^^^\n  File \"<cell>\", line 4, in <module>\nTypeError: string indices must be integers, not 'str'\n[Execution time: 42.15s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_24b6a236cb8e4ed48dde394c\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Let me search for the exact title of this paper\\\\nquery = \\\\\\\"Baryshnikov Brady Bressler quantum walk exact title\\\\\\\"\\\\ntry:\\\\n    result = llm_batch([query])\\\\n    if result and len(result) > 0:\\\\n        content = result[0]\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Content:\\\\\\\", content[:800])\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"No results found\\\\\\\")\\\\nexcept Exception as e:\\\\n    print(f\\\\\\\"Error: {e}\\\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n# Let me try a different query approach\\\\nquery2 = \\\\\\\"Two-dimensional Quantum Random Walk Baryshnikov Brady Bressler\\\\\\\"\\\\nresult2 = llm_batch([query2])\\\\nprint(\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nSecond query result:\\\\\\\", result2[0] if result2 else \\\\\\\"No result\\\\\\\")\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 1 call(s) in 11.49s\n  [0]: 2236 tokens, 1 tool calls, 11.48s \u2713\nContent: \"Two-dimensional quantum random walk\"\nllm_batch: 1 call(s) in 9.92s\n  [0]: 5464 tokens, 2 tool calls, 9.91s \u2713\n\nSecond query result: \\text{Two-dimensional Quantum Random Walk by Yuliy Baryshnikov, Wil Brady, Andrew Bressler, and Robin Pemantle, published in Journal of Statistical Physics, Volume 142, pages 78-107 (2011)}\n[Execution time: 33.82s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_4fbaf8ba166e49d5b15b973b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Great!

This work ventured beyond one dimension, analyzing how quantum probability distributions spread across a plane.\n\nThe study focused on the 'feasible region' and its limiting shape, surprisingly linking it to algebraic geometry. The methods employed relied heavily on analyzing generating functions, echoing approaches refined by a well-regarded probability expert at an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, known for his work in combinatorics and recognized by multiple fellowships (including one bearing the name of a notable mathematician and hedge fund founder).\n\nOne key author on this paper, then affiliated with a major industrial research laboratory in New Jersey famed for its foundational contributions to communications technology, had previously published on diverse topics: applying topological invariants like the Euler characteristic to sensor network problems, comparing congestion patterns in hyperbolic versus Euclidean network models, and exploring geometric relationships involving simplices and Gaussian samples during his earlier research period in Germany. Another collaborator was based in the prominent technology hub of Redmond, Washington.\n\nWhat is the full, exact title of this paper on quantum walks?"},"answer":"Two-dimensional Quantum Random Walk","judge_reward_func":1.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0,"sub_llm_call_count":24.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":334734.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":13986.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":74.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":98.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":20.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":5.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":1.2,"turns":22.0,"prompt_tokens":96820.0,"completion_tokens":4028.0,"total_tool_calls":22.0}

type known for its unrestricted forwarding, a characteristic that became problematic. This issue spurred the development of new remote access protocols. One such intermediate protocol, which verified a user's ability to receive mail before allowing them to send, was itself superseded. This successor protocol, standardizing sender login, is fundamental to the operation of a type of software agent that processes outgoing mail from the user's application, often using a distinct, designated communication channel. This agent, in turn, cooperates with a different agent for the actual routing of messages between various computer systems. While this routing agent functions in the background, the end-user interacts directly with software acting on their behalf. If such user-facing software, exemplified by a web navigation application on a specific model of tablet computer from the early 2010s, transmits an identification string, what particular sequence of characters and numbers, denoting the core rendering engine technology it is built upon, would appear after the details specifying the device and its operating system, but before any mention of compatibility with other rendering engines?"},"answer":"AppleWebKit\/531.21.10","judge_reward_func":0.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":50.0,"prompt_tokens":193813.0,"completion_tokens":4497.0,"total_tool_calls":50.0}

monuments showing women aiding someone in healthcare:\n\n## Vietnam Women's Memorial (Washington DC)\n- **Description**: A deeply moving statue showing one nurse supporting a wounded soldier in a pieta-like embrace, another nurse looking up into the sky, and a third nurse kneeling as if in prayer\n- **Honors**: 265,000 women active in the Vietnam War, with 11,000 on the ground in Vietnam (90% were nurses)\n- **Significance**: Shows nurses actively providing healthcare assistance to wounded soldiers in combat conditions\n\n## Spanish-American War Nurses Monument (Arlington National Cemetery)\n- **Dedicated to**: Brave women volunteers who nursed the wounded and sick during the Spanish-American War\n- **Location**: Nurses' Section, Section 21 at Arlington National Cemetery\n- **Significance**: One of the earliest monuments specifically honoring women's healthcare service\n\n## Frieze at Shaughnessy Hospital (Vancouver, 1940)\n- **Artist**: Beatrice Lennie, commissioned for the original entrance of Shaughnessy Military Hospital\n- **Description**: Two-panel marble sculpture showing \"a nursing sister assisting a wounded soldier\" and \"a surgeon lifting a wounded soldier\"\n- **Significance**: Directly depicts a nurse aiding an injured soldier in a healthcare setting\n\n## Corner Statues Cathedral Place (Vancouver, 1929)\n- **Description**: 11-foot-high terra cotta statues depicting Nursing Sisters of World War I on each corner of the Medical-Dental Building\n- **Artist**: Joseph Francis Watson\n- **Significance**: Honors the Nursing Sisters credited with saving the life of one of the architects during WWI\n\n## Edith Cavell Monument (London, 1919)\n- **Subject**: Nurse Edith Cavell who became a First World War heroine\n- **Significance**: Commemorates a pioneering nurse who established modern nursing standards and aided soldiers in healthcare during WWI\n\n## Military Nurses Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery)\n- **Dedicated**: Initially to honor nurses who served in World War I\n- **Rededicated in 1971**: \"To Commemorate Devoted Service to Country and Humanity By Army, Navy, and Air Force\"\n- **Significance**: Represents the collective service of military nurses in providing healthcare\n\nThese monuments from the early 20th century primarily commemorate women who served as nurses during wartime, providing direct healthcare assistance to wounded soldiers and demonstrating the crucial role women played in healthcare during this period.\n\nTask 3: \\text{Metal-containing biocatalysts (metalloenzymes) are enzymes that use metal ions as essential cofactors for catalysis, forming metal-binding sites through coordination with amino acid residues like histidine, cysteine, and aspartate\/glutamate. These enzymes account for nearly half of all proteins and perform critical biological functions including photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen fixation.}\n\nTask 4: The primary research method using magnets and radio waves to study protein complexes is **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy**. Here are the key approaches:\n\n## Core Methods\n\n### 1. **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**\n- **Principle**: Exploits the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei (\u00b9H, \u00b9\u00b3C, \u00b9\u2075N) in a strong magnetic field, using radio frequency pulses to manipulate nuclear spins and detect signals.\n- **Applications**:\n  - **Structure determination**: Provides atomic-resolution 3D structures of protein complexes by measuring distances between nuclei (via NOE) and angles (via coupling constants).\n  - **Dynamic analysis**: Studies protein flexibility, conformational changes, and binding kinetics across timescales from picoseconds to hours.\n  - **Interface mapping**: Identifies binding sites and interaction surfaces.\n\n### 2. **Key NMR Techniques for Protein Complexes**\n- **Chemical Shift Perturbation (CSP)**: Monitors changes in NMR chemical shifts upon binding to locate interaction interfaces and measure binding affinities (K<sub>D<\/sub>).\n- **Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE)**: Uses paramagnetic probes to detect solvent accessibility changes at binding interfaces.\n- **Intermolecular NOE**: Measures through-space nuclear Overhauser effects between proteins to determine interatomic distances (\u22646 \u00c5).\n- **Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs)**: Provide long-range angular restraints for determining relative orientations of protein domains.\n- **Isotope-edited\/filtered experiments**: Separate intramolecular and intermolecular signals in labeled\/unlabeled protein complexes.\n\n### 3. **Sample Preparation**\n- Isotopic labeling (\u00b9\u00b3C, \u00b9\u2075N) for enhanced sensitivity and signal assignment.\n- Solution-state NMR under near-physiological conditions.\n- Specialized methods for large complexes (>50 kDa), including deuteration and selective labeling.\n\n### 4. **Data Analysis**\n- **Structure calculation**: Software like XPLOR-NIH, CYANA, or RosettaNMR uses experimental restraints to generate 3D models.\n- **Validation**: Ensemble structures refined against multiple NMR observables.\n\n## Complementary Methods\n- **Solid-state NMR**: For membrane protein complexes and crystals.\n- **Hybrid approaches**: Integration with cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography for larger complexes.\n\n## Advantages\n- Atomic-resolution structural and dynamic information\n- Works in solution under physiological conditions\n- Detects transient states and conformational changes\n- Applicable to challenging targets like intrinsically disordered proteins\n\nNMR remains the gold standard for studying protein complexes at atomic resolution while capturing their dynamic behavior in near-native environments.\n\nTask 5: proteomics\n\nTask 6: The key databases that archive protein blueprints\/structures are:\n\n## Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) Consortium\nThe wwPDB is the single global archive of experimentally determined 3D protein structures since 1971. It consists of four main partners:\n\n1. **RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB)** - US-based partner, provides tools for exploration, visualization, and analysis\n2. **Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe)** - UK-based partner, collects and disseminates macromolecular structure data\n3. **Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj)** - Japanese partner, maintains global archives with integrated tools\n4. **Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB)** - Specializes in NMR data and magnetic resonance entries\n\n## AlphaFold Protein Structure Database\n- Provides over 200 million AI-predicted protein structures using Google DeepMind's AlphaFold\n- Covers broad UniProt proteome with structures for humans and 47 other key organisms\n- Includes human proteome and manually curated Swiss-Prot subset downloads\n\n## ModelArchive\n- Database for computational protein structure models not based on experimental data\n- Provides stable accession codes (DOIs) for theoretical models\n- Includes high-quality predicted protein complexes from RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold\n- Integrates with PDBe-KB for enhanced accessibility\n\n## NCBI Protein Database\n- Collection of protein sequences and translations from GenBank, RefSeq, and TPA\n- Provides sequence-based protein information alongside structural data\n\nThese databases collectively serve as comprehensive archives for both experimentally determined and computationally predicted protein structures, enabling breakthroughs in structural biology, drug discovery, and molecular research.\n[Execution time: 111.79s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Now I need to synthesize these findings and identify the specific key database.

Key aspects include:\n\n- **Structure Determination**: NMR provides atomic-resolution structures of proteins in solution, complementing X-ray crystallography\n- **Dynamic Studies**: Unlike crystallography, NMR excels at studying protein dynamics, conformational changes, and interactions in near-physiological conditions\n- **Size Limitations**: Most effective for proteins <20 kDa, though new methods are extending this range\n\n## Relationship with Protein Structure Databases\n\n### Protein Data Bank (PDB)\n- NMR-derived structures are deposited in the PDB alongside X-ray and cryo-EM structures\n- PDB archives experimental data including chemical shifts, NOEs (nuclear Overhauser effects), and distance restraints used in NMR structure calculations\n- The PDB provides standardized formats (PDB, mmCIF) for sharing and accessing structural data\n\n### Database Integration\n- **UniProt**: Links protein sequence information with structural data from PDB\n- **SpecDB**: Specialized databases for archiving NMR spectra and experimental data\n- **Resource Integration**: Structural databases integrate NMR data with functional annotations, enabling structure-function relationship analysis\n\n## Complementary Roles in Structural Proteomics\n\n1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: NMR + X-ray crystallography provide complementary structural data for different protein types and conditions\n2. **High-Throughput Applications**: NMR has been successfully applied in large-scale structural genomics projects\n3. **Data Integration**: NMR data in databases supports computational prediction of protein functions and drug design\n4. **Validation**: NMR structures validate computational predictions and provide insights into protein flexibility\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Solution-Phase Studies**: NMR provides structures in solution, closer to physiological conditions than crystal structures\n- **Dynamic Information**: NMR reveals protein flexibility and conformational changes that are crucial for understanding protein function\n- **Database Synergy**: Integration of NMR data into protein structure databases enables comprehensive analysis of structure-function relationships\n\nThe relationship is synergistic: NMR provides unique structural and dynamic data that feeds into protein structure databases, which in turn enable large-scale proteomics research and functional annotation of proteins.\n[Execution time: 53.92s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Based on all the research, let me now provide the final synthesized answer.

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk.

American preservation reflects a deep emotional connection to the \"little red schoolhouse\" as a national symbol, while Norwegian culture views these buildings more as functional historical artifacts rather than symbols of national identity.\n\nThe study demonstrates how similar historical objects can be interpreted and valued differently based on cultural narratives and contemporary societal needs.\n[Execution time: 163.21s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Perfect!

This particular unit is recognized for its historical sultanates and a prominent historical figure who, following a period of banishment, established his own coastal dominion. The principal urban center of this newly formed dominion, an ancient port, is noted to have developed as an outpost concurrently with a neighboring settlement, both under the authority of an earlier, formidable medieval empire. This neighboring settlement, also originating in that historical period, was another territory controlled by this extensive empire, which was distinguished by its management of vital watercourses and its far-reaching trade networks before its power waned, enabling one of its own military commanders to rise to prominence. This commander, having previously served the declining empire, successfully broke away to institute his own dynastic sovereignty. The resultant state governed by this commander's lineage held sway over several areas, including a notable town celebrated for an annual traditional combat festival. This town, identified by its cultural festival and the geodetic system it employs, bases this system on a particular defined mathematical representation of the Earth.

PI-3K\/Akt Pathway**\n- Activated by acetaldehyde and ethanol\n- Regulates \u03b12(I) collagen and fibronectin gene expression\n- Involved in cell survival and proliferation signals\n\n**3. Protein Kinase C (PKC) Pathway**\n- Upstream of ERK1\/2 and JNK\n- Acetaldehyde increases PKC translocation to membrane fractions\n- Mediates calcium-independent collagen gene transcription\n\n**4.

The American Academy of Pediatrics 2018 guideline recommends avoiding hypotonic solutions outside the neonatal period, adding potassium (10-20 mEq\/L) and dextrose as appropriate, and monitoring electrolytes within 24 hours. For specific electrolyte emergencies, hyponatremia is treated with hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) at controlled rates, hypernatremia requires gradual correction with calculated free water deficits, and hypokalemia is managed with oral or IV potassium depending on severity. These guidelines represent a shift from previous practices that favored hypotonic solutions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n=== SUB-TASK 5: Search for Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence 2005 publications ===\n\n\\textbf{Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence (ARCHE) 2005 Publications:}\n\n1. \\textbf{Title:} Intravenous immunoglobulin for presumed viral myocarditis in children and adults\n   \\textbf{Authors:} Robinson J, Hartling L, Vandermeer B, Klassen TP\n   \\textbf{Journal:} Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 1\n   \\textbf{Article No.:} CD004370\n   \\textbf{DOI:} 10.1002\/14651858.CD004370.pub2\n   \\textbf{Institution:} Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence (ARCHE), Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta\n\n2. \\textbf{Title:} Children in reviews: methodological issues in child-relevant evidence syntheses\n   \\textbf{Authors:} Swingler G, Williams K, Hartling L, Moyer V, Cramer [Full citation details not available]\n   \\textbf{Year:} 2005\n   \\textbf{Institution:} Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence (ARCHE), Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta\n\nNote: While my search indicates ARCHE conducted comprehensive searches in 17 electronic bibliographic databases through September 2005, the complete publication list for 2005 is not readily available in public sources.

Moritz and Juan Carlos Ayus\n- Journal: Pediatric Nephrology\n- Year: 2005\n- Volume: 20, Issue 12\n- Pages: 1687-1700\n- DOI: 10.1007\/s00467-005-1933-6\n- PubMed ID: 16079988\n\n**Institutional Affiliations:**\n- Michael L. Moritz: Division of Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles (based on later publications)\n- Juan Carlos Ayus: Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California (based on later affiliations and institutional connections)\n\n**Key Findings:**\n1. The paper reports on over 50 patients who suffered death or neurological injury from hospital-acquired hyponatremia\n2. The main factor contributing to hyponatremic encephalopathy in children is the routine use of hypotonic fluids in patients with impaired ability to excrete free water\n3. The authors advocate for using 0.9% sodium chloride in parenteral fluids to prevent most cases of hospital-acquired hyponatremic encephalopathy\n4. They report on 15 prospective studies in over 500 surgical patients showing that normal saline effectively prevents postoperative hyponatremia\n5. The paper emphasizes that hyponatremic encephalopathy should be treated with hypertonic saline and never with fluid restriction alone\n6. The authors also discuss prevention of hypernatremia, particularly in breastfed infants\n\nThis publication appears to be Dr. Ayus's major contribution to the field of pediatric dysnatremia in 2005, focusing on prevention strategies and treatment approaches for these potentially life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n=== SUB-TASK 3: Search for Canadian electrolyte solution guidelines 2005 ===\n\\text{No specific Canadian electrolyte solution guidelines from 2005 were found in the search results.}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n=== SUB-TASK 4: Search for pediatric sodium chloride guidelines Canadian journal ===\n## Detailed Findings: Pediatric Sodium Chloride Guidelines in Canadian Journals\n\n### 1. **Canadian Paediatric Society Practice Point (2018, updated 2024)**\n\n**Publication Title:** \"Risk of acute hyponatremia in hospitalized children and youth\"\n\n**Authors:**\n- Principal Author: **Jeremy N Friedman, MD**\n- Updated by: **Jonathan Sniderman, MD**, **Melani Buba, MD**, **Kevin Chan, MD**\n\n**Institutional Affiliation:** Canadian Paediatric Society, Acute Care Committee\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n- Isotonic fluids (D5W Plasmalyte, D5W Ringer's lactate, or D5W 0.9% NS) should be standard maintenance IV fluids for children 1 month to 18 years\n- Hypotonic IV fluids should NOT be used for routine maintenance requirements\n- Avoid hypotonic solutions when sodium is in low normal range (135-137 mmol\/L)\n\n### 2. **Survey Study on Canadian Paediatric Residents' Practices**\n\n**Publication Title:** \"Choice of maintenance intravenous fluids among paediatric residents: A survey of Canadian pediatric residents\"\n\n**Authors:** Multiple authors from Canadian pediatric institutions\n\n**Institutional Affiliation:** Canadian pediatric residency programs (17 programs across Canada)\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Survey of 147 pediatric residents (22% response rate)\n- **>75% of residents selected isotonic solutions** for infants and children across all clinical scenarios\n- Very hypotonic solutions (0.2% NaCl, 0.3% NaCl) were rarely chosen (<10% of cases)\n- Geographic variation noted in neonatal fluid choices\n- Indicates significant practice change in response to CPS guidelines\n\n### 3. **ISMP Canada \/ Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy Article**\n\n**Publication Title:** \"Hospital-Acquired Acute Hyponatremia and Parenteral Fluid Administration in Children\"\n\n**Authors:**\n- **Christine Koczmara, RN, BSc** (Senior Analyst, ISMP Canada)\n- **Sylvia Hyland, RPh, BScPhm, MHSc** (Vice-President and COO, ISMP Canada)\n- **Julie Greenall, RPh, BScPhm, MHSc, FISMPC** (Project Leader, ISMP Canada)\n\n**Institutional Affiliation:** Institute for Safe Medication Practices Canada (Toronto, Ontario)\n\n**Journal:** Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy (CJHP) 2009;62(6):512-514\n\n**Key Safety Recommendations:**\n- Two pediatric deaths reported due to acute hyponatremia from hypotonic IV fluids\n- Advocates for isotonic saline use in children during surgery and moderate-severe hypovolemia\n- Urges pharmacists to advocate for and review institutional fluid guidelines\n- Emphasizes monitoring of parenteral fluid and electrolyte administration\n\n### 4. **Provincial Guidelines and Clinical Resources**\n\n**British Columbia Children's Hospital:**\n- \"Fluid Management in Hospitalized Children: Preventing Iatrogenic Hyponatremia\" (2013)\n- Recommends 0.9% NaCl or Ringer's lactate as initial replacement fluid\n- Standardized maintenance protocols for pediatric patients\n\n**Ontario Coroner's Guidelines:**\n- Based on review of 6 pediatric deaths related to acute hyponatremia over 10 years\n- Comprehensive guidelines for parenteral fluid administration to children\n\n### **Summary of Canadian Consensus:**\n\n1. **Primary Recommendation:** Isotonic maintenance fluids (0.9% NaCl, balanced solutions) for children 1 month-18 years\n2. **Avoid Hypotonic Solutions:** Especially in children with normal\/low-normal sodium (135-137 mmol\/L)\n3. **Age-Specific Considerations:** Neonatal care requires specialized protocols due to unique physiology\n4. **Safety Focus:** Prevention of iatrogenic hyponatremia and associated neurological injury\/death\n5. **Institutional Requirements:** Clear policies and monitoring protocols for fluid therapy\n\nThese Canadian guidelines reflect a significant shift away from traditional hypotonic maintenance fluids toward isotonic solutions, driven by evidence of reduced hyponatremia risk without increased adverse effects.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n=== SUB-TASK 5: Search for Juan Ayus systematic reviews ===\n\n\\textbf{Correction Rates and Clinical Outcomes in Hospitalized Adults With Severe Hyponatremia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis} \\\\\n\\textbf{Authors:} Juan Carlos Ayus, MD; Michael L.

publication featured in a prominent British medical journal. This work emerged from collaborations including researchers based at a Canadian centre dedicated to child health evidence in Alberta, one of whom would later focus significantly on metadata and information science.

Coalition Against Mindaugas (1249-1251)\n**Key figures involved:**\n- **Tautvilas and Edivydas**: Mindaugas's nephews, sons of his brother Dausprungas\n- **Vykintas**: Duke of Samogitia (western Lithuania)\n- **Daniel of Galicia**: Brother-in-law to Tautvilas and Edivydas\n- **Vasilko of Volhynia**: Allied with the coalition\n\n**Events:**\n- In 1249, Mindaugas sought to seize his nephews' and Vykintas's lands, sparking internal war\n- The coalition gained control of Black Ruthenia, disrupting Mindaugas's son Vai\u0161vilkas's rule\n- Tautvilas traveled to Riga and was baptized by the Archbishop to strengthen his position\n- In 1250, the Livonian Order organized major raids into Mindaugas's territories\n\n### 2. The Voruta Castle Attack (1251)\n- Tautvilas and his allies attacked Mindaugas in Voruta Castle (location still debated)\n- The attack failed, forcing Tautvilas to retreat to Tverai Castle in Samogitia\n- Vykintas died around 1251-1252, weakening the coalition\n- Tautvilas was forced to rejoin Daniel of Galicia\n\n### 3. External Pressures and Alliances\n- **Livonian Order**: Initially allied with Mindaugas against the coalition but later became adversaries\n- **Samogitians**: Strongly resisted Mindaugas's rule and the Christian alliance\n- **Mongol Empire**: Challenged Mindaugas's gains in the southeast\n\n### 4. Final Dynastic Conflict and Assassination (1263)\n**Key figures in Mindaugas's death:**\n- **Treniota**: Mindaugas's nephew who led Samogitian resistance\n- **Daumantas**: Duke of Pskov who joined the conspiracy\n\n**Events:**\n- Mindaugas broke peace with the Livonian Order in 1261\n- Encouraged by Treniota, Mindaugas may have reverted to paganism\n- After Mindaugas expressed desire to marry Daumantas's wife (following Morta's death), Daumantas and Treniota assassinated Mindaugas and two of his sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, in 1263\n- This led to a period of instability where seven Grand Dukes held power in the next 32 years\n\n## Aftermath\n- **Successors**: Treniota took power but was assassinated in 1264\n- **Restoration**: Mindaugas's son Vai\u0161vilkas and brother-in-law \u0160varnas briefly restored order\n- **Traidenis**: Established stable rule around 1270, ending the dynastic turmoil\n\nThe dynastic challenges reveal that Mindaugas's unification faced significant internal resistance from his own family members and regional leaders, requiring strategic marriages, military conquests, and political alliances to maintain power.\n--------------------------------------------------\nTask 2: Find robotics competition participant who died in fire incident\nResult: No documented case found of a robotics competition participant who died in a fire incident. The most prominent robotics-related death was that of a Lake Orion High School student at the 2024 FIRST Championship in Houston, but this was determined to be a suicide, not a fire-related accident.\n--------------------------------------------------\nTask 3: Get cast details of The Flight of the Phoenix (1965)\nResult: Based on my research, here are the detailed cast facts for *The Flight of the Phoenix* (1965):\n\n## Leading Cast:\n- **James Stewart** as Frank Towns - The pilot and de facto leader of the group, a bitter and fatalistic aviator\n- **Richard Attenborough** as Lew Moran - The navigator who tries to maintain peace between characters\n- **Peter Finch** as Captain Harris - British Army captain who attempts to find an oasis\n- **Hardy Kr\u00fcger** as Heinrich Dorfmann - German aeronautical engineer who proposes building a new plane from wreckage\n- **Ernest Borgnine** as Trucker Cobb - Oil company foreman suffering from mental fatigue who dies of exposure\n\n## Supporting Cast:\n- **Ian Bannen** as \"Ratbags\" Crow - A cocky Scottish oil worker (Academy Award nominated for Best Supporting Actor)\n- **Ronald Fraser** as Sergeant Watson - British Army sergeant who feigns injury to stay behind\n- **Christian Marquand** as Dr. Renaud - French physician who helps sway Towns' opinion\n- **Dan Duryea** as Standish - Oil company accountant who names the rebuilt aircraft \"Phoenix\"\n- **George Kennedy** as Bellamy - Oil worker who cares for Carlos's pet monkey\n- **Gabriele Tinti** as Gabriele - Oil worker whose leg is severely injured and later dies by suicide\n- **Alex Montoya** as Carlos - Oil worker with a pet monkey\n- **Peter Bravos** as Tasso - Supporting oil worker\n- **William Aldrich** as Bill - Supporting character\n- **Barrie Chase** as Farida - Female character in the film\n\n## Key Facts:\n- The ensemble cast was praised by critics, particularly for the interactions between the characters\n- Ian Bannen received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor\n- Hardy Kr\u00fcger was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor\n- The film was noted for its \"stellar cast\" and strong ensemble performances\n- Several cast members had significant character arcs: Cobb's death, Dorfmann's engineering expertise, and the personality conflicts between Towns and Dorfmann\n\nThe supporting cast provided crucial character dynamics and plot development, with notable performances from Ian Bannen as the Scottish oil worker \"Ratbags\" Crow and Ronald Fraser as the conflicted British Army sergeant.\n--------------------------------------------------\nTask 4: Find which robotics competition might connect to Baltic duchy theme\nResult: Based on my search, I found several robotics competitions that connect to Baltic themes, with the most relevant being the **Baltic Robot Battle Competition**.\n\n## Baltic Robot Battle Competition\n\n**Organizer**: Robotics Association SKALP based in Gda\u0144sk, Poland\n**Location**: Baltic region (Poland, with participation from other Baltic countries)\n**Recent Event**: September 25-27, 2020\n\n**Key Details**:\n- The competition featured multiple categories including a RoboHackathon\n- Teams participated from various Baltic countries including Poland\n- The 2020 competition was held online due to the pandemic\n- Teams competed to create robots that could autonomously draw \"BBR 2020\" (Baltic Robot Battle 2020)\n- Prize categories included Miss BBR and various robot battle divisions\n\n**Notable Teams**:\n- **Melsoniaki Team** from the Faculty of Power and Aeronautical Engineering won first prize in the RoboHackathon with their BoBeR robot\n- **Wisienka** robot won the Miss BBR 2020 title\n- Other participating teams included creative entries using whipped cream, glowing cucumbers, and mobile robots with markers\n\n## Robotbattle in Tartu, Estonia\n\n**Location**: Tartu, Estonia (Baltic country)\n**Frequency**: Annual (8th edition mentioned)\n**Scale**: Over 2,300 spectators, nearly 300 engineering enthusiasts\n\n**Categories**:\n- Student category (Friday)\n- Seasoned robotics enthusiasts (Saturday)\n- Lightweight and heavyweight divisions\n\n**Prize Structure**: Winners received 1,500 euros in prize money plus trophies\n\n**Organizer**: AHHAA Science Centre\n\n## Connection to Baltic Theme\n\nThe **Baltic Robot Battle Competition** is the most directly connected to Baltic themes as:\n1.

{"example_id":27,"prompt":[{"content":"Consider a specific composer's early 1960s arrangement of a country's traditional song, an arrangement written for a specific cultural event and later played at the opening of important performance spaces. One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment.

This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation.

He grew up in poverty on Manhattan\\'s Lower East Side, with his sickly health attributed to the family\\'s impoverished conditions. Early in life, he worked various jobs including junior architect, copy boy for the New York Sun, book custodian at the New York Public Library, bellhop, draughtsman, and night doorkeeper, giving all his earnings to his family.\\n\\nCagney began his career in vaudeville and Broadway before transitioning to Hollywood. He rose to fame playing tough guy roles in films like *The Public Enemy* (1931), *Taxi!* (1932), and *Angels with Dirty Faces* (1938). He won an Academy Award for *Yankee Doodle Dandy* (1942) and was known for his distinctive vocal style and energetic performances.\\n\\n## Economic Slumps\/Financial Downturn Terminology References\\n\\nWhile Cagney\\'s biography doesn\\'t contain extensive direct mention of \"economic slumps\" or \"financial downturn\" terminology, there are several connections to the Great Depression era:\\n\\n1. **Great Depression Success**: According to a CNN\/Mental Floss article, Cagney thrived during the Great Depression period, going from a $500-a-week contract player in 1930 to becoming one of Hollywood\\'s top ten moneymakers by 1935. In 1933, he was making the equivalent of $40,000 per week.\\n\\n2. **Warner Bros. Financial Context**: The Wikipedia article mentions that Warner Bros. experienced \"financial meltdown in 1931\u20132 as movie ticket [sales] fell\" during the Depression, which coincided with Cagney\\'s early career with the studio.\\n\\n3. **Cultural Context**: The Britannica article on the Great Depression\\'s popular culture mentions that Warner Bros. specialized in gangster films about \"the violence and poverty of slum life,\" which were relevant to Depression-era audiences. Cagney was specifically noted as one of the gangster actors whose characters lived in a world far removed from ordinary Americans\\' economic struggles.\\n\\n4. **Career Timing**: Much of Cagney\\'s early breakthrough work occurred during the height of the Great Depression (1930-1939), making his career success particularly notable during this economically challenging period.\\n\\nThe terminology around economic hardship is more implicit than explicit in Cagney\\'s biography, but his career trajectory clearly shows how he flourished professionally during one of America\\'s worst economic downturns.', '\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{LankaBangla Securities Limited} - Subsidiary of LankaBangla Finance PLC\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{SIBL Securities Limited} - Wholly owned subsidiary of Social Islami Bank Ltd.\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{Citizen Securities Limited} - Associated with larger financial institutions\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{BRAC EPL Stock Brokerage} - Part of the BRAC financial ecosystem\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{NRBC Securities Limited (NBLSL)} - Connected to NRBC Bank\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n', '\\\\text{Motijheel C\/A, Dhaka - specifically Stock Exchange Building, 9\/F}', '\\\\text{Algorithmic trading in Bangladeshi brokerage firms is increasingly dependent on API integration, high-speed data communication infrastructure, and cloud-based technologies.

Indigenous communities displaced to artistic settlements:\nBalgo Hills (Wirrimanu) is an example of an Indigenous community in Australia that was displaced to a settlement (originally established as a mission in 1937) and developed a unique artistic style. The community brought together people from eight different language groups who had been displaced from their traditional lands. Despite these disruptions, Balgo artists created a distinctive characterized by bold colors, intricate patterns, and symbolic motifs representing Dreaming stories. This style is described as \"uniquely Aboriginal, distinct in the Balgo style\" and has gained international recognition. Other examples include Mount Margaret Mission where the \"women of the raffia room\" developed distinctive stenciled and pokerwork plywood plaques from the 1930s onward.\n\n4. Australian indigenous language phylum and riverine areas:\nAustralian Aboriginal languages represent one of the most complex linguistic landscapes globally, with approximately 250-400 languages classified into numerous families and isolates. The primary linguistic phyla are:\n\n**Main Classification:**\n- **Pama-Nyungan family**: The largest and most widespread, covering most of Australia (about 270 languages)\n- **Non-Pama-Nyungan languages**: Smaller families and isolates spoken primarily in northern Australia\n\n**Key Linguistic Families:**\n1. **Pama-Nyungan** (majority of languages)\n2. **Gunwinyguan** (Arnhem Land)\n3. **Mirndi** (Northern Territory)\n4. **Tangkic** (Gulf of Carpentaria)\n5. **Garawan** (Lake Eyre basin)\n6. **Several isolates and smaller families**\n\n**Riverine\/Coastal Distribution:**\n- Riverine communities were often associated with specific language families like **Gunwinyguan** languages in Arnhem Land's river systems\n- Coastal areas featured diverse languages including **Tangkic** in the Gulf of Carpentaria and various Pama-Nyungan coastal languages\n\n**Displacement Impact:**\n- Colonial displacement led to language extinction, with many riverine and coastal languages lost\n- Surviving languages are primarily in remote areas, with only 13 still acquired by children\n- Revival efforts focus on reconstructing languages from historical records\n\nThe linguistic diversity reflects Australia's ancient settlement history, with languages developed over 50,000 years across varied riverine and coastal environments before European displacement disrupted transmission.\n[Execution time: 51.30s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_3c7575017cc6461ab0038b75\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Based on the search results, I'm getting clearer information.

Martu people and their ethnolinguistic federation:\n\\text{The Martu people are an ethnolinguistic federation whose languages belong to the Wati group within the larger Pama-Nyungan language family, representing multiple related groups sharing cultural identity while maintaining distinct linguistic characteristics.}\n\n2. Balgo Hills Indigenous community and artistic style:\n\\text{Balgo Hills (Wirrimanu) is an Indigenous settlement in Western Australia featuring eight language groups (Kukatja, Ngardi, Djaru, Warlpiri, Walmajarri, Wangkajunga, Pintupi, Ngaatjatjarra) known for its distinctive vibrant desert art style characterized by bold colors, geometric patterns, and cultural abstraction representing Country itself.}\n\n3. Martu people displacement and riverine connections:\nBased on the search results and webpage content, here's the information about the Martu people and their language:\n\n## Martu People Displacement\nThe Martu people experienced significant displacement, particularly during the 20th century:\n\n- **Canning Stock Route (1906-07)**: Many Martu were forced to serve as guides and reveal water sources after being run down by men on horseback, restrained by heavy chains and tied to trees\n- **Mission settlements**: Starting with the establishment of settlements like Jigalong, many Martu were moved or taken from the desert to these settlements where missionaries encouraged them to stop foraging\n- **Last first contact**: In 1964, the last major first contact event in Australian history occurred when a small clan of 20 Martu women and children was discovered by patrol officers in the Percival Lakes area after having avoided European contact\n- **Modern settlements**: Today most Martu reside in communities at Punmu, Kunawaritji, and Parnngurr, though they maintain access to traditional lands\n\n## Language Phylum\nThe Martu languages belong to:\n- **Pama-Nyungan language family** - the largest group of indigenous languages spread over much of the Australian continent\n- **Wati subgroup** - within the Pama-Nyungan family\n- **Martu Wangka** - collectively called \"Martu Speak,\" this is a recent amalgamation of several dialects including Kartujarra, Manyjilyjarra, Warnman, and Nyangajarra\n\nThe Martu traditional lands are in the Great Sandy Desert within the Pilbara region of Western Australia, not specifically riverine areas. The displacement was primarily due to European contact and establishment of settlements, rather than riverine environmental changes.\n\n4. Other indigenous groups in Balgo Hills:\nBalgo Hills Aboriginal artists developed a distinctive artistic style characterized by:\n\n**Key Style Characteristics:**\n- **Vivid, bold color palette** - among the first desert artists to embrace intense colors like bright reds, yellows, and oranges, moving from earlier earthy tones\n- **Geometric patterns and abstract designs** - representing ancestral landscapes, sandhills (tali), and waterholes (tjurnu)\n- **Spiritual connection** - deeply rooted in Tjukurrpa (Dreaming stories) with a quality of \"groundedness\" known as marrka\n- **Map-making tradition** - creating visual maps of sacred landscapes and significant cultural sites\n\n**Cultural Context & Resettlement:**\nBalgo Hills (Wirrimanu) was established as a Catholic mission in the 1930s, becoming a gathering point for displaced desert tribes from **nine different language groups**, including:\n- Kukatja\n- Walmajarri  \n- Pintupi\n- Warlpiri\n- Ngardi\n- Wangkatjungka\n\nThis unique resettlement created a vibrant cultural blend where artists from diverse backgrounds came together, contributing to the distinctive Balgo style that emerged in the 1980s when acrylic paint was introduced.\n\n**Notable Artists:**\n- Eubena Nampitjin (1921-2013) - renowned for vibrant waterhole depictions\n- Helicopter Tjungarrayi - distinctive linear style representing desert terrain\n- Millie Skeen Nampitjin - pioneering women's artist\n- Multiple generations of family artists maintaining traditional connections\n\nThe Balgo style contrasts with other Indigenous art movements like Papunya Tula, offering a more colorful, experimental approach while maintaining deep cultural significance through the representation of country and Dreaming stories.\n[Execution time: 32.65s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_2f627f592ba14a9498a39eff\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{}\", \"name\": \"call_python_re artistic settlement.

This study, originating from a Swedish university hospital's neuroscience institute in Gothenburg, investigated how virtual environments could serve as a tool for neuropsychological *assessment*. Specifically, it focused on a visual deficit often following right-hemisphere strokes, analyzing search patterns and movement *kinematics* within a VR task.\n\nOne of the key researchers involved had previously published (around 2004 and continuing through 2007-2008) on using VR, sometimes combined with *haptics*, for upper extremity *rehabilitation* after stroke, often collaborating with colleagues specializing in medical informatics and rehabilitation medicine from the same prominent Gothenburg academy.

According to Victor Friedman's research, the gospel represents a key phenomenon in the historical development of modern Macedonian national identity, with language being the most important element of that identity.\\n\\nKey points about the Konikovo Gospel and its relationship to Macedonian identity:\\n\\n1. **Historical Context**: The gospel was created in the late 18th or early 19th century in what is now Greek Macedonia during Ottoman rule. At that time, Ottoman citizens were identified by religious millet (Muslim, Greek Orthodox, Jewish, Armenian), but there was growing awareness that language could be a basis for identity.\\n\\n2. **Linguistic Significance**: The manuscript is bilingual (Greek and Macedonian) and represents one of the earliest written records of the Macedonian vernacular language. It used the Greek alphabet to write the Macedonian language, making it the earliest known text to use colloquial Macedonian as a written language.\\n\\n3. **Identity Formation**: The gospel contributed to Macedonian identity in several ways:\\n   - It provided religious texts in the vernacular language spoken by the congregation\\n   - It represented resistance against Greek ecclesiastical policies aimed at Hellenization\\n   - It helped create awareness of language as a distinct identity marker separate from religion\\n   - Pavel Bo\u017eigropski's later corrections (1852) attempted to create a linguistic koine, foreshadowing later standardization efforts\\n\\n4. **Dialectal Features**: The text is written in an Aegean Macedonian dialect, specifically from the Voden-Enidzhevardar region, which belongs to the Eastern Macedonian dialect group.\\n\\n5. **Political Resistance**: The gospel represents an act of resistance against centuries of Greek policies opposing Slavic literacy, including Byzantine destruction of Slavic manuscripts and later Greek government efforts to create linguistic homogeneity.\\n\\nThe document demonstrates that while modern Macedonian national identity developed over time, the foundations were being laid in the late 18th and early 19th centuries through linguistic and religious texts like the Konikovo Gospel.\", '\\\\text{The Konikovo Gospel does not contain a traditional foreword with self-identification.

It was written in the Voden-Enidzhevardar dialect (Aegean Macedonian) using the Greek alphabet.\\n\\n**Identity Formation**: According to scholar Victor Friedman, the Konikovo Gospel \"is a document of tremendous significance in the development of modern Macedonian identity as we understand it today.\" It represents a conscious effort to preserve the Macedonian language against Greek ecclesiastical policies aimed at Hellenization.\\n\\n**Historical Context**: Created during a period when Ottoman Christians were identified by religious community (millet) rather than ethnicity, the gospel reflects the emerging awareness that language, not just religion, served as a foundation for national identity among Macedonians.\\n\\n**Resistance Symbol**: The document is seen as evidence of resistance against Byzantine and later Greek policies that sought to eradicate Slavic literacy and linguistic distinctiveness in the region.\\n\\nThe gospel predates other significant Macedonian linguistic works like Danail\\'s Lexicon Tetragloson (1802) and represents a crucial moment in the codification and preservation of Macedonian linguistic identity during a challenging historical period.', 'The Konikovo Gospel, written in the late 18th or early 19th century, contains ethnic terminology that reflects the complex linguistic and identity landscape of that era. Based on the search results and analysis:\\n\\n**Key ethnic terms used:**\\n\\n1. **\"Bogarski\"** - This was the term used by Pavel Bo\u017eigropski in the 1852 published version of the Konikovo Gospel to describe the Macedonian language. The term literally relates to \"Bulgarian\" but was used in a broader sense to refer to South Slavic vernacular languages.\\n\\n2. **\"Slavjanobugarski\"** - A term meaning \"Slavo-Bulgarian,\" which was commonly used in the 18th-19th centuries to describe the vernacular Slavic languages of the region, including what is now recognized as Macedonian.\\n\\n3. **\"Makedonski\"** - While the original author\\'s specific terminology is unknown, the dialect used is clearly identifiable as what we would now call Macedonian. Contemporary speakers referred to their language as \"Makedonski\" (Macedonian), and this term was documented in ethnographic accounts from the period.\\n\\n**Historical context:**\\n- The Gospel was written during the Ottoman period when identity was primarily religious (millet system), but linguistic awareness was growing\\n- The term \"bogarski\" reflected the common 19th-century usage where \"Bulgarian\" was often used broadly for South Slavic vernaculars\\n- The manuscript represents an early attempt to write the Macedonian folk language in Greek script, resisting the dominance of Church Slavonic\\n- It shows awareness of language as an identity marker separate from religion, particularly in the context of Greek Hellenization policies\\n\\nThe Konikovo Gospel thus preserves important evidence of how Macedonian speakers identified their language in centuries past, using terms like \"bogarski\" and \"slavjanobugarski\" before the modern standardization of Macedonian as a distinct language.', '\\\\text{Konikovo Gospel}', 'Bosniaks']\n[Execution time: 31.97s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Now I have the key information!

with a hotel in an archipelagic Southeast Asian nation, its architecture inspired by seafaring vessels, operated by a luxury hotel group. This group, named after the founder of its parent hospitality corporation, was later surpassed in prestige by another upscale brand. An iconic establishment of this succeeding brand, located in a major Eastern U.S. urban center, was sold to an Asian insurer. This insurer, which acquired said establishment from a large global investment firm, had its chairman face legal proceedings. That chairman was subsequently imprisoned for financial crimes. The aforementioned investment firm, from which the insurer made its acquisition, also purchased the U.S. arm of an Australian real estate entity, later renaming it.

{"example_id":47,"prompt":[{"content":"A mid-19th-century naval vessel, later bearing a name of Teutonic origin associated with a mythological fire deity, was key in the first combat use of a specific type of aerial weapon carrier. This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city.

Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's.

This entity established a subsidiary specializing in solar electricity, a field rapidly advancing in a major South Asian nation which notably utilizes building summits for energy capture. These summit-based energy installations are photovoltaic systems that often channel surplus electricity into the broader power grid. A critical electronic device in these grid-integrated setups is responsible for converting the panel's direct current output into alternating current. On a much larger scale, similar current conversion technology is employed in systems designed for bulk power transmission over extensive distances using direct current at very high potentials. Such long-distance systems, which operate with this non-alternating current to reduce energy loss, may, in certain configurations (especially those with a single main conductor), use a specific type of conductor to link to an earth grounding point.

The researchers conducted 50 programming\/one-way effect cycles to determine how often programming can be repeated, how repeated programming affects the one-way effect, and the accumulation of irreversible strain. They found that programming, cooling, unloading, and heating to trigger the one-way effect causes an increase in irreversible strain and a corresponding decrease in the intensity of the one-way effect, particularly during the first thermomechanical cycles.']\n[Execution time: 12.07s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_1745c98b359643feb1917886\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Let me verify that Gunther Eggeler worked on NiTi alloys and superalloys as mentioned in the original question\\\\nresult = llm_batch([\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Gunther Eggeler NiTi powder metallurgy superalloy microstructure Germany\\\\\\\"\\\\n])\\\\nprint(result)\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 1 call(s) in 27.82s\n  [0]: 14360 tokens, 5 tool calls, 27.82s \u26a0 max turns\n['Gunther Eggeler is a professor at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany who researches NiTi shape memory alloys, including powder metallurgy processing and microstructure analysis.']\n[Execution time: 28.03s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_1ce9b4df247d4a5db0e7414b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Let me also verify that this is indeed about a commercial amorphous polymer and confirm all the details match\\\\nresult = llm_batch([\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Tecoflex amorphous shape memory polymer commercial commercial polymer\\\\\\\"\\\\n])\\\\nprint(result)\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 1 call(s) in 30.17s\n  [0]: 12807 tokens, 4 tool calls, 30.16s \u2713\n['\\\\text{Tecoflex EG-72D is a commercially available amorphous shape memory polymer primarily used in medical devices including catheters, tubing, balloons, wound care products, and implantable devices.}']\n[Execution time: 30.41s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_b1c879957f2e4609a6cba614\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Now I have all the information needed to provide the final answer.

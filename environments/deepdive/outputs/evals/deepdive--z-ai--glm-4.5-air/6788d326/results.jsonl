several relevant academic papers from the 2010s that address wildfire risk, federal forests, stakeholder perspectives, narratives, and collaborative approaches:\n\n## Key Academic Papers Found:\n\n**1. \"Stakeholder Understandings of Wildfire Mitigation: A Case of Shared and Contested Meanings\"** (Champ et al., 2012)\n- *Journal:* Environmental Management\n- *Method:* Key informant interviews and focus groups with stakeholders in Colorado's Front Range\n- *Focus:* Compared meanings of wildfire risk mitigation between partnership members (\"producers\") and external stakeholders (\"consumers\")\n- *Key finding:* Significant differences between scientific management discourse (producers) and community discourse (consumers)\n\n**2. \"Agency Engagement with Stakeholder Collaborations, in Wildfire Policy and Beyond\"** (Bradshaw, 2019)\n- *Journal:* Arizona State Law Journal  \n- *Method:* Longitudinal research with dozens of interviews and case studies\n- *Focus:* Federal agency engagement with local stakeholder collaborations, including the 4 Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI)\n- *Key finding:* Stakeholder collaborations are widespread and vital for agency decision-making on complex issues like wildfire risk\n\n**3. \"Wildfire narratives: Identifying and characterizing multiple...\"** (recent work)\n- *Journal:* ScienceDirect publication\n- *Focus:* Identified nine distinct social narratives about wildfire causes, consequences, and solutions\n- *Method:* Analysis of how different actors construct wildfire narratives\n\n**4. \"Variable Support and Opposition to Fuels Treatments for Wildfire...\"** (Journal of Forestry)\n- *Journal:* Journal of Forestry (major forestry journal)\n- *Method:* In-depth interviews exploring support\/opposition to fuels-reduction projects\n- *Focus:* Understanding why stakeholders vary in their acceptance of wildfire treatments\n\n## Research Themes Identified:\n\nThe papers demonstrate several key themes in wildfire research from the 2010s:\n\n1. **Stakeholder Diversity:** Different stakeholder groups (agencies, communities, environmental groups) construct wildfire risk and mitigation differently\n2. **Communication Challenges:** Failure to recognize differing framings can hamper collaborative efforts\n3. **Narrative Construction:** Wildfire issues are understood through competing social narratives\n4. **Collaborative Governance:** Stakeholder collaborations are increasingly important but complex\n5. **Trust and Acceptance:** Public acceptance of management strategies depends on trust and communication approaches\n\nThe research shows that wildfire management is not just a technical problem but a social communication challenge requiring understanding of different stakeholder perspectives and narrative frameworks.\n[Execution time: 28.70s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_b99497d10795401f8dab20e6\",

narratives, accepted truths, and roadblocks related to biomass. Here are the most relevant findings:\n\n## Key Academic Papers:\n\n### 1. **\"Conventional Wisdoms of Woody Biomass Utilization on Federal Public Lands\"** (Becker et al., 2011)\n- **Focus**: Examines persistent \"conventional wisdoms\" (accepted truths) about what hinders biomass use on federal lands\n- **Key Findings**: \n  - Supply guarantees, industry presence, transportation, and biomass value are major limiting factors\n  - Agency budgets, staffing, environmental concerns, and partnerships are more problematic than impeding progress\n  - These \"accepted truths\" vary in impact depending on local conditions and their interconnectedness\n\n### 2. **\"Forest Biomass Policies and Regulations in the United States of America\"** (Page-Dumroese et al., 2022)\n- **Focus**: Comprehensive review of U.S. policies, regulations, and directives affecting forest biomass use\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Harmonizing definitions of biomass terms across different programs could increase utilization\n  - Policy coordination at different government levels is needed to support biomass supply chains\n  - Renewable Fuel Standard definitions create barriers for forest biomass utilization\n\n### 3. **\"Seeing Forests as Fuel\"** (Mittlefehldt, 2016)\n- **Focus**: Historical analysis of arguments for and against using forests for fuel since the 1970s energy crises\n- **Key Findings**: Explores how narratives about forest biomass have evolved and contested \"accepted truths\" over time\n\n## Common Themes and Roadblocks:\n\n### **Accepted Truths\/Narratives:**\n1. **Supply Guarantee Myth**: Belief that guaranteed supply is needed before industry investment\n2. **Economic Viability Concerns**: Perceptions that biomass operations are economically unfeasible\n3. **Environmental Trade-offs**: Belief that biomass utilization conflicts with forest health and biodiversity\n4. **Policy Ineffectiveness**: Views that existing policies fail to adequately support biomass development\n\n### **Major Roadblocks:**\n- **Supply Inconsistency**: Federal land management creates unpredictable biomass availability\n- **Transportation Costs**: High costs for moving biomass from remote forest areas\n- **Market Development**: Limited infrastructure and markets for biomass products\n- **Regulatory Complexity**: Multiple overlapping policies and regulations create compliance challenges\n- **Scale Issues**: Small, inconsistent volumes make large-scale investments risky\n\n### **Policy Implications:**\n- Need for better coordination between federal agencies and levels of government\n- Importance of standardizing biomass definitions across programs\n- Value of developing regional biomass utilization strategies\n- Recognition of the interconnection between supply, infrastructure, and policy barriers\n\nThese papers reveal that while biomass utilization on federal forests is often framed as having straightforward technical solutions, the reality is complex, with social, economic, and institutional factors creating persistent roadblocks that require nuanced policy approaches rather than technological fixes alone.\n[Execution time: 96.68s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_c7ce7c655711426da51a07ec\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Great!

However, uncertainty exists regarding the factors necessary to stimulate use. We draw on in-depth interviews with local industry, agency, community, and tribal representatives from 10 study sites on federal public lands across the United States to examine persistent conventional wisdoms about what hinders biomass use. Findings indicate that the conventional wisdoms were reasonably accurate although the degree to which each impeded progress varied. Their interconnectedness also varied depending on local conditions.

Key colonial-era sections included:\n\n- **Section 295**: Injuring or defiling places of worship\n- **Section 295-A** (1927): Added for deliberate and malicious acts to outrage religious feelings\n- **Section 298**: Utterances wounding religious feelings\n- These laws had universal application, protecting religious sentiments of \"any class of persons\" and requiring proof of malicious intent\n\n## Major Amendments Under Zia-ul Haq (1980s)\n\nThe most significant changes occurred during General Zia-ul Haq's Islamization drive:\n\n### 1980-1986 Amendments\n- **Section 295-B** (1982): Criminalized defiling the Quran with **mandatory life imprisonment**\n- **Section 295-C** (1986): Made defiling the Prophet Muhammad's name punishable by **death or life imprisonment** (later amended in 1991 to make death penalty mandatory)\n- **Section 298-A** (1980): Criminalized derogatory remarks about revered Islamic figures\n\n### 1984 Anti-Ahmadiyya Laws\n- **Sections 298-B and 298-C**: Criminalized Ahmadiyya Muslims from:\n  - Calling themselves \"Muslims\"\n  - Using Islamic terminology (e.g., \"Masjid,\" \"Azan\")\n  - Practicing or propagating their faith\n  - Punishable by up to 3 years imprisonment\n\n## Constitutional Amendments\n\n- **1974**: Constitutional amendment declaring Ahmadiyya community as \"non-Muslims\"\n- **1985**: Eighth Constitutional Amendment placed religious laws outside judicial review\n\n## 1991 Enforcement of Shari'ah Act\n\nMade Islamic injunctions the \"supreme law of Pakistan\" while claiming protection for non-Muslims' personal laws.\n\n## Impact on Religious Minorities\n\nThese amendments have:\n- Enabled systematic discrimination against Ahmadis, Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, and other minorities\n- Led to increased violence, mob lynchings, and targeted killings\n- Created legal frameworks that facilitate forced conversions and religious persecution\n- Made blasphemy allegations common tools for personal vendettas\n\nThe laws have been widely condemned by human rights organizations for enabling abuse and creating a climate of religious intolerance in Pakistan.\n\nResult 3: Islamic State (IS) attacked the Sufi shrine

Attack Context:**\n- An angry mob attempted to attack the century-old Seetal Das Compound neighborhood in Karachi on Sunday evening\n- The compound is home to around 300 Hindu families and 30 Muslim families\n- The mob targeted the Hindu community and attempted to vandalize a temple inside the compound\n- Three pre-partition idols were destroyed during the attack\n\n**SHO Abdul Majid's Role:**\n- SHO (Station House Officer) Abdul Majid was the police official who responded to the attack\n- He stayed outside the compound's gate for 24 hours without any break to protect the residents\n- He provided continuous protection and reassured the Hindu community of their safety\n- He deployed over a dozen mobile police units in the area to provide safety\n- He confirmed the arrest of a man who was nominated in an FIR related to the incident\n- He assured that police were deployed at all three temples in his jurisdiction and that the situation was under control\n\n**Community Response:**\n- An elderly Hindu resident credited SHO Abdul Majid as \"a savior sent by Bhagwan\"\n- The Muslim community also played a crucial role by standing with the Hindus to prevent the mob from entering\n- The police action helped some families return to their homes, though over 60 families had temporarily relocated due to fear\n\nSHO Abdul Majid's protection efforts were instrumental in preventing a more serious attack and providing security to the vulnerable Hindu community during the tense situation.\n\nResult 3: Muslim neighbors in Karachi courageously protected Hindu families from an attacking mob by forming a human wall at the compound gate, preventing violence during a temple vandalism incident on November 4, 2020.\n[Execution time:

This configuration was common in the early days of email (particularly around 1997-2003) because:\n\n1. **Default Configuration**: Most mail servers came configured as open relays by default\n2. **Reliability Concerns**: System administrators left them open to ensure legitimate email could always be sent even if the user's local server wasn't functioning\n3. **Initial Trust Environment**: Email abuse was rare in the early internet era\n\nThe problem arose when spammers discovered they could exploit open relays to send massive amounts of spam without being traced. The first major spammer, Cyber Promotions (Cyberpromo), pioneered this technique in 1997, and other spammers quickly followed, leading to:\n\n- Server overload from spam traffic\n- Legitimate emails being blocked due to blacklisting\n- System administrators spending\u5927\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4 cleaning up abused servers\n\nThis led to the creation of DNS-based blocklists and changes in MTA software defaults to use \"closed relays\" that only accept mail for their own users and only relay mail from authorized senders.\n\nQuestion 2: What email protocol verified a user's ability to receive mail before allowing them to send?\nAnswer: \n\nQuestion 3: What protocol superseded the previous protocol and standardized sender login for email?\nAnswer: SMTP AUTH\n\nQuestion 4: What is the User-Agent string for Safari on early 2010s iPad models?\nAnswer: \\text{Mozilla\/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 5\\_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit\/534.46 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version\/5.1 Mobile\/9A334 Safari\/7534.48.3}\n[Execution time: 81.31s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_6775ac2b66b14f30b127ee14\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# I notice question 2 wasn't answered clearly.

A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies. This particular power systems investigation involved synergistic efforts between academics from a prominent engineering institution in Nanjing and experts from electric power research entities in Zhejiang.","role":"user","tool_calls":null},{"content":"I'll help you identify this specific 2020 IET publication.

To comprehensively determine the risk level, an operational risk assessment method considering multiple risk factors is proposed.

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

However, I found important safety information regarding pediatric electrolyte solutions from UK regulatory sources:\n\nThe MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) issued a comprehensive safety assessment in 2012 that reviewed the evidence on hypotonic saline (0.18% saline\/4% glucose) solutions in children. This report referenced earlier safety concerns and guidelines from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the National Patient Safety Agency.\n\nKey safety guidelines from this assessment include:\n\n1. Hypotonic saline (0.18% saline\/4% glucose) solutions are contraindicated in children except in specialist settings (renal, cardiac, liver, high-dependency or intensive care units) under expert supervision\n\n2. These solutions should be removed from stock and general use in areas treating children\n\n3. Isotonic solutions (e.g., 0.9% saline) are preferred for maintenance fluids in most children\n\n4. Careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential when administering IV fluids to children\n\n5. Acute symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring prompt recognition and treatment\n\nThe assessment noted that there have been over 50 worldwide reports of permanent neurological injuries or deaths in children associated with iatrogenic hyponatremia from hypotonic IV fluids.\n\nWhile I couldn't locate the specific 2005 BMJ guideline, these safety principles regarding electrolyte solutions in pediatric patients have been well-established in the medical literature and reinforced by regulatory authorities\n---\nResult 4: 40 \\text{ mmol\/L potassium chloride should

The research called for more rigorous evaluation of safety interventions to move beyond expert consensus and anecdotal evidence.\n\nThe findings were particularly important given that potassium chloride errors had resulted in fatal incidents, including the two cases in Calgary, Alberta that prompted the original safety review\n---\nResult 2: \\text{Lisa Hartling provided methodological and administrative support for the Tubman et al.

The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger's causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n[Execution time:

Maltese composers studied in Naples and Palermo, with Nicol\u00f2 Isouard becoming prominent in Paris. Spanish guitar traditions deeply influenced Maltese folk music.\\n- **European Classical Tradition**: The Knights established Malta's first professional musical institutions, including the cappella di musica at St. John's Co-Cathedral, hiring Italian-trained musicians and introducing polyphony and opera to the island.\\n- **British Influence**: After 1800, British colonialism introduced European band traditions and brass music, which became integrated into Maltese village culture.\\n\\n**Maltese Influence on Continental Practices:**\\n- **Opera Introduction**: Malta was remarkably early in adopting opera - only 24 years after its invention in Florence (1597), Italian Knights brought opera performances to their auberge in 1621, earlier than many European cities.\\n- **Musical Talent Export**: Maltese composers like Nicol\u00f2 Isouard (1775-1818) achieved significant success in continental Europe, particularly in Paris, where his operas became part of the French operatic tradition.\\n- **Cultural Bridge**: Malta served as a Mediterranean crossroads, facilitating the exchange of musical ideas between European and North African traditions through trade and cultural contact.\\n\\n**Key Musical Characteristics:**\\n- Brass band tradition accompanying religious feasts and processions\\n- Folk poetry (g\u0127ana) with Siculo-Arabic influences\\n- Synthesis of Semitic linguistic roots with European musical structures\\n- Strong choral and sacred music traditions\\n\\nMalta's musical development demonstrates how an island nation can both absorb continental European musical practices while also contributing to and influencing European musical traditions through its unique geographical and cultural position as a Mediterranean crossroads.\"]\n[Execution time: 59.16s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_16b00ffc32364da6aae698e0\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{}\", \"name\": \"call_where did Antonio Micallef ultimately reside municipality Malta<\/arg_value>\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"'call_where did Antonio Micallef ultimately reside municipality Malta<\/arg_value>'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_3d822a9d77b5454085f57431\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"llm_batch([\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for Antonio Micallef Malta residence municipality where he lived\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for Antonio Micallef Gozo Malta final home address\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for Antonio Micallef composer Malta burial place last residence\\\\\\\"\\\\n])\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 3 call(s) in 21.35s\n  [0]: error (7.78s)\n  [1]: 12361 tokens, 5 tool calls, 21.35s \u26a0 max turns\n  [2]: 13755 tokens, 5 tool calls, 20.89s \u26a0 max turns\nOut[3]: [\"Error in sub-LLM call: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))\", '\\\\text{No publicly available final home address found for Antonio Micallef from Gozo, Malta}', '\\\\text{Burial place not definitively identified in available sources}']\n[Execution time: 73.97s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_7ebe12b6cd4241f6bc66b507\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"llm_batch([\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for 'Antonio Micallef' Malta composer musician wind instrumentalist trombone\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for Maltese wind instrumentalist composer emigrated left homeland\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for Malta notable musician composer exile abroad residence\\\\\\\"\\\\n])\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 3 call(s) in 20.69s\n  [0]: 6140 tokens, 2 tool calls, 18.78s \u2713\n  [1]: 14870 tokens, 5 tool calls, 20.62s \u26a0 max turns\n  [2]: 9853 tokens, 2 tool calls, 20.69s \u2713\nOut[4]: [\"Antonio Micallef (1867-1940) was a Maltese composer, musician, and wind instrumentalist who mastered piano, violin, and trombone.

range of fortifications built by the Knights Hospitaller (1530-1789), including major forts like St. Elmo, St. Angelo, St. Michael, Ricasoli, and the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines.\\n\\n### 19th Century Military Expansion\\n\\n**Technological Response:**\\n- By the mid-1800s, the British recognized that existing fortifications were vulnerable to new French technologies (shell-firing guns developed in 1837, rifled muzzle-loading cannon in 1842)\\n- The introduction of iron-clad warships (starting with France\\'s 1858 ironclad) necessitated defensive upgrades\\n\\n**New Fortifications (1860s-1870s):**\\n- 76 defensive works were constructed across Malta\\n- Major forts built at: Sliema (1872), St. Rocco (1873), St. Lucian (1874), Pembroke (1875), St. Leonardo (1875), Delimara (1876), and Tas-Silg (1879)\\n- Fort Pembroke was constructed specifically to protect the Grand Harbour\\n\\n**Counter to Italian Naval Threat:**\\n- Italian battleship Duilio and Dandolo (1873) armed with 100-ton guns spurred British response\\n- Rinella Battery (1879) and Cambridge Battery (1878) built with identical \"world\\'s largest cannon\" to counter Italian naval power\\n\\n### The Victoria Lines (1875-1899)\\n\\n**Construction:**\\n- Begun in 1875 along the Great Fault limestone ridge (12km from Fomm ir-Ri\u0127 to Ba\u0127ar i\u010b-\u010aag\u0127aq)\\n- Three key forts: Fort Madliena (east), Fort Bingemma (west), Fort Mosta (center)\\n- Completed in 1899 with connecting walls, gun loops, and fortified bridges\\n- Named in honor of Queen Victoria\\'s Diamond Jubilee (1897)\\n\\n**Defensive Purpose:**\\n- Protected northern approaches to Malta from land invasion\\n- Controlled water resources and strategic high ground\\n- Combined land and sea defensive capabilities\\n- Abandoned in 1907 after being deemed vulnerable in military exercises\\n\\n### Coastal Batteries System\\n\\n**Strategic Placement:**\\n- 11 coastal batteries recently classified by Planning Authority (Grade 1 and 2)\\n- Protected vital harbors and shipping lanes\\n- Built following Crimean War (1853-56) and Suez Canal opening (1869)\\n\\n**Notable Batteries:**\\n- Delle Grazie

island nation musical traditions have significantly influenced continental Latin American music, particularly through rhythmic patterns and percussion elements.

The influence is particularly evident in salsa and other Afro-Caribbean-derived styles that have spread throughout the Americas.']\n[Execution time: 78.03s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_2c56316f7a9742f8bf8124a9\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"llm_batch([\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for Caribbean wind instrumentalist composer emigrated left homeland\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for Puerto Rico Cuba notable wind instrumentalist composer abroad\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for Caribbean island musician composer exile residence municipality\\\\\\\"\\\\n])\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 3 call(s) in 32.53s\n  [0]: 11987 tokens, 5 tool calls, 18.88s \u26a0 max turns\n  [1]: 34085 tokens, 5 tool calls, 31.88s \u26a0 max turns\n  [2]: 30583 tokens, 5 tool calls, 32.52s \u26a0 max turns\nOut[10]: ['\\\\text{No specific Caribbean wind instrumentalist composer who emigrated from their homeland could be found in the search results.}', 'Based on my research, I have identified two notable wind instrumentalist composers from Puerto Rico and Cuba who have achieved significant recognition abroad:\\n\\n1.

They speak Shuar, which is part of the broader Jivaroan language family that also includes Achuar, Shiwiar, Aguaruna, and other related groups.\\n\\n## Settlement History and Displacement\\n\\n**20th Century Reorganization**: In the 20th century, the Shuar reorganized themselves into small settlements called \"centros.\" These settlements initially facilitated evangelization by Catholic missionaries but also became a means to defend Shuar land claims against non-indigenous settlers.\\n\\n**Forced Displacement (1950s)**: Many Shuar communities experienced significant displacement in the 1950s when settlers arrived to preach Christianity and clear land for agriculture. Some Shuar children from communities like El Kiim were kidnapped in canoes and taken to mission settlements downriver, leading to a period where traditional practices were largely abandoned.\\n\\n**Return and Resettlement**: Decades later, some Shuar began returning to their original territories. They found highways, cattle ranches, and farms developed by mestizo Ecuadorans. A group managed to occupy small patches of still-unclaimed land and began resurrecting their lost traditions.\\n\\n**Federation Formation**: In 1964, representatives of Shuar centros formed the political Federation (Interprovincial Federation of Shuar Centers - FICSH) to represent their interests. In 1969, the Federation signed a deal with the Ecuadorian government assuming administrative jurisdiction over the Shuar reserve.\\n\\n## Artistic Styles and Cultural Elements\\n\\nWhile the sources mention traditional crafts and cultural expressions, they don\\'t specifically highlight \"unique artistic styles\" as a defining characteristic of Shuar settlements:\\n\\n- **Traditional Clothing**: \"itip\" and \"tarach\" (typical clothing of Shuar men and women)\\n- **Basket Weaving**: \"chankin\" (baskets made from a liana called kaap)\\n- **House Construction**: \"jea\" (traditional houses)\\n- **Pottery**: Made from local clay for domestic use\\n- **Healing Practices**: Traditional medicine and spiritual knowledge through \"uwishin\" (healers)\\n\\n## Contemporary Resettlement Patterns\\n\\nAs a result of colonization and traditional mobility patterns, Shuar families have resettled across Ecuador\\'s 24 provinces. The Shuar Federation helps coordinate land allocation among different Shuar Centers, with over 410 Shuar Centers now existing as territorial base communities.\\n\\n## Current Challenges\\n\\nThe Shuar continue to face threats from mining and oil concessions, economic pressures leading to migration, and ongoing territorial disputes with the Ecuadorian state.

State-level literary accolades in a southern nation for indigenous authors:**\n- I identified the **Daisy Utemorrah Award** from Western Australia, which is a state-level literary award specifically for indigenous authors.\n\n**2. Early co-recipient identifies with ancestral people:**\n- **Marly Wells** (2024 recipient) is a Warlpiri woman, identifying her ancestral people.\n\n**3. These people are part of a larger ethnolinguistic federation:**\n- The Warlpiri belong to the **Pama-Nyungan language family**, Australia's largest and most extensive indigenous language phylum.\n\n**4. Distinct group whose land rights were later upheld:**\n- The Warlpiri and related groups have ongoing land rights battles and native title claims that have been recognized in various forms.\n\n**5. Vernacular tied to riverine areas:**\n- Warlpiri language and culture are connected to desert water sources and riverine areas in Central Australia.\n\n**6. Extensive continental language phylum:**\n- The Pama-Nyungan family covers many indigenous tongues across Australia.\n\n**7. Displaced community moved to settlement with unique artistic style:**\n- The Warlpiri were forcibly resettled at **Papunya Tula** in 1959, a settlement that later became globally famous for its unique artistic style through the Western Desert Art Movement.\n\n**8. Other main aboriginal groups resettled at Papunya Tula:**\n- Research shows the main groups apart from Warlpiri were **Luritja**, Pintupi, Anmatyerr, Kukatja, and Arrernte\/Aranda.\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n**Luritja**\n\nThe Luritja were one of the primary language groups at Papunya Tula, along with the Pintupi, and were forcibly resettled there in 1959 as part of the Australian government's assimilation policies. This settlement became the birthplace of the famous Papunya Tula art movement, making it globally recognized for its unique artistic style.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":1595658.6639881134,"scoring_ms":357.6860427856,"total_ms":1596016.350030899,"info":{"raw_question":"Consider state-level literary accolades in a southern nation, one specifically for indigenous authors.

They did really well. End of story.\"\n- \"I told him, 'if you want to do it, wait a couple of weeks.

I call it 'cock-rock.' I was going into writing sambas at that time and you can't do that in spandex.\"\n\n**Reflecting on his decision overall:**\n- Reid had no regrets, noting that being free from constraints of a hit band allowed his musical muse to roam freely across different genres.\n\nThe comparison shows Reid's pragmatic attitude toward Led Zeppelin (acknowledging their success) versus his artistic rejection of Deep Purple's style, which didn't align with his evolving musical direction toward sambas and more diverse sounds.\n\n==================================================\n\nResult 3:\n\\text{Terry Reid rejected offers to be the frontman for Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, recommending Robert Plant for the Led Zeppelin role.}\n\n==================================================\n[Execution time: 72.37s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_f7e77d1659c64b5e91b17f84\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Let me search more specifically for the \\\\\\\"outdated creatures\\\\\\\" metaphor and try some different search terms\\\\nprompts = [\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Terry Reid Led Zeppelin interview quote\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"British musician rejected band frontman quote\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"rock band dinosaurs metaphor British artist\\\\\\\"\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\nresults = llm_batch(prompts)\\\\nfor i, result in enumerate(results):\\\\n    print(f\\\\\\\"Result {i+1}:\\\\\\\")\\\\n    print(result)\\\\n    print(\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\" + \\\\\\\"=\\\\\\\"*50 + \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\")\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 3 call(s) in 41.99s\n  [0]: 25188 tokens, 4 tool calls, 20.94s \u2713\n  [1]: 16700 tokens, 5 tool calls, 41.98s \u26a0 max turns\n  [2]: 33743 tokens, 5 tool calls, 19.10s \u26a0 max turns\nResult 1:\nBased on my search through multiple sources, the Terry Reid Led Zeppelin interview quote that stands out comes from his final in-depth interview with the San Diego Union-Tribune in April 2025.

The performance of the patients was compared with that of a control group consisting of eight subjects with no history of neurological deficits.\nResults: Patients with neglect as well as patients clinically recovered from neglect showed aberrant search performance in the virtual reality (VR) task, such as mixed search pattern, repeated target pressures and deviating hand movements. The results indicate that in patients with a right hemispheric stroke, this VR application can provide an additional tool for assessment that can identify small variations otherwise not detectable with standard paper-and-pencil tests.\nConclusion: VR technology seems to be well suited for the assessment of visually guided manual exploration in space.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe study used a virtual reality cancellation task to assess visual neglect patterns and hand movement kinematics. The researchers examined eight patients with right hemisphere stroke, four of whom had visual neglect and four who had clinically recovered from neglect. These patients were compared with a control group of eight healthy subjects without neurological deficits. The VR application allowed for detailed analysis of search patterns and hand movements.\n\n**Institutional Affiliations:**\nThe authors were affiliated with:\n- Rehabilitation Medicine, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at G\u00f6teborg University, Sweden\n- Department of Psychology, G\u00f6teborg University, Sweden\n- Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden\n\nNote: While I was able to retrieve the abstract, methodology overview, and some institutional information from the available sources, I couldn't access the full text of the paper which would have provided more complete details about the specific methodology and all institutional affiliations.\n[Execution time: 56.47s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_999e6034a4b145b2bf49fca6\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Verify the researcher background by searching for their previous work on VR rehabilitation\\\\nprompts = [\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search for publications by Broeren, Samuelsson, Stibrant-Sunnerhagen, Blomstrand, and Rydmark from 2004-2008 involving virtual reality, haptics, and upper extremity rehabilitation after stroke from Gothenburg\/Sahlgrenska Academy\\\\\\\"\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\nresults = llm_batch(prompts)\\\\nprint(results[0])\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 1 call(s) in 22.68s\n  [0]: 6270 tokens, 5 tool calls, 22.68s \u26a0 max turns\n\\text{Found 3 main publications: \"Virtual rehabilitation after stroke\" (2008), \"Neglect assessment as an application of virtual reality\" (2007), and \"Virtual reality and haptics as a training device for movement rehabilitation after stroke: a single-case study\" (2007-2008)}\n[Execution time: 75.23s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_74c0f9f72a024c57931dfe77\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Get more specific details about the VR rehabilitation work to confirm the collaboration pattern\\\\nprompts = [\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Find details of the paper 'Virtual rehabilitation after stroke' (2008) and 'Virtual reality and haptics as a training device for movement rehabilitation after stroke: a single-case study' (2007-2008) by the same authors from Gothenburg, focusing on their collaboration with medical informatics and rehabilitation medicine colleagues\\\\\\\"\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\nresults = llm_batch(prompts)\\\\nprint(results[0])\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"llm_batch: 1 call(s) in 29.10s\n  [0]: 17134 tokens, 5 tool calls, 29.09s \u26a0 max turns\n\\text{The 2008 paper 'Virtual rehabilitation after stroke' was published in Studies in Health Technology and Informatics with authors from Gothenburg including J.

Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Key Features of the \"Li\/Dali\" Interrogative System\n\n**1. Multiple Interrogative Markers:**\n- **li**: A clitic particle that attaches to verbs or other sentence elements\n- **dali**: A full interrogative complementizer that can occupy different syntactic positions\n- **Zero marker**: Some questions use no overt interrogative particle\n\n**2. Syntactic Distribution:**\n- **li** functions as a clitic that typically appears in second position in clauses\n- **dali** occupies higher positions in the left periphery of sentences\n- Both can appear in main and embedded questions, but with different constraints\n\n**3. Semantic Differences:**\n- Research suggests subtle meaning differences between li, dali, and zero question markers\n- **li** questions often have polar (yes\/no) force\n- **dali** can function both as a complementizer and interrogative pronoun\n- The choice can affect information structure and focus\n\n**4. Information Structure Integration:**\n- Both li and dali particles play roles in topic-focus articulation\n- They can mark the illocutionary force of sentences\n- The particles interact with contrastive focus and information packaging\n\n**5. Theoretical Framework:**\n- The system operates within a rich left periphery structure following Rizzi's CP cartography\n- Bulgarian shows hierarchical ordering: declarative complementizers lower, interrogative ones higher\n- The organization challenges standard syntactic templates\n\nThis interrogative system is characteristic of the Balkan sprachbund and represents a sophisticated grammatical feature that combines syntax, semantics, and information structure.\nResult 3: To\u0161e Proeski\nResult 4: \\text{Yugoslavia (1989), Serbia (2007)}\nResult 5: Croatia\nResult 6: \\text{pre-national identities}\n[Execution time: 103.33s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_0e5081a1e4de421790714331\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Now I'm getting clearer information!

Here are the key facts:\n\n**What it is:**\n- A bilingual Macedonian-Gospel manuscript from the late 18th\/early 19th century\n- Contains both Greek and Slavic (Macedonian) texts written in Greek letters\n- Represents the vernacular spoken language rather than ecclesiastical language\n\n**Significance:**\n- **Oldest discovered written record** of colloquial Macedonian language\n- Predates other important Macedonian texts like Danail's Lexicon Tetragloson (1802)\n- Documents the Lower Vardar\/Aegean dialects of Southern Macedonia\n- Represents resistance against Greek Hellenization policies\n- Crucial for understanding the development of modern Macedonian national identity\n\n**Discovery and Study:**\n- Discovered in 2003\/04 by University of Helsinki researchers in the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate library in Alexandria\n- Studied collaboratively with Macedonian scholars led by Prof. Ljudmil Spasov from University of Skopje\n- Original manuscript contains about 124 pages, with 74 preserved\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Written during Ottoman rule in what is now Greek Macedonia\n- Created at a time when Greek church policies were actively suppressing Slavic languages\n- The Slavic text was later published in 1852 in Thessaloniki by Pavel Bo\u017eigropski\n- Represents an early attempt to standardize and popularize the Macedonian folk language\n\nThe Konikovo Gospel is considered priceless by linguists and historians as it provides rare documentation of an endangered dialect and serves as evidence of Macedonian linguistic and cultural identity in the face of assimilation pressures.\nResult 5: Based on my research, the Macedonian minority in Croatia self-identifies as \"Macedonians\" (Macedonian: \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0438, Makedonci). This self-identifying term is used in official Croatian government documents and agreements regarding minority rights.\n\nRegarding religious texts, while the Macedonian minority in Croatia would use the same religious texts as Orthodox Christians (particularly the Bible and other Orthodox Christian scriptures), I did not find specific information about distinctive Macedonian religious texts that would be relevant to this minority group in Croatia.\n\nThe primary self-identifying term used is \"Macedonians,\" which is consistent with their ethnic identity rather than a religious identifier.\n[Execution time: 80.60s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_972f4f5e9002404cbfdc0f39\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Great!

Here's what I found:\n\n## Key Research Areas\n\n**1. WDR11 and Kallmann Syndrome\/Ciliopathy Research:**\n- Yeon-Joo Kim's most prominent work focuses on **WDR11**, a gene implicated in congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS)\n- Their research revealed that WDR11 modulates Hedgehog signaling and is essential for ciliogenesis\n- Studies in mouse and zebrafish models showed that WDR11 disruption leads to defective ciliogenesis and developmental abnormalities\n- This work established a novel class of ciliopathy caused by WDR11 mutations\n\n**2. Zebrafish Models:**\n- The research team used zebrafish to study conserved mechanisms of ciliogenesis\n- Zebrafish studies showed that WDR11 knockdown causes developmental defects associated with aberrant Hedgehog signaling and ciliogenesis\n- Phenotypes included microphthalmia, microcephaly, melanocyte disorganization, and defective cilia formation\n\n**3. Connection to Centrioles:**\n- While Kim's main work centers on WDR11 and ciliogenesis rather than specific centriole research, their work is relevant because:\n  - Ciliogenesis requires centrioles (which become basal bodies)\n  - Their studies showed defective ciliogenesis in WDR11-deficient models\n  - The research involves the ciliary basal body\/centriole transition\n\n**4. Pigmentation Connection:**\n- Their zebrafish studies showed melanocyte disorganization, which relates to pigmentation defects\n- This connects to broader ciliopathy phenotypes that can include pigmentation abnormalities\n\n## Key Publications:\n- \"WDR11\u2010mediated Hedgehog signalling defects underlie a new ciliopathy related to Kallmann syndrome\" (EMBO Molecular Medicine, 2017)\n- This work involved both mouse and zebrafish models and established WDR11's critical role in ciliogenesis and Hedgehog signaling\n\nWhile Yeon-Joo Kim's research doesn't specifically focus on centrioles as the primary subject, their work on WDR11 and ciliogenesis is highly relevant to centriole function since centrioles serve as the basal bodies for cilia formation. Their zebrafish studies provide important insights into conserved mechanisms of ciliogenesis that involve centriole-to-basal body conversion.\n--------------------------------------------------\nJi-Young Lee: Ji-Young Lee's research focuses on WDR11 and its role in ciliogenesis and Kallmann syndrome. Her work demonstrates that WDR11 modulates the Hedgehog signaling pathway and is essential for ciliogenesis. Using zebrafish models, she showed that disruption of WDR11 expression leads to defects in ciliated tissues and characteristics associated with defective Hedgehog signaling. Her research established WDR11 mutations as a novel class of ciliopathy related to Kallmann syndrome, a condition characterized by delayed puberty and infertility.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[Execution time: 83.25s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_a2767d0b56b749dd801c87f9\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"Perfect!

Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's.

a materials institute in Germany's Ruhr area, known for research spanning from NiTi alloys processed via powder metallurgy (published around 2008) to the microstructures of superalloys, emerged a study presented at a Materials Research Society symposium. This particular work, published in 2009 and co-authored by a researcher also involved in the aforementioned NiTi and superalloy studies, shifted focus from metallic alloys. It investigated the repeated programming and recovery cycles of a different class of 'smart' material \u2013 specifically, an amorphous commercial polymer.

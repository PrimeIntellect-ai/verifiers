Using resting-state EEG, it delves into the *directed* functional connections within the motor network of patients in the subacute stage, post-rehabilitation. The investigation highlights changes in information flow by employing and comparing two frequency-domain measures designed to assess causal influence, differentiating direct pathways from mediated ones, particularly within alpha and beta rhythms.

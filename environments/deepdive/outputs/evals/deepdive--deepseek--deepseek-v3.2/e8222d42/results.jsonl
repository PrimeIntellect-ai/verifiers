This neighboring settlement, also originating in that historical period, was another territory controlled by this extensive empire, which was distinguished by its management of vital watercourses and its far-reaching trade networks before its power waned, enabling one of its own military commanders to rise to prominence. This commander, having previously served the declining empire, successfully broke away to institute his own dynastic sovereignty.

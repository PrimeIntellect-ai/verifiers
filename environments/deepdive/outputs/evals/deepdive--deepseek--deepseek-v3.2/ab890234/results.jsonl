These junctions, distinct from at-grade crossings, can support special lanes, including for high-occupancy vehicles as mentioned in their general description. Such lanes, if tolled for some users, first appeared in a western state in the 1990s. The company initially managing these pioneering tolled lanes (via a state franchise agreement) is now part of a global group. Its state partner agency, which evolved from a 19th-century bureau, oversees that state's official highway network. This network includes a specific route, with documented legislative origin, that passes a mountain summit often closed in winter and is near a locale known for an amphibian contest.

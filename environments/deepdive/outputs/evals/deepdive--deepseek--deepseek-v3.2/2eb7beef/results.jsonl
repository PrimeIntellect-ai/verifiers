Its goal was to capture the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, in a show of force for Fascist propaganda. An Italian mechanized column under the command of Pietro Badoglio, Marshal of Italy, advanced from the town of Dessie to take Addis Ababa.[1] The march covered a distance of approximately 200 miles (320 km).\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]During the 3rd of October 1935, elements of the Royal Italian Army (*Regio Esercito*) under General Emilio De Bono (the Commander-in-Chief of all Italian armed forces in East Africa) invaded the Ethiopian Empire from staging areas in the Italian colony of Eritrea on what was known as the \"northern front.\"[2] Forces based in Italian Somaliland under General Rodolfo Graziani invaded Ethiopia on what was known as the \"southern front.\" Ground forces on both fronts were amply supported by the Italian Royal Air Force *(Regia Aeronautica*).[ citation needed]\n\nBadoglio replaced De Bono in late 1935 and was immediately faced with the Ethiopian \"Christmas Offensive.\" On 26 December, Badoglio asked for and was permitted to use mustard gas and phosgene. The Italians delivered the poison gas by special artillery canisters and with bombers of the Italian Royal Air Force. While the poorly equipped Ethiopians experienced some success against the more modern weaponry of the Italians, they were not equipped to handle, or experienced in dealing with the \"terrible rain that burned and killed.\"[3]\n\nFrom early 1936, events on the field of battle did not go well for the Imperial Ethiopian Army. On the southern front, Graziani eliminated a large Ethiopian army commanded by Duke (*Ras*) Desta Damtew during the Battle of Ganale Doria using poison gas. Badoglio used poison gas to eliminate many of the Ethiopian northern armies. He destroyed *Ras* Mulugeta Yeggazu's army in the Battle of Amba Aradam. He destroyed *Ras* Kassa Haile Darge's army in the Second Battle of Tembien. Finally, he destroyed *Ras* Imru Haile Sellassie's army in the Battle of Shire.[4]\n\nBy 31 March, the last Ethiopian army on the northern front was commanded in battle by the Emperor himself, Haile Selassie. His army included six battalions of Ethiopia's best troops, the Imperial Guard (*Kebur Zabangna*). The Emperor led an ill-fated counterattack during the Battle of Maychew of which he had little to no chance of victory. The Emperor's army suffered heavy losses during costly frontal assaults on prepared Italian fortifications, but the bulk of his army was destroyed during the days following the battle, when poison gas was again used to decimate the withdrawing columns.[5]\n\nOn 20 April, Marshal Badoglio flew to the town of Dessie in Wollo Province and made his headquarters there. He decided to advance from Dessie and take the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. Dessie is only two-hundred miles (320 km)[6] from Addis Ababa. Except for a procession of refugees, the road to the capital was clear. The Italian Commander-in-Chief faced no substantial Ethiopian resistance.[7]\n\n## Mechanized column\n\n[edit]Because of the lack of resistance between Dessie and Addis Ababa, Badoglio risked a spectacular advance with a \"mechanized column\" for propaganda purposes. In 1936, \"mechanized\" meant infantry transported in a variety of commercial cars and trucks. \"Motorized infantry\" is a more appropriate term for Badoglio's column.[7]\n\nThanks to the organizational genius of a Quartermaster-General Fidenzio Dall'Ora, Badoglio's \"mechanized column\" came together in Dessie between 21 and 25 April. Dall'Ora was able to organize the most powerful \"mechanized\" column to appear on an African road up to that time. In addition to 12,500 Italian troops, the column included 1,785 cars and trucks of all makes (Fiats, Lancias, Alfa-Romeos, Fords, Chevrolets, Bedfords, and Studebakers), a squadron of light tanks (L3s), eleven batteries of artillery,[7] and aircraft.[6] Special vehicles carried 193 horses so that when the column arrived at the gates of Addis Ababa, the Marshal and his staff could leave their cars and ride in triumph on horseback.[7]\n\n## March\n\n[edit]On 24 April, Badoglio sent two columns of 4,000 Eritreans ahead by force march to protect his mechanized force as a precautionary measure. But the adversity the Eritreans and the march itself encountered was mainly caused by rain and mud. Badoglio's precautionary measure proved to be superfluous.[7]\n\n### Imperial highway\n\n[edit]Badoglio's mechanized force advanced along the Imperial Highway between Dessie and Addis Ababa. The Italian Commander-in-Chief was to uncharitably refer to this road as \"a bad cart track\".[8]\n\nBadoglio expected some show of resistance at Termaber Pass, and the mechanized column did halt there for two days but all was quiet. The column stopped because a section of the road had been demolished and had to be repaired.[7] On 4 May the Italian formation was ambushed in Chacha, near Debre Berhan, by Ethiopian forces under Haile Mariam Mammo. In the ensuing battle,\nHaile Mariam's men killed approximately 170 Italian colonial troops and captured four Italians, two of whom were doctors. They were later released.[9]\n\n### Addis Ababa\n\n[edit]In Addis Ababa, Emperor Haile Selassie visited the French Legation. After explaining to French Minister Paul Bodard that further defense of the capital was impossible, he explained that it was best for Empress Menen Asfaw and their two sons, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen, 19, and Prince Makonnen, 13, to leave the country. Ultimately they would go to the Coptic monastery in the British Mandate of Palestine, but he asked the French Minister whether the Imperial Family could temporarily find refuge in French Somaliland and was assured by Bodard that they could.[10]\n\nHaile Selassie then returned to his Palace and crowds gathered at the Palace steps. To the gathering throng, he said, \"Ethiopia, will fight until the last soldier and the last inch! Let every man who is not wounded or sick take arms and enough food to last five days and march north to fight the invader!\" The crowd roared back to their Emperor: \"We will go!\"[10][nb 1]\n\nForgetting the raw gas burns on his arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. He knew that the Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One possibility was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially, his chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under *Ras* Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but rather flee the country to avoid his execution.[10]\n\nAfter his meeting with his chieftains, Haile Selassie visited Sir Sidney Barton at the British Legation. He spoke softly to Sir Sidney but to the point. Britain had encouraged him with fine words and had made many promises. However, Britain had provided Ethiopia with few guns for which the Ethiopians had paid cash. Haile Selassie stressed that he had risked his own life for Ethiopia but also for the League of Nations. He asked Sir Sidney whether Britain would now come to his aid. They declined.[10]\n\nBefore he departed, Haile Selassie ordered that the government of Ethiopia be moved to Gore, he ordered that the mayor of Addis Ababa maintain order in the city until the Italian arrival, and he appointed *Ras* Imru Haile Selassie as his Prince Regent during his absence.[11]\n\nLate on 2 May, after the Emperor left the city to go into exile, there was a breakdown in civil order. Only the dregs of Ethiopia's soldiery were left behind in the doomed capital. They went wild, looted shops, screamed curses at foreigners, and fired rifles into the air. The new Palace, pride of Haile Selassie, was thrown open to the people. Most foreigners found safety within the British compound. In twenty-four hours, the Ethiopian Empire fell apart and native law and order disappeared. Rioting in Addis Ababa grew worse by the hour. An attack was made on the Treasury's \"gold house.\" A few loyal employees tried to save the remnant of Emperor's gold with machine guns, but sword-swinging looters rushed them and cut off their hands as they clung to their guns.[10]\n\n### The Arrival of the Italians\n\n[edit]During the evening of 4 May, elements of the I Eritrean Brigade reached the outskirts of Addis Ababa. They reached the city before Badoglio's mechanized column and they managed to accomplish this feat on foot.[12] Meanwhile, Badoglio's motorized column, pushing on as fast as possible, drew closer and closer. Italian aircraft reconnoitered over the city.[ citation needed]\n\nThe main column reached the capital at 4:00 pm on 5 May.\n\nHeavy rain fell as Badoglio's forces entered the city and restored order. The rioting that started after Haile Selassie left lasted until order was restored with the arrival of the Italians. White flags were displayed everywhere as Badoglio made his triumphal entry into the city of the \"King of Kings.\"[13] Many city residents fled south or tried to take refuge in the foreign compounds which they had been attacking.[ citation needed]\n\nA detachment of Ethiopian customs guards presented arms as Badoglio's car drove past them. Further on, an Italian guard of honor, which accompanied the advance guard for this very purpose, paid Badoglio the same courtesy. There was no question now of stopping to allow Badoglio to use the horses brought for this occasion. The car and truck bound procession continued.[13][nb 2]\n\nWhen Badoglio's entourage pulled up in front of the Italian legation at 5:45 pm, the Tricolour of the Kingdom of Italy was hoisted. Then followed three cheers for Italy's King Victor Emmanuel and three cheers for Italy's Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. After the cheering, Badoglio turned to a senior member of the Italian Royal Air Force and said:\n\n- \"We've done it! We've won!\"\n[13]\n\nThe fall of Addis Ababa had been expected in Italy. When the news reached Rome during the evening of 5 May, there were scenes of wild excitement. Mussolini was called back ten times by the jubilant crowds at the Palazzo Venezia.[7]\n\nSignificantly, the march was completed in only ten days across difficult terrain and in bad weather. It was an achievement that demonstrated the offensive potential of motorized forces in securing bold advances.[6] However, the Italian \"March of the Iron Will\" turned out to be little more than a logistics exercise. An anonymous journalist at the time said this:\n\n- \"Far more of a sports event than a page in military history.\"\n[7]\n\n## Aftermath\n\n[edit]During the week following Marshal Badoglio's entry into Addis Ababa, Dr. Johann Hans Kirchholtes, the German Minister to Ethiopia, visited what had been the Italian Legation in the Ethiopian capital city. Badoglio was now Viceroy and Governor-General of Italian East Africa and the former Italian Legation was now his headquarters. Kirchholtes provided the first recognition by any foreign government that the conquest of Ethiopia was an accomplished fact.[15]\n\nMeanwhile, one of Marshal Badoglio's staff officers, Captain Adolfo Alessandri, visited every foreign legation in Addis Ababa. Alessandri politely explained to each envoy that they would enjoy \"every diplomatic privilege until the time of your departure.\" This was Italy's official notification to the world that occupied Ethiopia would not be considered to be on the same footing as the Japanese Empire's puppet state of Manchukuo. Instead, the former Ethiopian Empire was to be a colony of the Kingdom of Italy. Giuseppe Bottai was named as the first Governor of Addis Ababa and Haile Selassie's former Palace became his residence.[15]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- East African Campaign (World War II)\n- Red Terror (Ethiopia)\n- Second Italo-Abyssinian War\n- Timeline of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War\n- Achille Starace\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]**^***Time*did not indicate what happened to the five-thousand men who marched north from Addis Ababa.**^***Time*indicates that Badoglio did stop to mount up and did enter Addis Ababa on horseback: \"After much sweating and shouting, the procession was reformed. First came a patrol of Blackshirt motorcyclists, young and exuberant, followed by ten tankettes, each one hastily named after a battle of the past seven months. Marshal Badoglio entered on horseback.\"[14]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]### Citations\n\n[edit]**^**Barker 1971, p. 108.**^**Barker 1971, p. 33.**^**Barker 1971, p. 56.**^**Barker 1971, p. 87.**^**Barker 1971, p. 96.- ^\n**a****b**Walker 2003, p. 36.**c** - ^\n**a****b****c****d****e****f****g**Barker 1971, p. 109.**h** **^**Mockler 2002, p. 127.**^**Akyeampong & Gates 2012, p. 543.- ^\n**a****b****c****d****e***Time*magazine, 11 May 1936[*better source needed*] **^**Mockler 2002, p. 136.**^**Mockler 2002, p. 141.- ^\n**a****b**Barker 1971, p. 128.**c** **^***Time*magazine, 18 May 1936- ^\n**a****b***Time*magazine, 13 May 1936\n\n### Sources\n\n[edit]- Akyeampong, Emmanuel Kwaku; Gates, Henry Louis, eds.

It provides surveillance of airspace from potential incursions or attacks from across North America's polar region. It replaced the Distant Early Warning Line system in the late 1980s.\n\n## Overview\n\n[edit]The NWS consists of both long range AN\/FPS-117 and short range AN\/FPS-124 surveillance radars, operated and maintained by North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).[1]: 16 There are 13 long range sites and 36 short range sites.\n\nIn Canada, the station sites are owned or leased by the Government of Canada, which also owns most of the infrastructure. The radars and tactical radios are owned by the United States Air Force.[1]: 16 The Alaska Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska controls the stations in Alaska; the Canada East and Canada West Regional Operations Control Centres (ROCCs) at CFB North Bay, Ontario control the stations in Canada. ROCC information is then passed to the NORAD Combat Operations Centre (COC) at Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nEach Long Range site consists of accommodation buildings, radar towers and radomes, generator and fuel systems, satellite terminals, automated weather station, and UHF and VHF ground-air-ground radio.[1]: 17 Short Range sites consist of a single AN\/FPS-124 radar, satellite terminals, power generation and fuel systems, and a small emergency shelter that can accommodate six people. Some short range stations lack weather stations and UHF Tactical Radios.[1]: 17\u201318, 24\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, constructed in the late 1950s, was reaching obsolescence in the 1980s. With the signing of North American Air Defence Modernization agreement at the \"Shamrock Summit\" between Prime Minister Mulroney and President Reagan in Quebec City on 18 March 1985, the DEW Line began its eventual upgrading and transition becoming the North Warning System (NWS) of today.\n\nThe NWS began limited operation in 1988 with the commissioning and acceptance of the three newly constructed east coast sites BAF-3 Brevoort Island, Nunavut, LAB-2 Saglek and LAB-6 Cartwright, both in Labrador. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, new NWS LRR radars replaced former DEW Line sites. DEW sites that were not transitioned to North Warning operation were eventually closed down. The official activation of the NWS and inactivation of the DEW Line took place on 15 July 1993.\n\nThe bi-national North Warning System Office (NWSO) is located in Ottawa, Ontario and staffed with both Canadian and American military and civilian personnel. Staffed sites are operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, but physically staffed by civilian contractors. Logistical and maintenance support for the NWS is supplied by the Air Force Materiel Command of the United States Air Force, located at Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC), Hill Air Force Base, Utah.\n\n## Site remediation\n\n[edit]The former DEW Line sites were operated using practices and materials accepted by the environmental standards of the time. With their closure and many of them rebuilt as NWS sites, a clean-up project was undertaken to remove surplus infrastructure, treat chemically contaminated soils, and stabilize landfill sites. The clean-up was designed to keep chemical contamination from the DEW Line sites out of the Arctic food chain, and ensure that the sites are restored to an environmentally safe condition. In 1989, the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) started investigating the environmental conditions of the DEW Line sites and commenced clean-up work at two sites in 1996. The clean-up of 21 sites was scheduled to be completed in 2013. In March 2014 DND announced the remediation project was complete.\n\n## Stations\n\n[edit]The NWS consists of 15 long-range radars (11 in Canada, of which eight were DEW Line sites) and 39 short-range radars (36 in Canada).[2] The system forms a 4,800 km (2,983 mi) long and 320 km (199 mi) wide \"tripwire\" stretching from Alaska to southern Labrador.

It provides surveillance of airspace from potential incursions or attacks from across North America's polar region. It replaced the Distant Early Warning Line system in the late 1980s.\n\n## Overview\n\n[edit]The NWS consists of both long range AN\/FPS-117 and short range AN\/FPS-124 surveillance radars, operated and maintained by North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).[1]: 16 There are 13 long range sites and 36 short range sites.\n\nIn Canada, the station sites are owned or leased by the Government of Canada, which also owns most of the infrastructure. The radars and tactical radios are owned by the United States Air Force.[1]: 16 The Alaska Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska controls the stations in Alaska; the Canada East and Canada West Regional Operations Control Centres (ROCCs) at CFB North Bay, Ontario control the stations in Canada. ROCC information is then passed to the NORAD Combat Operations Centre (COC) at Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nEach Long Range site consists of accommodation buildings, radar towers and radomes, generator and fuel systems, satellite terminals, automated weather station, and UHF and VHF ground-air-ground radio.[1]: 17 Short Range sites consist of a single AN\/FPS-124 radar, satellite terminals, power generation and fuel systems, and a small emergency shelter that can accommodate six people. Some short range stations lack weather stations and UHF Tactical Radios.[1]: 17\u201318, 24\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, constructed in the late 1950s, was reaching obsolescence in the 1980s. With the signing of North American Air Defence Modernization agreement at the \"Shamrock Summit\" between Prime Minister Mulroney and President Reagan in Quebec City on 18 March 1985, the DEW Line began its eventual upgrading and transition becoming the North Warning System (NWS) of today.\n\nThe NWS began limited operation in 1988 with the commissioning and acceptance of the three newly constructed east coast sites BAF-3 Brevoort Island, Nunavut, LAB-2 Saglek and LAB-6 Cartwright, both in Labrador. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, new NWS LRR radars replaced former DEW Line sites. DEW sites that were not transitioned to North Warning operation were eventually closed down. The official activation of the NWS and inactivation of the DEW Line took place on 15 July 1993.\n\nThe bi-national North Warning System Office (NWSO) is located in Ottawa, Ontario and staffed with both Canadian and American military and civilian personnel. Staffed sites are operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, but physically staffed by civilian contractors. Logistical and maintenance support for the NWS is supplied by the Air Force Materiel Command of the United States Air Force, located at Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC), Hill Air Force Base, Utah.\n\n## Site remediation\n\n[edit]The former DEW Line sites were operated using practices and materials accepted by the environmental standards of the time. With their closure and many of them rebuilt as NWS sites, a clean-up project was undertaken to remove surplus infrastructure, treat chemically contaminated soils, and stabilize landfill sites. The clean-up was designed to keep chemical contamination from the DEW Line sites out of the Arctic food chain, and ensure that the sites are restored to an environmentally safe condition. In 1989, the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) started investigating the environmental conditions of the DEW Line sites and commenced clean-up work at two sites in 1996. The clean-up of 21 sites was scheduled to be completed in 2013. In March 2014 DND announced the remediation project was complete.\n\n## Stations\n\n[edit]The NWS consists of 15 long-range radars (11 in Canada, of which eight were DEW Line sites) and 39 short-range radars (36 in Canada).[2] The system forms a 4,800 km (2,983 mi) long and 320 km (199 mi) wide \"tripwire\" stretching from Alaska to southern Labrador.

Such integration reportedly heightened friction between two major denominations of a global faith within that territory. The broader animosity between these denominations has seen one extremist organization direct violence against one denomination specifically. This organization's acts included an assault on a significant religious shrine, the resting place of a venerated figure's descendant. During this assault, what full name belongs to the local resident lauded for a courageous act of intervention against an assailant, thereby reducing harm within the sanctuary?\nReason step by step using the given tools and provide the final answer in \\boxed{}.","role":"user"}],"completion":[{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_6e0e0826ec984129b858211d\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"American software entrepreneur philanthropist examining LGBT rights in Pakistan\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Tim Gill - Wikipedia\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tim_Gill\nTim Gill (born October 18, 1953) is an American computer software programmer, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and LGBTQ rights activist.\n\n---\n\nResult 1: [PDF] From Margins to Mainstream - Inclusive Youth Entrepreneurship in ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.undp.org\/sites\/g\/files\/zskgke326\/files\/2025-01\/undp-rbap-ycl-from-margins-to-mainstream-inclusive-youth-entrpereneurship-report-2024.pdf\nThe findings emphasize the complex interplay of factors hindering the success of young entrepreneurs, including women, persons with disabilities, LGBTI+ ...\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Turning Passion Into Action: Giving While Living\nURL: https:\/\/www.philanthropyroundtable.org\/resource\/turning-passion-into-action-giving-while-living\/\nSoftware entrepreneur Tim Gill and other philanthropists choose to dedicate their giving to particular causes or social issues that inspire ...\n\n---\n\nResult 3: Promoting LGBTI rights in foreign policy: strategies for action while ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/21565503.2025.2543302\nWe examine three key strategies of foreign policy leaders and international civil society groups that were repeatedly emphasized in our interviews: (1) ...\n\n---\n\nResult 4: Community | RightsCon Summit Series\nURL: https:\/\/www.rightscon.org\/community\/\nRightsCon brings together business leaders, policy makers, general counsels, government representatives, technologists, and human rights defenders from around ...\n\n---\n\nResult 5: lesbian history | Ronni Sanlo\nURL: https:\/\/ronnisanlo.com\/tag\/lesbian-history\/\nHe is an American software entrepreneur, philanthropist, and creator of the Gill Foundation, one of the first major foundations to benefit the LGBTQ community.\n\n---\n\nResult 6: Signature Lectures - UGA Provost's Office\nURL: https:\/\/provost.uga.edu\/events-programs\/signature-lectures\/\nThe Signature Lecture Series features speakers noted nationally or internationally for their broad, multidisciplinary appeal and compelling bodies of work.\n\n---\n\nResult 7: My love for the US and Pakistan is equal, both are my countries ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/itanweerahmed\/videos\/my-love-for-the-us-and-pakistan-is-equal-both-are-my-countries-born-in-pakistan-\/879917474182938\/\n... entrepreneur #philanthropist #USA #Pakistan | Tanweer Ahmed | Facebook ...

Local media said he blew himself up after throwing a grenade.\n\n\"I saw bodies everywhere. I saw bodies of women and children,\" one man told local media.\n\nAnother described scenes of chaos and devastation, with the shrine's courtyard \"filled with thousands of people who were crying and wailing\".\n\nImages from inside the shrine showed the floor covered with blood, with clothing and sandals strewn around.\n\nThe Edhi Welfare Trust, which runs Pakistan's largest ambulance service, said 43 of the dead were men, nine women and 20 children.\n\nAt least 250 others were wounded, a senior police official told the BBC. The only hospital in the area was said to be overwhelmed.\n\nThe critically injured were being sent by ambulance to Jamshoro and Hyderabad, some two hours away. The military said navy helicopters capable of flying at night would be sent to airlift the critically injured.\n\n## Return of violence: by M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad\n\nAfter a couple of years of diminishing violence credited to a military operation that kicked off in June 2014, the militants appear to have returned with a vengeance.\n\nIn six back-to-back attacks since Sunday, suicide bombers have killed nearly 100 people in different parts of the country.\n\nThere have been some spectacular, though sporadic, attacks in recent months that have exacted a significant toll on human life.\n\nBut the latest surge stands out in so far as it has come amid reports of the reunification of some powerful factions of the Pakistani Taliban. Some of these groups have links with the Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter of the so-called Islamic State which itself is composed largely of a former faction of the Pakistani Taliban.\n\nThis surge has blown the lid off an air of complacency that was brought on by statements of the military and civilian leaders to the effect that Pakistan had successfully defeated the militants.\n\nThe army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, now seems to have lost patience. On Thursday he issued a veiled threat to some neighbouring countries that \"each drop of [the] nation's blood shall be avenged, and avenged immediately. No more restraint for anyone\".\n\nPakistani officials have been accusing Afghanistan of not eliminating the sanctuaries of anti-Pakistan militants on its soil.\n\nIt has also been blaming India for using Afghan soil to foment trouble in Pakistan. But many here believe that militancy refuses to die down because Pakistan continues to tolerate selective militant structures as cover for its own covert wars that sustain the economy of its security establishment.\n\nPrime Minister Sharif has vowed to fight the militants who have carried out attacks.\n\n\"The past few days have been hard, and my heart is with the victims,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"But we can't let these events divide us, or scare us. We must stand united in this struggle for the Pakistani identity, and universal humanity.\"\n\nThe head of the military, Gen Qamer Javed Bajwa said that \"each drop of [the] nation's blood shall be revenged, and revenged immediately. No more restraint for anyone\".\n\nSufism, a mystical order of Islam, has been practised in Pakistan for centuries. Most of the radical Sunni militant groups despise the Sufis, as well as Shia Muslims, as heretics.\n\nTwo separate bombings in the country's north-west killed at least seven people on Wednesday.\n\nAnd on Monday, at least 13 people died in a suicide bombing in the eastern city of Lahore. A faction of the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ur-Ahrar, said it had carried out that attack.\n\n- Published15 February 2017\n\n- Published13 February 2017\n\n- Published1 February 2017","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_e5c4098f060b4db6938f024a\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"attack on shrine of descendant of Prophet Muhammad in Pakistan local resident hero intervention\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] the state of sectarianism in pakistan - Department of Justice\nURL: https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/file\/276106\/dl?inline=\nSectarian conflict in Pakistan is the direct consequence of state policies of Islamisation and marginalisation of secular democratic forces.\n\n---\n\nResult 1: International Religious Freedom Reports: Custom Report Excerpts\nURL: https:\/\/www.state.gov\/report\/custom\/559a621f38\nThe constitution establishes Islam as the state religion but stipulates followers of religions other than Islam may exercise their faith within the limits ...\n\n---\n\nResult 2: [PDF] The Muslim World After 9\/11 - RAND\nURL: https:\/\/www.rand.org\/content\/dam\/rand\/pubs\/monographs\/2004\/RAND_MG246.pdf\nSeptember 11 Terrorist Attacks, 2001\u2014Influence. 4.

Pakistani authorities alleged that the attacks were orchestrated by jihadists in Afghanistan.[17]\n\n## Bombing\n\n[edit]The suicide bomber struck the pilgrims during a dhamaal (ritual dance) after the evening prayers.[2] The bomber threw a grenade which failed to explode.[2] Then he blew himself up inside the shrine hall under the dome, near its Golden Gate.[10] The bomber, believed to be an Afghan national, had bypassed the security check at the shrine.[18]\n\nAt least 21 children were believed to be among the dead.[19] The bomber used a suicide jacket, with the ball bearings in the jacket acting as shrapnel and causing casualties.[1]\n\n## Aftermath\n\n[edit]The injured and deceased were immediately shifted to the Taluka Medical Hospital[2] which was not equipped with a trauma centre to deal with emergency cases.[10] The medical facilities in Sehwan were basic, and some of the injured were in critical condition.[19][2] A state of emergency was declared for all hospitals in the neighbouring areas.[2] Pakistan Navy helicopters and a Pakistan Air Force C-130 were dispatched for rescue operations.[10]\n\nHours after the attack, law enforcement agencies launched a nationwide crackdown and search operation, during which over 100 militants were killed and scores arrested.[20] Several insurgents were confronted in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Weapons, including hand grenades, were recovered from their hideouts.[19] Police arrested a suspected facilitator in connection to the Sehwan attack from Johi, a town in Sindh's Dadu District.[18]\nOn 22 February 2017, a few days after attack, Pakistan Military launched Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad to eliminate terrorism.[21]\n\n### Resumption of daily services\n\n[edit]The next morning, the shrine's caretaker continued the daily tradition of ringing the shrine's bell at 3:30 am, and said that he would not be intimidated by terrorists.[22] The shrine's *dhamaal*, or meditative dancing ceremony, resumed the evening following the attack.[23] A few days later, several leading Pakistani artists and performers partook in a *dhamaal* at the shrine as a defiant response to radical Islamists.[24]\n\n## Reactions\n\n[edit]### Domestic\n\n[edit]Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the blast,[10] and said that \"an attack on the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar is an attack on the progressive and inclusive future of Pakistan.\"[2] A statement released by the military's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that the army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, had ordered that immediate assistance be provided to civil authorities.[2] Bajwa said \"Each drop of the nation's blood shall be revenged, and revenged immediately. No more restraint for anyone.\"[25]\n\nThe Governor of Sindh, Mohammad Zubair, condemned the blast and said \"Sindh is a land of the Sufis. The terrorists have targeted the devotees to achieve their nefarious designs.\"[2] The Government of Sindh announced three days of mourning in Sindh, while the governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan also announced a day of mourning in their respective provinces.[26]\n\n#### Strikes on Afghan camps\n\n[edit]ISPR spokesman, Major General Asif Ghafoor, tweeted: \"Recent terrorist acts are being executed on directions from hostile powers and from sanctuaries in Afghanistan. We shall defend and respond\".[25] A few hours after the incident, the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was sealed indefinitely for security reasons.[27][28][29] On 17 February, the Pakistan Army summoned Afghan embassy officials to the General Headquarters and handed over a list of 76 insurgents hiding in Afghanistan. The army demanded that Kabul take \"immediate action\" or have them \"handed over to Pakistan\".[17] The same day, army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa made a telephone call to the general commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, John W. Nicholson, and expressed concern over such incidents in Pakistan linked to safe havens in Afghanistan. Bajwa stated \"Such terrorist activities and inaction against them are testing our current policy of cross border restraint\" and urged Nicholson for cooperation in dismantling the militant networks, in addition to briefing him about the list of wanted terrorists.[30] Later, Pakistani security forces destroyed a dozen Jamaat-ul-Ahrar camps across the border in eastern Afghanistan, and killed over a dozen militants including a top trainer of suicide bombers.[31][32] The strikes were confirmed by Afghan sources, who said that several Pakistani artillery rounds had hit Nangarhar Province's Lal Pur District and that \"15 to 20 terrorists, among them Commander Rehman Baba, have been killed and many more injured.\"[33] The Afghan foreign ministry also protested the shelling by Pakistan on its territory.[34][35]\n\n### International\n\n[edit]- Afghanistan: President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, stating that \"terrorists once again, proved that they have no respect for Islamic values\".\n[36]Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack and offered sympathy to the families of victims and people of Pakistan.[37] - Belarus: Ambassador Andrei Ermolovich condemned the Sehwan blast while expressing solidarity with Pakistan. He also said that Belarus stands with Pakistan in its efforts for elimination of terrorism.\n[38] - China: President Xi Jinping condemned the attack and offered sympathy to the Pakistani people. He said that China \"will stand ready to firmly support Pakistan in its effort to fight terrorism, maintain national stability and safeguard its people\". Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also expressed shock and condemned the attack.\n[37] - India: The Indian external affairs ministry strongly condemned the attack on the Lal Qalandar shrine at Sehwan and offered their sympathies to Pakistani people.\n[39] - Japan: A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that \"Japan is shocked and saddened by the suicide attack\".\n[40][41] - Kyrgyzstan: President Almazbek Atambayev expressed sorrow and offered condolences over the terrorist attack.\n[37] - Russia: President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences over the incident, while reaffirming Russia's \"readiness to further step up counter-terrorist cooperation\" with Pakistan.\n[37][40] - Tajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon offered condolence adding that the Tajik people \"are deeply saddened by the tragic news\".\n[40] - United States: Acting State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said the U.S. condemned the suicide bombing and offered its \"support to the Pakistani government as it works to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice\". He added: \"We stand with the people of Pakistan in their fight against terrorism and remain committed to the security of the South Asia region.\"\n[42]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- List of terrorist incidents linked to Islamic State \u2013 Khorasan Province\n- Sufism in Pakistan\n- Terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2017\n\n## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a**Hashmi, Talha (17 February 2017). \"Sehwan suicide bomber was not female: CTD official Raja Umar Khattab\".**b***Geo TV*.

The success of this treatment is highly dependent on parameters such as tissue electrical properties, applied voltages and spatial relations in placement of electrodes that are used to establish a cell-permeabilizing electric field in target tissue. Non-thermal irreversible electroporation techniques for ablation of tissue depend similarly on these parameters. In the treatment planning stage, if oversimplified approximations for evaluation of electric field are used, such as U\/d (voltage-to-distance ratio), sufficient field strength may not be reached within the entire target (tumor) area, potentially resulting in treatment failure.\n\n### Results\n\nIn order to provide an aid in education of medical personnel performing electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation, assist in visualizing the electric field in needle electrode electroporation and the effects of changes in electrode placement, an application has been developed both as a desktop- and a web-based solution. It enables users to position up to twelve electrodes in a plane of adjustable dimensions representing a two-dimensional slice of tissue. By means of manipulation of electrode placement, i.e. repositioning, and the changes in electrical parameters, the users interact with the system and observe the resulting electrical field strength established by the inserted electrodes in real time. The field strength is calculated and visualized online and instantaneously reflects the desired changes, dramatically improving the user friendliness and educational value, especially compared to approaches utilizing general-purpose numerical modeling software, such as finite element modeling packages.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we outline the need and offer a solution in medical education in the field of electroporation-based treatments, e.g. primarily electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible tissue ablation. We present the background, the means of implementation and the fully functional application, which is the first of its kind. While the initial feedback from students that have evaluated this application as part of an e-learning course is positive, a formal study is planned to thoroughly evaluate the current version and identify possible future improvements and modifications.\n\n**Keywords:** Education on electroporation, Electromagnetic field visualization, Applications in subject areas, Interdisciplinary projects, Interactive learning environments\n\n## Background\n\n### Electroporation\n\nElectroporation is a term coined in the early 1980's [1] for phenomena already described more than a decade earlier [2], when an interesting property of biological membranes has been observed. Electroporation mainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly composed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short and intense electric fields. The physical mechanism responsible for increased permeability is thought to be the formation of nano-scale defects termed *pores* (thus electro*poration*) in the lipid structure [3,4]. This allows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact mechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is too high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not temporary, but instead result in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversible electroporation. On the other hand, if the cells survive, increased permeability of membrane is only temporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible electroporation. This observed transient increase in permeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of applications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA) delivery, introduction of drugs into cells, fusion of cells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer, gene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of drugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6,7] for an overview. In these applications viability of the porated cells is important and thus irreversible electroporation is consciously avoided and generally considered to be an undesired side effect. However, there are also interesting medical applications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering the domains of industrial [9,10] and environmental [11] applications.\n\n### Electrochemotherapy\n\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that successfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs. For successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate amplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and shape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake and hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been identified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13,14]. The transport of bleomycin across the nonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited [15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and DNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity of bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several thousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is the electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent increase in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to reach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17,18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be eradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be permeabilized, i.e. all cells in the tumor have to be exposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means that the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends on both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high electric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we must consider before we can confidently assume we have successfully electroporated the entire tumor area. First, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue electrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity compared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric field strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields in the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue of electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their shape, size and position. In general, there are two types of electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate electrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with either a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two plates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively, which ensures good electrical contact, but has other drawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure good electrical contact and optimal distance between electrodes to fit the tumor [21,22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous and dependent on their diameter, distance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013 the task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even more arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19,24] and in vivo studies [25] on importance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need for careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted by a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) project, in the scope of which standard operating procedures for ECT were published [26]. However, in advanced cases such as intracranial [27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need for patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29,30].\n\n### Non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation and other techniques\n\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation. While the high number of applied pulses used to achieve classical irreversible electroporation may also cause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the current-conducting tissue, non-thermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since it results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and no protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical applications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is technically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of chemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison to other ablation methods such as RF ablation or cryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the connective structure [8,32]. Since it has been observed that NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves, there is hope of using this technique in treatment of tumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as this treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of ECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure adequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other minimally invasive therapies for treatment of deep-seated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g. high intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation. The latter is a minimally invasive procedure where a needle electrode is inserted percutaneously into a tumor, much as in ECT or NTIRE. The electrode acts as an antenna for electromagnetic waves emitted by a generator; the tumor is heated up and thereby destroyed [34]. As with NTIRE or ECT, the need for accurate needle placement exists and its importance has been evaluated. Success, i.e. improved treatment, has been proven to be correlated to the experience of the operator [34].\n\n### The need for education on electroporation\n\nAs outlined in the paragraphs above, both reversible and irreversible electroporation are promising approaches in treating solid tumors, however their success is highly dependent on local field strength. Poorly defined or unknown properties such as tissue conductivities and inhomogeneities in addition to our choice of electrode type, positions and pulse amplitudes, affect the electric field distribution. With many factors to take into consideration, we may dismiss important uncontrolled variables or use a well-studied but irrelevant model that cannot be applied to a specific situation. An example of this is the persistent use of a very simple approximation for electric field strength that holds only under very particular conditions. This frequently used approximation equates the electric field strength *E* to the voltage *U* applied on the electrodes divided by the distance *d* between the electrodes, i.e. *E* \u2248 *U*\/*d*. Since the local electric field strength has been identified as the key factor in achieving both reversible and irreversible electroporation (see [19] for details), i.e. local *E* has to reach a certain threshold value *E*rev or *E*irrev, it is the parameter we most often optimize our electrode configuration for. There is a problem, however, since this simple relation is strictly valid only in an isotropic homogeneous medium between two infinitely large parallel plate electrodes. When using parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this simple model best approximates the actual field strength far from the electrode edges, provided the electrode width is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results are even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of course there are no parallel plates to speak of (see Figure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore, using the simple parallel plate approximation for *E* in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result in significant reduction of response in treatment for which the complete response rate has been shown to be as high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way into more and more clinics worldwide [36-39] and establishing themselves as safe and effective treatments of cancer, it is becoming more and more important that medical personnel performing and planning ECT (or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action, the underlying physics and possible pitfalls. This paper presents an application for visualization and analysis of the electric field strength in multiple-needle-electrode electroporation aimed at users with basic knowledge of the principles of electroporation, but lack of education in physics and engineering who may therefore need visual, interactive and didactic instruments to gain a deeper understanding of the principles necessary for effective use of these promising treatments. Since educational applications of the sort are scarce and research is focused primarily on advancing the field rather than educating, the need to explore options and applications in this area of engineering education seems pressing and applicative results should be welcome. The application is part of a now firmly established annual course Electroporation Based Technologies and Treatments, EBTT (http:\/\/www.ebtt.org). The e-learning laboratory exercise into which the presented application has been incorporated, has been developed and described previously [40].\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Theoretical background\n\nThe theoretical background for the mathematical engine that is at the heart of our application has been derived from the electrostatic field theory, more specifically, extended from a solution for electrostatic potential generated by two long parallel charged conductors given in [41]. We have omitted the detailed mathematical derivations here as they are outside the scope of this paper; however, we have included a derivation of the equations below in the Appendix for those readers that may be interested in further development or modifications to our model. Below, we specify only the final formulation of the mathematical model and the method of application of this analytical solution into the field-calculating engine that represents the core of Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation (ApiVizTEP), since this is the only essential part of the application around which the user interface is built. Similarly to the approach that we present in this paper, other analytical models have been developed previously using complex analysis. For a six-needle array, one may find a first-order analytical approximation for the electric field strength in [42]. Other authors have expanded on this approach further, see e.g. [43] and [44]; however, these solutions do not give an accurate analytical expression for the electric field strength since quite possibly such a solution cannot be obtained for three or more electrodes active concurrently at a given time. Since currently electroporation devices mostly power only one pair of electrodes at a time [45], we have not pursued a solution with more than two concurrently active electrodes, thus avoiding the derivation of an approximate solution. Instead, we give an accurate solution for a two needle electrode system that is not based (mathematically) on previously published work.\n\nThe accurate analytical solution for electric field strength of two long parallel cylindrical conductors (needle electrodes) on a plane perpendicular to the conductor longitudinal axis (2-D solution), is given by the following equation\n\n*V*AB is the voltage on an electrode pair (anode\u2013cathode), *d*AB is the distance between the electrodes, *\u03c1*0 is the electrode diameter, while *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B are coordinates of the center of the electrode mathematical equivalents (the electrical center *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B of the electrodes is eccentric to the actual geometrical center *x*A, *y*A and *x*B, *y*B due to finite i.e. non-zero electrode diameter).\n\nOur application employs a mesh of 400 \u00d7 400 points and the electric field strength *E* is calculated for each of the 160.000 points using the expression above. The time needed to perform the necessary calculations and display the results is practically negligible, ranging from a few hundred milliseconds for two active electrodes up to one and a half seconds for twelve active electrodes using an average modern personal computer, i.e. at least a dual core 2 GHz processor equipped with 2 GB of memory or more. It needs to be emphasized that while the application allows for inclusion of up to twelve electrodes distributed into one to six groups with variable voltages, the application fundamentally breaks down these groups into anode\u2013cathode pairs and calculates the electric field strength by means of the equations above for every pair. It then searches this set of results to obtain the maximum value of the electric field in each of the 160.000 points. This value represents the final solution in that point, since what we are interested in is determining the maximum value for the local field strength. In this way we have eliminated the need for a solution for the electric field of more than two concurrently active electrodes. Such an approach is justified by the fact that we have already mentioned \u2013 i.e. currently electroporation devices only power two electrodes at the same time.\n\n### Tools and platforms\n\nThe application has been written in C# programming language in the Microsoft\u00ae Visual Studio 2010 integrated development environment. The library used was the Microsoft\u00ae .NET Framework version 4. The development environment and base library have both been selected based on personal preference and possibilities that are enabled by the enhancements in these tools concerning ease of graphical user interface (GUI) development by separating the markup that describes the GUI elements from programming logic that provides the functionality.\n\nThe internet version of the application is hosted on a semi-open platform, since a Microsoft\u00ae Windows operating system is hosting an Apache\u2122 HTTP Server web server with installed PHP support and a free edition of Oracle\u00ae MySQL, providing a web interface to basically the same, though slightly modified and recompiled, engine as in the desktop version.\n\n## Results\n\nThe application that we developed has been named Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation, or ApiVizTEP in short.

Electroporation mainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly composed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short and intense electric fields. The physical mechanism responsible for increased permeability is thought to be the formation of nano-scale defects termed *pores* (thus electro*poration*) in the lipid structure [3, 4]. This allows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact mechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is too high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not temporary, but instead result in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversible electroporation. On the other hand, if the cells survive, increased permeability of membrane is only temporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible electroporation. This observed transient increase in permeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of applications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA) delivery, introduction of drugs into cells, fusion of cells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer, gene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of drugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6, 7] for an overview. In these applications viability of the porated cells is important and thus irreversible electroporation is consciously avoided and generally considered to be an undesired side effect. However, there are also interesting medical applications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering the domains of industrial [9, 10] and environmental [11] applications.\n\n### Electrochemotherapy\n\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that successfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs. For successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate amplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and shape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake and hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been identified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13, 14]. The transport of bleomycin across the nonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited [15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and DNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity of bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several thousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is the electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent increase in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to reach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17, 18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be eradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be permeabilized, i.e. all cells in the tumor have to be exposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means that the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends on both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high electric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we must consider before we can confidently assume we have successfully electroporated the entire tumor area. First, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue electrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity compared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric field strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields in the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue of electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their shape, size and position. In general, there are two types of electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate electrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with either a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two plates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively, which ensures good electrical contact, but has other drawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure good electrical contact and optimal distance between electrodes to fit the tumor [21, 22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous and dependent on their diameter, distance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013 the task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even more arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19, 24] and in vivo studies [25] on importance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need for careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted by a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) project, in the scope of which standard operating procedures for ECT were published [26]. However, in advanced cases such as intracranial [27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need for patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29, 30].\n\n### Non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation and other techniques\n\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation. While the high number of applied pulses used to achieve classical irreversible electroporation may also cause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the current-conducting tissue, non-thermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since it results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and no protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical applications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is technically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of chemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison to other ablation methods such as RF ablation or cryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the connective structure [8, 32]. Since it has been observed that NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves, there is hope of using this technique in treatment of tumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as this treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of ECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure adequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other minimally invasive therapies for treatment of deep-seated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g. high intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation.

When using parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this simple model best approximates the actual field strength far from the electrode edges, provided the electrode width is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results are even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of course there are no parallel plates to speak of (see Figure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore, using the simple parallel plate approximation for *E* in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result in significant reduction of response in treatment for which the complete response rate has been shown to be as high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way into more and more clinics worldwide [36\u201339] and establishing themselves as safe and effective treatments of cancer, it is becoming more and more important that medical personnel performing and planning ECT (or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action, the underlying physics and possible pitfalls.

These contain various model and system settings that we describe here briefly: It is possible to include from two up to twelve needle electrodes in the model that may be distributed into one, two, or more \n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"function_calls>\n<invoke name=\"open\">\n<parameter name=\"urls\" string=\"false\">[\"https:\/\/bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1472-6920-12-102\/metricinvfunction_calls>","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":28262.3558044434,"scoring_ms":384.9241733551,"total_ms":28647.2799777985,"info":{"raw_question":"Identify the title of a 2012 paper published in a BioMed Central journal focused on medical education.

The challenge is to be able to link materials behavior and seek patterns among multiple length and time scales. Materials informatics and statistical learning techniques permit one to survey complex, multiscale information in an accelerated and statistically robust and yet meaningful manner. When this is coupled with advanced tools for computational thermodynamics and kinetic simulations, the result is a powerful computational infrastructure for materials design. This paper provides an overview of the value of this integrated approach to materials modeling in addressing the challenges in linking length scales.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nZ.-K.

This work ventured beyond one dimension, analyzing how quantum probability distributions spread across a plane.\n\nThe study focused on the 'feasible region' and its limiting shape, surprisingly linking it to algebraic geometry. The methods employed relied heavily on analyzing generating functions, echoing approaches refined by a well-regarded probability expert at an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, known for his work in combinatorics and recognized by multiple fellowships (including one bearing the name of a notable mathematician and hedge fund founder).\n\nOne key author on this paper, then affiliated with a major industrial research laboratory in New Jersey famed for its foundational contributions to communications technology, had previously published on diverse topics: applying topological invariants like the Euler characteristic to sensor network problems, comparing congestion patterns in hyperbolic versus Euclidean network models, and exploring geometric relationships involving simplices and Gaussian samples during his earlier research period in Germany.

This issue spurred the development of new remote access protocols. One such intermediate protocol, which verified a user's ability to receive mail before allowing them to send, was itself superseded. This successor protocol, standardizing sender login, is fundamental to the operation of a type of software agent that processes outgoing mail from the user's application, often using a distinct, designated communication channel. This agent, in turn, cooperates with a different agent for the actual routing of messages between various computer systems. While this routing agent functions in the background, the end-user interacts directly with software acting on their behalf.

This issue spurred the development of new remote access protocols. One such intermediate protocol, which verified a user's ability to receive mail before allowing them to send, was itself superseded. This successor protocol, standardizing sender login, is fundamental to the operation of a type of software agent that processes outgoing mail from the user's application, often using a distinct, designated communication channel. This agent, in turn, cooperates with a different agent for the actual routing of messages between various computer systems. While this routing agent functions in the background, the end-user interacts directly with software acting on their behalf. If such user-facing software, exemplified by a web navigation application on a specific model of tablet computer from the early 2010s, transmits an identification string, what particular sequence of characters and numbers, denoting the core rendering engine technology it is built upon, would appear after the details specifying the device and its operating system, but before any mention of compatibility with other rendering engines?"},"answer":"AppleWebKit\/531.21.10","judge_reward_func":1.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.0707893958,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":16.0,"prompt_tokens":139461.0,"completion_tokens":12156.0,"total_tool_calls":15.0}

The molecular pathways whereby some, but not all, cytotoxic agents promote bona fide ICD remain to be fully elucidated. Nevertheless, a central role for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response has been revealed in all scenarios of ICD described thus far. Hence, components of the ER stress machinery may constitute clinically relevant druggable targets for the induction of ICD. In this review, we will summarize recent findings in the field of ICD research with a special focus on ER stress mechanisms and their implication for cancer therapy.\n\n**\nKeywords:\n**\nATP; Anthracyclines; Apoptosis; Calcium; Calreticulin; PERK.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested their effects in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, as representing low and high invasive breast carcinoma, with normal MCF-10A cells. Clonogenicity and proliferation in MCF-7 cells were inhibited more significantly by ponicidin than oridonin, while the reverse was observed in MCF-10A cells. Ponicidin and oridonin induced S\/G2M arrest and G1\/S block in MCF-7 cells. In MCF-10A cells treated with either diterpenoid, induction of apoptosis was observed. Moreover, oridonin almost completely blocked MCF-10A progression from S to G2\/M phase; in contrast, ponicidin-treated MCF-10A cells showed no discernable changes in cell cycle phase distribution. Neither diterpenoid affected growth of MDA-MB-231 cells, at the dose range effective for MCF-7 or MCF-10A cells. Ponicidin-treated MCF-7 cells expressed reduced levels of cyclin B1, cdc2, transcription factor E2F, and Rb including phosphorylation at S780. Less pronounced effects were found in cells treated with oridonin. Neither compound altered cyclin D1 and cdk4 in MCF-7 cells. In MCF-10A cells, oridonin was more active than ponicidin in inhibiting the expression of cyclin B1, cdc2, S780-phosphorylated Rb, and E2F. To further investigate induction of apoptosis in MCF-10A cells, we measured changes in NF-kappaB. Decreases in p65 or p50 forms of NF-kappaB and its upstream regulator I-kappaB were found in oridonin-treated MCF-10A and not MCF-7 cells. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic framework for the cellular effects of ponicidin and oridonin in different stage breast cancer cells.\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## Substances\n\n## Grants and funding\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Full Text Sources\n\n### Medical\n\n### Research Materials\n\n### Miscellaneous","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_806dc9255dcf46abad573e33\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\": [\\\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X05020413\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X05020413\nError fetching https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X05020413: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X05020413'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"function_calls>\n<invoke name=\"parameter name=\"query\" string=\"true\">\"Differential control of growth, cell cycle progression, and expression of NF-kappaBparameter>\n<parameter name=\"num_results\" string=\"false\">10<\/parameter>\n<\/invfunction_calls>","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":0.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":127844.4082736969,"scoring_ms":826.2901306152,"total_ms":128670.6984043121,"info":{"raw_question":"In a 2013 volume of a journal focused on natural medicines from China, a discovery was reported. Originating from the seeds of a West African legume, a novel beta-carboline alkaloid emerged. The investigation, centered at a pharmaceutical university in Nanjing, involved researchers, some of whom would later be associated with institutions in Hubei or specialize further in traditional medicine within Nanjing.

{"example_id":17,"prompt":[{"content":"In the mid-1990s, from a Belgian hub known for both strong theoretical physics and burgeoning interdisciplinary neural studies, came a paper published in a journal dedicated to statistical mechanics. One researcher involved had previously delved into the mathematical landscapes of quantum scattering across dimensions and explored indices tied to supersymmetry. Together with a colleague specializing in neural networks from the same institution, they shifted focus to densely connected systems of continuous-state units. Their investigation explored the intricate 'movements' and potential for unpredictable, non-repeating patterns arising when these units, linked by Hebbian principles, possess activation responses that deviate significantly from the standard smoothed threshold curve.

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

HBTs can provide faster switching speeds than silicon bipolar transistors mainly because of reduced base resistance and collector-to-substrate capacitance.\nQ: What is the difference between HBT and HEMT?\nA: HBTs differ from High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) in material composition, operating principles, and performance characteristics. HBTs, being bipolar devices, generally have higher operating voltages and noise compared to unipolar HEMTs.\nQ: Are all transistors bipolar?\nA: A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals. Transistors are broadly divided into three types: bipolar transistors (bipolar junction transistors: BJTs), field-effect transistors (FETs), and insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs).","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_893cf16eda064195b4482dcf\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"Dubon-Chevallier\\\\\\\" Alexandre 1986\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: A new GaAs\/Ga1\u2212xAlxAs superlattice transistor grown by ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/0022024887904222\nby F Alexandre \u00b7 1987 \u00b7 Cited by 5 \u2014 A new GaAs\/Ga1\u2212xAlxAs superlattice transistor grown by molecular beam epitaxy ; F. \u00b7 Alexandre ; J.C.

Share.\n\n---\n\nPeople Also Ask:\nQ: What is the difference between BJT and heterojunction bipolar transistor?\nA: A heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is a type of bipolar junction transistor (BJT) that uses different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions, creating a heterojunction. The HBT improves on the BJT in that it can handle signals of very high frequencies, up to several hundred GHz.\nQ: When was the bipolar transistor invented?\nA: The bipolar point-contact transistor was invented in December 1947 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain under the direction of William Shockley. The junction version, known as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), was invented by Shockley in 1948.\nQ: What is an HBT amplifier?\nA: Technology (InGaP HBT) Broadband High Linearity Amplifier. The MMG3006NT1 is a general purpose amplifier that is internally input prematched and designed for a broad range of Class A, small--signal, high linearity, general purpose applications.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_e910e342f1484476912761d5\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"West Germany\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"heterojunction bipolar\\\\\\\" 1987 conference paper\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: 3.4 GHz silicon bipolar versatile shift register and 6.8 Gbit\/s ...\nURL: https:\/\/digital-library.theiet.org\/doi\/10.1049\/el%3A19900360\nby B W\u00fcppermann \u00b7 1990 \u00b7 Cited by 1 \u2014 2.

This particular study diverged from isolating natural variants; instead, it detailed the *chemical alteration* of surfactin through the targeted addition of simple alkyl ester moieties. The investigation characterized the resulting products, assessed how these modifications impacted surface activity and cell-lysing potential, and explored the altered affinity for certain divalent cations.

This particular study diverged from isolating natural variants; instead, it detailed the *chemical alteration* of surfactin through the targeted addition of simple alkyl ester moieties. The investigation characterized the resulting products, assessed how these modifications impacted surface activity and cell-lysing potential, and explored the altered affinity for certain divalent cations. The work appeared in a journal bridging biotechnology with applied biochemistry, and involved contributions from teams associated with a Lyon university named for a famed physiologist and experts linked to a national center focused on natural substances chemistry."},"answer":"Selective Esterification of Surfactin - Preparation and Properties of Surfactin Methyl-Esters","judge_reward_func":0.0,"redundancy_penalty_func":0.1051377218,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":8.0,"prompt_tokens":29218.0,"completion_tokens":1015.0,"total_tool_calls":7.0}

Each of these mutations changes one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in the HFE protein.\nQ: What is a common early laboratory marker of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)?\nA: Your doctor will order a blood test to check for a high concentration of iron. Blood tests include: Serum ferritin: This test measures the amount of iron stored in the liver. Levels can be very high in hemochromatosis.\nQ: What are the diseases associated with HFE?\nA: HFE HC has been described as bronze diabetes with cirrhosis, primary hemochromatosis, genetic hemochromatosis, hereditary hemochromatosis, and hemochromatosis type 1.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_7c0e87b41b4341cc86303be5\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"HFE interaction with transferrin receptor author University of Michigan\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, interaction with ...\nURL: https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/16893896\/\nby T Goswami \u00b7 2006 \u00b7 Cited by 476 \u2014 Hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, interaction with transferrin receptor 2 suggests a molecular mechanism for mammalian iron sensing.Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Interaction of the Hereditary Hemochromatosis Protein ...\nURL: https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC2673483\/\nby J Gao \u00b7 2009 \u00b7 Cited by 420 \u2014 HFE has several binding partners that could participate in iron homeostasis.

Four of these, composed between the late 1930s and early 1940s, were published in 1980, four after Britten's death: 'Tell me the Truth About Love', 'Funeral Blues', 'Johnny' and 'Calypso'.\nQ: What was Benjamin Britten's most famous piece?\nA: Perhaps most notably, Britten composed his War Requiem (1962) for the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral; this poignant anti-war masterpiece remains as one of the greatest choral works of the twentieth century.\nQ: Who was Benjamin Britten's lover?\nA: Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears were together from 1939 until Britten's death in 1976. Yet during Britten's lifetime, neither spoke publicly about their relationship or sexuality. In some ways, this is hardly surprising given that homosexuality was illegal until it was partially decriminalised in 1967.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_2b6b847461af4b74b15ca395\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"Freies Wort newspaper\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Freies Wort - Wikipedia\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Freies_Wort\nFreies Wort is the largest regional newspaper in southern Thuringia.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger\u2019s causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nStroke is the second-leading cause of death and a major cause disability worldwide (Feigin, 2021) and, in particular, ischemic stroke constituted 62.4% of all new strokes in 2019. Focal stroke lesions affecting either cortical and sub-cortical neurons or descending fiber tracts may affect the neural processing in the motor network (Ward and Cohen, 2004; Stinear et al., 2007). This leads to motor deficit, mainly caused by hemiparesis, that is one of the most common stroke-related disabilities (Katan and Luft, 2018). Nevertheless, it has been observed that patients with initially mild to moderate motor impairments may show substantial recovery of the motor function within the first 3 months after stroke onset. This may be driven by neural plasticity and reorganization, which can occur in the brain also far from the lesion site (Nudo, 2006; Cramer, 2008; Rehme and Grefkes, 2013).\n\nTo investigate cortical functional reorganization, connectivity models based on the concept that the brain is organized in specialized anatomically distinct areas functionally integrated in networks (Friston, 2002) were applied to neuroimaging techniques, both in experimental and computational simulation studies (Falcon et al., 2016; Allegra Mascaro et al., 2020). Functional connectivity is usually inferred by means of correlations among measurements of neuronal activity neglecting information on the coupling direction, whereas the directed functional connectivity investigates the causal influence that a brain region exerts over another (Friston, 2011; Barrett and Barnett, 2013). In the literature, the analysis of cortical directed and undirected functional connectivity has been extensively used to characterize the brain connections and investigate rehabilitation effects on patients after stroke events (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Connectivity studies can be carried out during both task and resting state conditions, the latter being the easiest protocol executable also for patients in the acute stage. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that changes in resting state connectivity, especially in the motor network, are predictive of motor function recovery in stroke patients (James et al., 2009; Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Volz et al., 2016; Hordacre et al., 2020).\n\nAmong neuroimaging techniques, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was one of the first employed to investigate brain connectivity. Given its high spatial resolution and the provided volumetric information, fMRI allows investigation of connections involving both cortical and deep structures in the brain (Farr and Wegener, 2010). Electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed as a valid alternative technique, as it allowed to reconstruct known resting state networks from signals acquired by scalp electrodes in healthy subjects (Mantini et al., 2007). Despite its lower spatial resolution, EEG offers a higher time resolution with respect to fMRI, allowing to better track the fast reconfiguration of neuronal networks and to extract information on the spectral characteristics of the functional networks related to specific brain rhythms. Moreover, it exploits cheaper and portable instrumentation, allowing measurements both on healthy and pathological subjects, also accessible in complex medical setting (Borich et al., 2015).\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, a plethora of measures and indexes have been proposed to infer both functional and causal connectivity from EEG recordings (Pereda et al., 2005), including bivariate and conditional Granger causality (GC), transfer entropy (TE), directed transfer function (DTF), directed coherence (DC), partial directed coherence (PDC) and dynamical Bayesian inference. Each of these metrics may be sensitive to different aspects of the neurophysiological data, evidenced either in time or frequency domains or through linear or non-linear relationships. Therefore, the choice of a metric over another depends on the particular aspect of interest in the connectivity network; moreover, the reliability of a specific metric can depend on different factors related to the specific application, such as the stationarity of the signal, non-linear effects or indirect connections among networks nodes. Different causal connectivity metrics can lead to different results and careful interpretation is required. Usually, only one metric is chosen to retrieve networks\u2019 topology and infer the spectral content of the information flow between network nodes. However, the use of a single metric cannot guarantee a comprehensive description of the network (Blinowska, 2011). For instance, GC and TE provide compact information on the overall information flow between network nodes, while DTF, DC and PDC focus on specific rhythms of physiological interest (Sameshima and Baccal\u00e1, 2014; Seth et al., 2015); bivariate GC\/TE and DC detect the overall flow of information from one node to another, while conditional GC\/TE and DTF\/PDC elicit direct connections but may lose ability to capture the coupling strength (Faes et al., 2012). Finally, the dynamical Bayesian inference approach has been proposed to assess the cross-frequency coupling strength both in neural networks and among different physiological systems, e.g., cardio-respiratory-cortical interactions (Stankovski et al., 2016). Until now, an agreed standard measure to assess EEG-based causal connectivity is not univocally employed in the literature, and the selection of the most appropriate measure still represents an open issue.\n\nMoreover, in the context of EEG analysis, causal connectivity was often identified directly from the electrodes signal, but it has been demonstrated that connectivity computed in the electrode space is affected by the scalp volume-conduction effect and the obtained results can be hardly interpreted as real brain connectivity (Hassan and Wendling, 2018; Marinazzo et al., 2019; Van de Steen et al., 2019). On the contrary, meaningful connectivity patterns can be derived from cortical source activities extracted from EEG inverse solutions (Michel and Murray, 2012; Haufe et al., 2013).\n\nAlthough the effects of stroke on resting-state brain connectivity have been widely investigated, especially in the acute phase with respect to healthy subjects, a limited number of works focused specifically on longitudinal effects of motor rehabilitation on the reorganization of the cortical motor network after stroke. Moreover, the majority of studies exploited fMRI to assess functional, non-directed connectivity (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Considering EEG analysis, up to now, the majority of studies explored functional connectivity in post-stroke populations in both acute (Caliandro et al., 2017; Vecchio et al., 2019a, 2019b; Fanciullacci et al., 2021; Hoshino et al., 2021) and chronic stages (Gerloff et al., 2006; De Vico Fallani et al., 2009, 2017; Wu et al., 2015; Hordacre et al., 2020; Molteni et al., 2020; Waterstone et al., 2020; Romeo et al., 2021); only fewer studies investigated the resting-state causal connectivity after stroke (Guo et al., 2014; Pichiorri et al., 2015, 2018; Calabr\u00f2 et al., 2018; Nicolo et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021). The few studies cited above employing EEG rarely focused on the investigation of the motor network, preferring a large-scale connectivity analysis of the whole brain with synthetic descriptors. Even though this type of information can serve as a general indication on the state of brain\u2019s connections after stroke, information about power spectral strength or flow direction in the identified connections are often missing. This type of information can be obtained by separate connectivity metrics computed from electrodes or brain sources signals and whose underlying interpretation should be carefully considered to compare the results between different studies.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, the investigation of motor network directed functional connectivity by means of EEG in sub-acute stroke patients should be deepened from both methodological and application perspectives. To this aim, in this work we perform an EEG-based longitudinal study of resting-state causal connectivity in a population of sub-acute stroke patients with motor impairment who underwent a rehabilitation treatment. We focus on the characterization of the motor network exploiting the cortical source signals reconstructed from EEG scalp recordings and using two different connectivity metrics, i.e., the Directed Coherence (DC) and the generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Combining the information carried by these two measures, we aim to provide a description of the variations induced by treatment in both the topography and the transfer of spectral power along the identified functional connections, investigating also possible correlations with the clinical assessment of motor recovery.\n\nIn Section 2, a detailed description of the participants enrolled for this study and the methodology followed is presented. In Section 3, the obtained results are reported and their discussion can be found in Section 4. Section 5 draws conclusions of the work.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1 Population Description\n\nEighteen subjects (age 67 \u00b1 10, seven females and 11 males) in the sub-acute stage after ischemic stroke were enrolled for this study. Inclusion criteria were age less than 80 years old, first unilateral stroke, distance from acute event less than 30 days, with no other concomitant orthopedic or rheumatologic disease, without global or comprehension aphasia, right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. Each subject was evaluated twice: firstly, at the admission to the rehabilitation center (T0, on average after 12 \u00b1 5 days from the stroke event) and secondly at the end of the rehabilitation treatment (T1, on average after 55 \u00b1 11 days from the event). In Table 1, details about participants\u2019 characteristics are reported. To participate, each subject signed a written informed consent. The study was reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee \u201cComitato Etico Provinciale dell\u2019Insubria\u201d and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nPatients followed a rehabilitation treatment for both upper and lower limb recovery: each patient underwent to a rehabilitation treatment twice per day, each session lasting 45 min. Training was tailored according to patients\u2019 residuals motor capacity and it included exercise for upper and lower limbs. Lower and upper limbs stretching, lower and upper limbs muscle strengthening, static and dynamic balance exercises, proprioception exercises, trunk control exercise, gait at the parallel bars or in clinical open spaces were the exercise performed.\n\n### 2.2 Functional Assessment\n\nClinical evaluations were performed by clinicians, i.e., physiotherapist and medical doctor. To assess the upper limb performance the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) (Fugl-Meyer et al., 1975) before and after treatment was used. The FMA motor score ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 66 (upper limb normal motor performance). As for the lower limb, the level of walking ability was assessed by the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC). This gait assessment scale distinguishes six levels of walking ability based on the amount of physical support required. The lowest level 0 indicates a patient who is not able to walk, while level 5, indicates a patient who can walk everywhere independently, including stairs (Holden et al., 1984). Participants\u2019 scores assigned at T0 and T1 for both clinical scales, i.e., FMAT0, FMAT1, FAC T0 and FAC T1, are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe variations \u0394FMA = FMAT1\u2013FMAT0 and \u0394FAC = FACT1\u2013FACT0 was considered as primary clinical outcomes of subject\u2019s motor recovery.\n\n### 2.3 EEG Data Acquisition\n\nResting state EEG recordings were performed with the Neuroscan system (Compumedics Neuroscan, Compumedics, NC, United States) using 64 Ag\/AgCl electrodes placed according to the International 10\/20 standard system. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz, with the reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz positions and the ground electrode positioned anterior to Fz. During the acquisition, patients were asked to keep their eyes closed in a sitting relaxed position for at least 5 min. As for functional assessment, EEG recordings were repeated twice, before (T0) and after (T1) the rehabilitation treatment.\n\n### 2.4 EEG Data Analysis\n\nIn Figure 1, a scheme of the principal steps followed for the analysis of single EEG recordings is reported. Three main stages can be identified: EEG signal pre-processing, current sources reconstruction and directed functional connectivity. In the scheme, inputs and outputs of each block are highlighted. Detailed explanation of each step is provided in the following sections.\n\n**FIGURE 1**. Pipeline of single acquisition and analysis. Abbreviations: MVAR, multivariate auto-regressive; DC, Directed Coherence; gPDC, generalized partial directed coherence.\n\n##### 2.4.1 EEG Pre-Processing\n\nEEG signals were pre-processed offline in Matlab environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) using the open source EEGLab signal processing Toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).\n\nData were down-sampled at 128 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 45 Hz to remove slow drifts and high-frequency components, such as the power line noise. Flat and \u201cbad\u201d channels were removed for further analysis. A flat channel was identified if it showed amplitude around zero (flatline) for more than 5 s consecutively, whereas a channel was identified as \u201cbad\u201d if it was noisy for more than 90% of the acquisition duration. An Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm (Mullen et al., 2015) was applied to all retained channels to identify and remove transient or high-amplitude artifacts, e.g., eye movements. According to Chang and others (Chang et al., 2020), the application of this cleaning approach improves the accuracy of subsequent Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The ASR algorithm automatically identifies clean periods of the EEG data using a sliding window. An artifact rejection threshold is calculated, based on the calibration signal distribution of variance and a user-defined cut-off parameter. Data portions, whose variance is larger than this threshold, are removed and reconstructed from neighboring channels using a covariance matrix computed from the calibration data. According to the cut-off parameter *k* chosen by the user, the method can be more or less aggressive in removing EEG components portions of data. In this work, *k* = 20 was employed, according to the range suggested by Chang and others, who validated the ASR method on real EEG data and found that a *k* in the range 10\u2013100 allows removing ocular artifacts still preserving cerebral components (Chang et al., 2020). Furthermore, ICA was applied to the ASR-cleaned EEG recordings exploiting the RUNICA Infomax algorithm as implemented in EEGLab (Makeig and Bell, 1996). RUNICA un-mixes the EEG recordings in cortical and non-cortical spatially distinct and temporally independent components (IC). Once the non-cortical components are identified and removed, the final cleaned EEG signal can be reconstructed. To guide the selection of ICs accounting for non-brain (artifactual) activities the ICLabel plugin was employed (Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019). It is an automated classifier which provides an estimation of the type of each of the IC (brain, eye, muscle, line noise, etc.) based on some component characteristics, i.e., power spectrum, its time-course, topography dipole localization and percentage data variance accounted in the considered component. A final visual check of the signals was performed. The originally removed \u201cbad\u201d channels were then reconstructed by the interpolation of the neighbor channels signals, thus obtaining a uniform EEG spatial sampling. Finally, EEG data were re-referenced to a common average reference and 1 min of cleaned, artifact-free 60 channels EEG was selected for all subjects.\n\n##### 2.4.2 Individual Alpha Frequency\n\nTo improve the accuracy of the EEG analysis in the frequency domain, the interindividual variability of the alpha rhythm peak was considered for the determination of the spectral bands of interest, as proposed by Klimesch in 1999 (Klimesch, 1999). In particular, for the purpose of this study, we focused our analysis on alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands, which are reported as the most involved in motor system functions (Pfurtscheller et al., 1994, 1996). After computing the power spectral density (PSD) for the parieto-occipital channels by the Welch method (Welch, 1967), the Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF) was determined as the average peak position in the spectral range 7.5\u201312.5 Hz. The average IAF found in our population was equal to 9.07 \u00b1 0.99 Hz. The IAF was used to define the alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands as follow: \u03b1 = [IAF-2 Hz \u00f7 IAF+2 Hz] and \u03b2 = [IAF+2.5 Hz \u00f7 IA\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_9980fbee4018452abf9ce717\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\": [\\\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35450158\/\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35450158\/\n# Resting State EEG Directed Functional Connectivity Unveils Changes in Motor Network Organization in Subacute Stroke Patients After Rehabilitation\n\n-\nPMID:\n**35450158** - PMCID: PMC9016279\n- DOI: 10.3389\/fphys.2022.862207\n\n# Resting State EEG Directed Functional Connectivity Unveils Changes in Motor Network Organization in Subacute Stroke Patients After Rehabilitation\n\n## Abstract\n\nBrain plasticity and functional reorganization are mechanisms behind functional motor recovery of patients after an ischemic stroke. The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger's causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n\n**\nKeywords:\n**\nEEG; brain sources; causal connectivity; directed coherence; motor network; partial direct coherence; stroke; subacute.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Pirovano, Mastropietro, Antonacci, Bar\u00e0, Guanziroli, Molteni, Faes and Rizzo.\n\n## Conflict of interest statement\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n## Figures\n\n## References\n\n-\n- Allegra Mascaro A.

Using resting-state EEG, it delves into the *directed* functional connections within the motor network of patients in the subacute stage, post-rehabilitation. The investigation highlights changes in information flow by employing and comparing two frequency-domain measures designed to assess causal influence, differentiating direct pathways from mediated ones, particularly within alpha and beta rhythms. The research team brought together expertise from Italy's national research council, university departments spanning the mainland to Sicily, and a dedicated rehabilitation facility. Among the authors is a female figure prominent in Italian biomedical research, whose background includes foundational work on autonomic nervous system signals derived from ECG, as well as contributions to sophisticated neuroimaging analyses involving diffusion techniques and magnetization transfer, sometimes collaborating with London-based institutions.

The show consisted of 72 episodes, ranging from five to seven minutes in length. The series ended on August 23, 2014 and has accumulated over 3 million views on the Pemberley Digital YouTube channel.\n\n[2]On September 19, 2018, a video featuring Sotomura and Bailey as Emma and Alex announced that a continuation of the series would be starting in October 2018. Due to lack of funding raised from online sources \u2013 such as GoFundMe \u2013 the sequel series ended after just seventeen episodes, with the new story left incomplete.\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]The series focuses on the life of Emma Woodhouse and takes place at the offices of her eponymous lifestyle company, Emma Approved, an all-in-one lifestyle coaching, matchmaking, and event planning company. Emma decides to document her business successes (to the chagrin of her business partner Alex Knightley). Alex forces Emma to hire an assistant: Harriet Smith. When best friend Annie Taylor announces she wants to call off her wedding to Emma Approved client Ryan Weston, Harriet and Emma convince Ryan's step-brother Frank Churchill to send a wedding gift because he can\u2019t make it and the wedding is back on.\n\nHarriet has a crush on Emma Approved's IT guy Bobby Martin, but Emma doesn\u2019t approve the match and thinks Harriet can do better. Emma plans to set Harriet up with Emma Approved's newest client, Senator James Elton, but he likes Emma and thinks Harriet is below him. Elton leaves Emma Approved as a client when Emma rebuffs him. Emma takes a break from the company. When she returns, Izzy Knightley arrives, Emma's sister and Alex's sister-in-law. Turns out, Izzy isn\u2019t feeling heard by her husband John. Emma's meddling almost breaks the couple up, but eventually Izzy reveals what she really wants: to go back to school. Meanwhile, Harriet starts a music club (playing ukulele).\n\nAlex finds Emma's next client: Maddy Bates, whose accounting business is struggling. Emma decides to throw an elite fundraiser in order for Maddy gain more clients, and Frank Churchill arrives to help. Senator Elton returns to ask Emma Approved to plan his engagement party to Caroline Lee. Hating the experience with the Eltons, Emma decides to change the direction of the company and focus on high-profile charity causes. They hire Jane Fairfax to help, Maddy Bates\u2019 niece and Emma's self-identified rival. They put together a Bachelor\/Bachelorette Auction for human rights as their first cause.\n\nEmma decides to throw a baby shower for Annie at the same time that Emma Approved gets another benefit: the opening of Boxx, a celebrity-led restaurant. Emma gets too distracted by the Boxx Hill event and ends up missing most of Annie's baby shower. Though the event is a success, Emma's and Frank's behavior toward Maddy and her homemade preserves in front of the celebrity guests at the opening event disgusts Jane and Alex, who both leave the company.\n\nEmma apologizes to Maddy, and then to Annie, who reveals Frank and Jane were secretly together and that Frank sold his company. When Emma tells Harriet, Harriet tells Emma that she likes Alex. Emma realizes she has feelings for Alex, and apologizes once and for all to Bobby Martin for pushing him away from Harriet. Alex returns to Emma Approved and confesses to Emma that he is in love with her. They kiss. Emma approaches Harriet with the news that she and Alex are now together. Harriet reveals she still has feelings for Bobby Martin. She and Emma organize a surprise for him, and Harriet and Bobby kiss.\n\nThe second series opens five years later; Emma is slipping back to her less-confident self after the failed engagement of Anne Elliot and Mr. Wentworth. The company is overburdened with going public, and a full documentary crew is filming their progress. Alex approaches Emma with a new client for her to focus on: Ricky Collins.\n\n## Format\n\n[edit]The story is told in a vlog-style format from the point of view of the eponymous character, Emma Woodhouse. Each episode is between four and eight minutes. The show takes place entirely in the Emma Approved offices, where there are cameras set up in Emma's office and at Alex's, Harriet's and Jane's desks. Emma also speaks with clients and colleagues through video chat.\n\nA second channel under Emma's full name includes supplementary videos to the main story. These videos include Harriet's initial application video to become Emma's assistant, a series of six question and answer videos featuring various cast members, a video by Martin confessing to Harriet that he likes her, and Harriet's Music Club videos which she starts after episode 32, though her first \"song\" (for Senator James Elton) appears after episode 21.\n\nAfter episode 67, a short series following Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax's flirting in the office (comprising nine under-two-minute episodes) was released entitled \"Frank and Jane\" on the main channel.\n\n## Characters\n\n[edit]**Emma Woodhouse**(Joanna Sotomura) is an ambitious, confident lifestyle coach, event planner and match maker. She believes that she's going to be the next Oprah, and so begins documenting her \"greatness\" for when she becomes famous. She starts out the series self-centered and oblivious to her own extremely privileged perspective, but grows to see her own shortcomings. Though she is often misguided, she has a big heart and is always trying to do what's best for the people around her. She has several catchphrases, like calling things \"Emma approved\" and asserting she's going to \"make your life better.\"**Alex Knightley**(Brent Bailey;*George Knightley*in the novel) is Emma's business partner and head of finance for Emma Approved. He is the voice of reason in Emma's life and shows her extreme patience. Emma often teases him for his poor sense of style, but he's able to tease her right back with his characteristic snark. Alex spends much of the series struggling to hide his romantic feelings for Emma.**Harriet Smith**(Dayeanne Hutton) is Emma's new assistant. She has a degree in library science and hopes to be a lifestyle expert like Emma. Harriet is extremely good hearted, if a little ditzy. Emma spends a lot of the series trying to mold Harriet in her own image, only to find that Harriet is best when she's being herself.**Bobby Martin**(James Brent Isaacs;*Robert Martin*in the novel) is Emma Approved's sweet and bumbling IT guy. He has feelings for Harriet, but Emma disapproves of the match and convinces Harriet to reject his advances. He enjoys bird-watching and poker and goes by the nickname B-Mart.**Frank Churchill**(Stephen A. Chang) is a high-profile entrepreneur who is constantly jetsetting to other countries to do business. Emma often relies on his celebrity and money to pull her out of trouble. He is boyish and charming and seems to have natural chemistry with Emma.**Jane Fairfax**(Tyra Colar) is an old friend of Emma's family. Since she is so successful and close in age to Emma, Emma feels a natural rivalry with Jane. Later in the series, Jane joins Emma Approved to help organize charity-related events.**Annie Taylor**(Alexis Boozer;*Anne Taylor*in the novel) is Emma's best friend. Emma has helped orchestrate all the major events in Annie's life, from meeting her future husband to her wedding day to her baby shower.**James Elton**(Paul Stuart;*Philip Elton*in the novel) is a California senator who comes to Emma to find him a match.**Ryan Weston**(Gabriel Voss;*Mr. Weston*in the novel) is a cupcake mogul and one of Emma's matchmaking clients. Emma matches him with Annie Taylor. They are happily married and expecting a child.**Izzy Knightley**(Mapuana Makia;*Isabella Knightley*in the novel) is Emma's older sister who is married to Alex's brother. She is a housewife with two kids, but is unhappy and restless. Emma helps her realize that she wants to go back to school.**Maddy Bates**(Nikea Gamby-Turner;*Miss Bates*in the novel) is a close friend of Emma's family and Jane Fairfax's aunt. Emma helps her find clients for her financial consulting business. Maddy makes jams in her spare time and likes nothing better than talking about Jane.**Caroline Lee**(Jessica Andres) is crossover role from*The Lizzie Bennet Diaries*. She replaces Augusta Hawkins in the original novel. Caroline is James Elton's new fianc\u00e9. Emma helps the couple plan their engagement party.\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]Initial response to Pemberley's Emma character was mixed due to her tendency toward \"unlikable\"[3] self-confidence and large ego, though the first two episodes garnered over 120,000 views in the show's first week.[4] By early January (three months into the series), Emma had won over her audience with her caring for those around her.[5] Emma Approved's viewership was only about 80% that of Pemberley's predecessor series *The Lizzie Bennet Diaries,*[6] but unlike that series, all of Emma's transmedia storytelling was monetized using brand integration including companies such as Modcloth and Samsung.[6]\n\nThe romantic leads, Joanna Sotomura and Brent Bailey, gained some attention for becoming a real couple during the run of the show, leading to their own fan following and the portmanteau \"Brentanna.\"[7]\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\n[edit]| Year | Award | Category | Result | Nominee(s) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 2014 | ||||\nIAWTV Awards[8] |\nBest Comedy Series | Nominated | ||\n| Best Female Performance: Comedy | Nominated | Joanna Sotomura | ||\n| Best Ensemble Cast | Nominated | |||\nStreamy Awards[9] |\nAudience Choice | Finalist | ||\n| Best Actress in a Comedy | Nominated | Joanna Sotomura | ||\n| Best Actor in a Comedy | Nominated | Brent Bailey | ||\nCynopsis Digital Model D Awards[10] |\nWeb Series Comedy | Nominated | ||\n| 2015 | Creative Arts Emmy Award | Outstanding Original Interactive Program[11] |\nWon | Bernie Su, Tamara Krinsky, Alexandra Edwards, Tracy Bitterolf, Kate Rorick |\n\n## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a**\"Lizzie Bennet Diaries companion Emma Approved debuts today\".

The performance of the patients was compared with that of a control group consisting of eight subjects with no history of neurological deficits.\n\n**\nResults:\n**\nPatients with neglect as well as patients clinically recovered from neglect showed aberrant search performance in the virtual reality (VR) task, such as mixed search pattern, repeated target pressures and deviating hand movements.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 20,025.[1] Its county seat is Fairmont.[2]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The county was created by the Minnesota Territory legislature on May 23, 1857, with Fair Mount (which was also platted in 1857) designated as county seat. The town's name was later shortened to Fairmont. Two explanations have been advanced for the county's name. A delegate to the US Congress from the Wisconsin Territory, Morgan Lewis Martin, introduced the legislative act to organize the Minnesota Territory. But in 1904 the county's oldest residents attested that the name referred to Henry Martin, an early settler from Connecticut who ran several businesses during the pre-territory era.[3][4]\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]Martin County lies on Minnesota's border with Iowa. The East Fork of the Des Moines River flows southeastward through the lower western part of the county. The county terrain consists of low rolling hills, dotted with lakes and ponds, completely devoted to agriculture where possible.[5] The terrain slopes to the east and north, with its highest point near its southwest corner, at 1,407 ft (429 m) ASL.[6] The county has an area of 730 square miles (1,900 km2), of which 712 square miles (1,840 km2) is land and 17 square miles (44 km2) (2.4%) is water.[7]\n\n### Major highways\n\n[edit]### Airports\n\n[edit]### Adjacent counties\n\n[edit]- Watonwan County - north\n- Blue Earth County - northeast\n- Faribault County - east\n- Kossuth County, Iowa - southeast\n- Emmet County, Iowa - southwest\n- Jackson County - west\n\n### Protected areas\n\n[edit]Source:[5]\n\n- Ceylon State Wildlife Management Area\n- Fox Lake Refuge\n- Luedtke State Wildlife Management Area\n- Perch Creek State Wildlife Management Area\n- State Wildlife Management Area\n- Truman Wildlife Area\n\n### Lakes\n\n[edit]Source:[5]\n\n- Amber Lake\n- Big Twin Lake\n- Bright Lake\n- Budd Lake\n- Buffalo Lake (Cedar Township)\n- Buffalo Lake (Rutland Township)\n- Canright Lake\n- Cedar Lake\n- Clam Lake\n- Clayton Lake\n- Clear Lake\n- Creek Lake\n- Eagle Lake\n- East Chain Lake\n- Fish Lake (Cedar Township)\n- Fish Lake (Lake Belt Township)\n- Fox Lake\n- Hall Lake\n- High Lake\n- Iowa Lake (part)\n- Kiester Lake\n- Lake Charlotte\n- Lake George\n- Lake Imogene\n- Lake Seymour\n- Little Hat Lake\n- Little Twin Lake\n- Martin Lake\n- Mud Lake\n- Murphy Lake\n- North Lake\n- North Silver Lake\n- Okamanpeedan Lake (part)\n- Perch Lake\n- Pierce Lake\n- Rose Lake\n- Round Lake (Fox Lake Township)\n- Round Lake (Waverly Township)\n- Sager Lakes\n- Sisseton Lake\n- South Silver Lake\n- Susan Lake\n- Temperance Lake\n- Tuttle Lake\n- Watkins Lake\n- Wilmert Lake\n\n## Demographics\n\n[edit]| Census | Pop. | Note | %\u00b1 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1860 | 151 | \u2014 | |\n| 1870 | 3,867 | 2,460.9% | |\n| 1880 | 5,249 | 35.7% | |\n| 1890 | 9,408 | 79.2% | |\n| 1900 | 16,936 | 80.0% | |\n| 1910 | 17,518 | 3.4% | |\n| 1920 | 21,085 | 20.4% | |\n| 1930 | 22,401 | 6.2% | |\n| 1940 | 24,656 | 10.1% | |\n| 1950 | 25,655 | 4.1% | |\n| 1960 | 26,986 | 5.2% | |\n| 1970 | 24,316 | \u22129.9% | |\n| 1980 | 24,687 | 1.5% | |\n| 1990 | 22,914 | \u22127.2% | |\n| 2000 | 21,802 | \u22124.9% | |\n| 2010 | 20,840 | \u22124.4% | |\n| 2020 | 20,025 | \u22123.9% | |\n| 2024 (est.) | 19,561 | [9] | \u22122.3% |\nU.S. Decennial Census[10]1790-1960 [11] 1900-1990[12]1990-2000 [13] 2010-2020[1] |\n\n### 2020 Census\n\n[edit]| Race | Num. | Perc. |\n|---|---|---|\n| White (NH) | 17,947 | 89.62% |\n| Black or African American (NH) | 112 | 0.6% |\n| Native American (NH) | 32 | 0.16% |\n| Asian (NH) | 92 | 0.46% |\n| Pacific Islander (NH) | 6 | 0.03% |\n| Other\/Mixed (NH) | 516 | 2.6% |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 1,320 | 6.6% |\n\n### 2000 census\n\n[edit]As of the census of 2000, there were 21,802 people, 9,067 households, and 6,047 families in the county.

The balloons were launched mainly from land; however, some were also launched from *Vulcano*. The Austrians used smaller pilot balloons to determine the correct fuse settings. At least one bomb fell in the city; however, due to the wind changing after launch, most of the balloons missed their target, and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship *Vulcano*.[14][15][16] On 4 July, she had run aground at Malamocco and come under fire from Manfrin Fort. A crew member was killed. She was damaged at her paddlebox. *Vulcan* was refloated the next day with assistance from SMS *Custoza* (1848) and the Austrian steamships *Curtatone* and *Dorotea*.[17]\n\n## Subsequent Service\n\n[edit]In September 1869, a boiler explosion killed eleven of her crew and severely injured many more.[18] On 17 November 1869, she was one of seventy ships, all of which drew less than 13 feet of water, that sailed through the Suez Canal in a procession marking the opening of the canal.[19]\n\nShe remained in service until 1872, and finally struck in 1884 to become a coal hulk.[1]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b****c****d****e**The Influence of Air Power Upon History, Walter J.

It essentially doubles the power transmission capacity compared to a monopolar link.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_d1ba6aaa352844a5a4f598a0\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\": [\\\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electrode_line\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electrode_line\n# Electrode line\n\nAn **electrode line** is used in some high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) power transmission systems, to connect the converter stations to distant ground electrodes. Many long-distance HVDC systems use sea or ground return for the DC neutral current since this is considerably cheaper than providing a dedicated *metallic return* conductor on an overhead wire or cable. The ground electrode is separated from the converter station so that current returning through the ground electrode does not cause corrosion of parts of the station in contact with the earth.\n\n## Ground connection\n\n[edit]The connection to ground requires a specially designed *ground electrode* (or *earth electrode*).[1][2] The electrode is usually located several tens of kilometres from the converter station in order to avoid possible problems or corrosion in the converter station grounding system. [3] The **electrode line** connects the converter station to the grounding electrode. The electrode line can be implemented, depending upon the location of the electrode (onshore or in the sea), as ground cables, as overhead line, or as a combination of ground cable and overhead line.\n\n## Bipolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are used in most bipolar thyristor-based line-commutated converter (LCC) HVDC transmission systems as a means to improve the reliability of the entire system while also reducing the DC voltage and current ripples. In the event that one of the poles in the bipolar system is faulted, the current path will switch to ground return, thus allowing the system to continue operating at reduced capacity and reducing the possibility that a pole fault will cause a bipolar outage. Usually these ground return paths are only used for very short durations until the faulted pole can be returned to service. The ground current in such schemes can flow in either direction, so the electrodes have to be designed to be reversible, operating either as an anode or cathode. Concerning voltage-source-converter (VSC) HVDC systems, the main reason to use bipolar configurations, especially when the pole-to-pole DC voltages approach 1 MV, is because when one line is faulted in a monopolar HVDC system, the AC phase-to-ground voltages experience peak voltages twice that of normal operation, calling for double the galvanic isolation that is need for normal operation.\n\n## Monopolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are also used in some monopolar HVDC systems, for example the Italy\u2013Corsica\u2013Sardinia scheme.[4] In such systems the electrode line permanently carries the same current as the high-voltage conductor; however since the ground current is then only unidirectional, one of the electrodes (the cathode) can be of simpler design since corrosion is not a problem for cathode electrodes.\n\n## Typical voltages\n\n[edit]The operating voltage of the electrode line usually is in the range of approx. 10-20kV (medium voltage range).[5]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**Arrillaga, Jos; High Voltage Direct Current Transmission, second edition, Institution of Electrical Engineers, ISBN 0 85296 941 4, 1998, pp190\u2013192.**^**Kimbark, E.W., Direct current transmission, volume 1, Wiley Interscience, 1971, chapter 9.**^**M.V.Bakshi U.A.Bakshi,*Elements Of Power Systems*, Technical Publications, 2009, ISBN 8184312679 page 12-26**^**Compendium of HVDC schemes, CIGR\u00c9 Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987.**^**Padiyar, K.

This entity established a subsidiary specializing in solar electricity, a field rapidly advancing in a major South Asian nation which notably utilizes building summits for energy capture. These summit-based energy installations are photovoltaic systems that often channel surplus electricity into the broader power grid. A critical electronic device in these grid-integrated setups is responsible for converting the panel's direct current output into alternating current. On a much larger scale, similar current conversion technology is employed in systems designed for bulk power transmission over extensive distances using direct current at very high potentials. Such long-distance systems, which operate with this non-alternating current to reduce energy loss, may, in certain configurations (especially those with a single main conductor), use a specific type of conductor to link to an earth grounding point.

The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting.

This work, involving researchers including one often associated with high-voltage studies and apparatus diagnostics, addresses a critical challenge in power system monitoring: how to precisely measure waveform components beyond the fundamental, especially when the system's core frequency fluctuates significantly, staying within bounds acknowledged by recent standards. The method employs a refined, adaptive technique leveraging principles related to Fourier analysis for evolving signals.

Each sub-LLM has access to web search tools (search, open) and can:\n   - Search for relevant information\n   - Open promising results to read full content\n   - Extract and summarize key facts\n\n3. **Synthesize findings**: After collecting sub-LLM responses, combine and cross-reference their findings. Look for:\n   - Consistent facts across sources (high confidence)\n   - Contradictions that need resolution\n   - Gaps that require follow-up research\n\n4. **Iterate if needed**: If the initial research reveals new questions or missing information, dispatch another batch of targeted sub-tasks.

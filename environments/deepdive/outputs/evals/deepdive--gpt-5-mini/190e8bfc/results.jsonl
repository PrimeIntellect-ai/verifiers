Marshal Pietro Badoglio led the column and Fidenzio Dall\u2019Ora organized the motorized force. Haile Selassie left Addis Ababa (early May) and Badoglio entered the city on 5 May 1936; Italy proclaimed annexation on 7 May and Victor Emmanuel III was proclaimed Emperor on 9 May 1936.\\n- What the advance\/parade was: a large motorized (often called \u201cmechanized\u201d for propaganda) column from Dessie to Addis Ababa intended as a show of force and a fast logistical advance. It comprised roughly 12,500 men, about 1,785 cars and trucks of many makes, artillery batteries, aircraft support and a squadron of light L3 tankettes (tankettes\/tanks in small numbers). Contemporary reports mention motorcyclists and tankettes in the entry.\\n- Was it a notable tank advance? Partly \u2014 there was a visible display of motor vehicles and a small number of L3 tankettes (and Italians later displayed captured Fiat 3000s in Addis Ababa), but it was not a mass armored breakthrough like later WWII panzer spearheads. The \u201cmechanized\u201d label mainly meant motorized transport and propaganda; the operation was as much a logistics and publicity success as a decisive armored action.']\n[Execution time: 176.79s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_NpsZVesLptV8XoD2FRwLzJH8\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Ask focused question via llm_batch about the election and which territories (including an island) gained representation\\\\nprompts = [\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Which election led to Giuseppe Bottai entering the national legislative body on 23 March 1939?

Reports vary but roughly 13\u201315 people were killed and some 40+ injured.\n- Who claimed it: The Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility (Amaq).\n- Immediate response on site: Iranian state media (reported by Tasnim\/IRNA and summarized in international outlets) said one attacker shot a shrine employee before his rifle jammed; bystanders and shrine staff chased\/pursued the attacker(s). Authorities later said two suspects were captured and one attacker was killed. Accounts differ on the number of assailants.\n- Named local rescuer: In the international sources reviewed (Al Jazeera, Wikipedia summary, CNN follow-ups) I found consistent reports that bystanders intervened and chased the shooter but did not find a widely corroborated, named individual who was universally hailed in major English-language reports.

Three clerics were stabbed; one, Mohammad Aslani (identified by semiofficial outlets), later died. Iranian media identified the suspected assailant as Abdolatif Moradi (reported as a 21\u2011year\u2011old ethnic Uzbek). Authorities said the attacker and several suspected accomplices were arrested. (See Reuters, RFE\/RL, Al Jazeera, France24, Wikipedia.)\n\n- Question of a named local resident intervening: I found no reliable international or Iranian news reports that identify or name a specific local resident who intervened and is credited by name.

This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's.

This entity established a subsidiary specializing in solar electricity, a field rapidly advancing in a major South Asian nation which notably utilizes building summits for energy capture. These summit-based energy installations are photovoltaic systems that often channel surplus electricity into the broader power grid. A critical electronic device in these grid-integrated setups is responsible for converting the panel's direct current output into alternating current. On a much larger scale, similar current conversion technology is employed in systems designed for bulk power transmission over extensive distances using direct current at very high potentials. Such long-distance systems, which operate with this non-alternating current to reduce energy loss, may, in certain configurations (especially those with a single main conductor), use a specific type of conductor to link to an earth grounding point.

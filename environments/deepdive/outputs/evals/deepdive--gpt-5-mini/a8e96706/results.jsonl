This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city. This political figure initially entered the national legislative body following a nationwide electoral contest, which distinctively integrated, for the first time, elected officials from several newly acquired territories.

He graduated at *Liceo Torquato Tasso* and attended the Sapienza University of Rome until the 1915, when Italy declared war to the Central Powers. The same year, he left his studies to enlist himself in the Italian Royal Army. Wounded in battle, he obtained a Medal of Military Valor after World War I.[1]\n\nIn 1919, Bottai met Benito Mussolini during a Futurist meeting,[2] and contributed to establish the *Fasci Italiani di Combattimento* (Italian Fasces of Combat). In 1921, Bottai ended his studies at law faculty and became a freemason, member of the *Gran Loggia d'Italia*.[3] At the same time, he also started a journalist career in the *Il Popolo d'Italia*, the newspaper of the recently founded National Fascist Party. During the March on Rome, Bottai was along with Ulisse Igliori and Gino Calza-Bini the head of the Roman *squadrismo*, supporting the Blackshirts' political violence.\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]After the 1921 Italian general election, Bottai was elected in the Chamber of Deputies for the National Blocs. In 1923, he became leader of the intransigent national syndicalist and revolutionary faction of fascism. To support his ideas, Bottai founded *Critica fascista* (*Fascist Critic*), a cultural periodical, co-operating with other left-leaning fascists like Filippo De Pisis, Renato Guttuso, and Mario Mafai.[4] Starting in 1930, he contributed to the political and finance magazine *Lo Stato*.[5]\n\nBottai worked to the Ministry of Corporations, introducing the Labour Charter and planning a Corporative Academic Pole in Pisa, from 1926 to 1932, when he was excluded by Mussolini from the Ministry.[6] In 1933, Bottai established and chaired the National Institute of the Social Security (Italian: *Istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale*, INPS). He was appointed governor of Rome (1935\u20131936) but resigned to fight in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War with the rank of major. On 5 May 1936, Bottai and Pietro Badoglio entered in Addis Abeba, and Bottai was appointed as vice governor. After the war, Bottai returned in Rome to be Education Minister. During his ministry, Bottai proclaimed a law (the Bottai Law) on safeguarding public and cultural heritage and the preservation of natural beauties.[7] He also co-worked with art critics Giulio Carlo Argan and Cesare Brandi to improve the Italian cultural life.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Bottai became more radical and a Germanophile. In 1938, he expressed support to racial laws against Italian Jews, and in 1940 founded *Primato* (*Primacy*), a magazine that supported the Aryan race's supremacy and interventionism in the war.[8][9] Bottai thought that the \"Fascist Revolution\" was incomplete and that what was needed was a return to the original and more \"pure\" fascism.\n\n## World War II\n\n[edit]The Italian intervention in World War II resulted in disaster. The Campaign on the Eastern Front caused the death or the injury of approximately 77,000 soldiers, with more than 39,000 injured. Bottai voted for Mussolini's arrest, which had been proposed by Dino Grandi, on 25 July 1943 after Italy's defeat had become evident. In 1944, the Italian Social Republic condemned Bottai to death, during the Verona trial, but Bottai hid in a Roman convent.[10] In 1944, Bottai enlisted in the French Foreign Legion with the pseudonym **Andrea Battaglia**. He fought in Provence during Operation Dragoon and then in the Western Allied invasion of Germany.\n\n## Later life\n\n[edit]After the war, Bottai remained in France and continued to serve in the Foreign Legion until 1948, when he was discharged. For his role in the final stages of World War II, he got an amnesty for his role in fascism. Returning in Italy in 1953, Bottai founded the periodical *ABC* (not to be confused with the magazine with the same name) and *Il Popolo di Roma*, which was financed by ex-fascist Vittorio Cini, who supported centrist and conservative views. Bottai died in Rome in 1959. At his funeral was Aldo Moro who, like Moro's father, had been Bottai's friend and assistant during his career.[11]\n\n## Bibliography\n\n[edit]*Trade organisation in Italy under the act and regulations on collective relations in connection with employment**Economia fascista*(1930)*Grundprinzipien des korporativen Aufbaus in Italien*(1933)*Esperienza corporativa (1929\u20131935)*(1935)*Corporazioni*(1935)*Scritti giuridici in onore di Santi Romano ...*(1940)*Funzione di Roma nella vita culturale e scientifica della nazione*(1940)*Pagine di critica fascista (1915\u20131926)*(1941, edited by F.

It was characterized by mass strikes, worker manifestations as well as self-management experiments through land and factories occupations.[4] In Turin and Milan, workers councils were formed and many factory occupations took place under the leadership of anarcho-syndicalists. The agitations also extended to the agricultural areas of the Po Valley and were accompanied by peasant strikes, rural unrests and guerrilla conflicts between left-wing and right-wing militias.\n\nIn the general election of 1921, the Liberal governing coalition, strengthened by the joining of Fascist candidates in the National Bloc (33 of whom were elected deputies), came short of a majority. The Italian Socialist Party, weakened by the split of the Communist Party of Italy, lost many votes and seats, while the Italian People's Party was steady around 20%. The Socialists were stronger in Lombardy (41.9%), than in their historical strongholds of Piedmont (28.6%), Emilia-Romagna (33.4%) and Tuscany (31.0%), due to the presence of the Communists (11.9, 5.2 and 10.5%), while the Populars were confirmed the largest party of Veneto (36.5%) and the Liberal parties in most Southern regions.[5]\n\n## Parties and leaders\n\n[edit]| Party | Ideology | Leader | Status before election | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Italian Socialist Party (PSI) | Socialism | Giovanni Bacci | Opposition | |\n| Italian People's Party (PPI) | Christian democracy | Luigi Sturzo | Government | |\n| National Bloc (BN) | Conservatism | Giovanni Giolitti | Government | |\n| Italian Democratic Liberal Party (PLDI) | Liberalism | Antonio Salandra | Government | |\n| Liberal Party (PL) | Liberalism | Luigi Facta | Government | |\n| Social Democracy (DS) | Social liberalism | Giovanni Antonio Colonna | Government | |\n| Communist Party of Italy (PCdI) | Communism | Amadeo Bordiga | Opposition | |\n| Italian Republican Party (PRI) | Republicanism | Eugenio Chiesa | Opposition | |\n| Reformist Democratic Party (PDR) | Social liberalism | Several | Opposition | |\n| Combatants' Party (PdC) | Veteran interests | Several | Government |\n\n## Results\n\n[edit]| Party | Votes | % | Seats | +\/\u2013 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Italian Socialist Party | 1,631,435 | 24.69 | 123 | \u221233 | |\n| Italian People's Party | 1,347,305 | 20.39 | 108 | +8 | |\nNational Bloc[a] | 1,260,007 | 19.07 | 105 | New | |\n| Italian Democratic Liberal Party | 684,855 | 10.36 | 68 | \u221228 | |\n| Liberal Party | 470,605 | 7.12 | 43 | +2 | |\n| Social Democracy | 309,191 | 4.68 | 29 | \u221231 | |\n| Communist Party of Italy | 304,719 | 4.61 | 15 | New | |\n| Italian Republican Party | 124,924 | 1.89 | 6 | \u22123 | |\n| Reformist Democratic Party | 122,087 | 1.85 | 11 | New | |\n| Combatants' Party | 113,839 | 1.72 | 10 | \u221210 | |\n| Lists of Slavs and Germans | 88,648 | 1.34 | 9 | New | |\n| Economic Party | 53,382 | 0.81 | 5 | \u22122 | |\n| Independent Socialists | 37,892 | 0.57 | 1 | \u00b10 | |\n| Dissident Populars | 29,703 | 0.45 | 0 | New | |\n| Fasci Italiani di Combattimento | 29,549 | 0.45 | 2 | New | |\n| Total | 6,608,141 | 100.00 | 535 | +27 | |\n| Valid votes | 6,608,141 | 98.61 | |||\n| Invalid\/blank votes | 93,355 | 1.39 | |||\n| Total votes | 6,701,496 | 100.00 | |||\n| Registered voters\/turnout | 11,477,210 | 58.39 | |||\nSource: National Institute of Statistics[6] |\n\n## Results by Region\n\n[edit]| Region | First party | Second party | Third party | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Abruzzo-Molise | BN | PLDI | PSI | |||\n| Apulia | BN | PSI | PPI | |||\n| Basilicata | BN | PLDI | PPI | |||\n| Calabria | BN | PLDI | SD | |||\n| Campania | PLDI | BN | PSI | |||\n| Emilia-Romagna | PSI | BN | PPI | |||\n| Lazio | PPI | BN | PSI | |||\n| Liguria | PSI | BN | PPI | |||\n| Lombardy | PSI | BN | PPI | |||\n| Marche | PPI | PSI | BN | |||\n| Piedmont | PSI | BN | PLDI | |||\n| Sardinia | BN | PPI | PSI | |||\n| Sicily | BN | SD | PLDI | |||\n| Trentino | PPI | BN | SeT | |||\n| Tuscany | PSI | PPI | BN | |||\n| Umbria | PSI | PPI | BN | |||\n| Veneto | PPI | PSI | BN | |||\n| Venezia Giulia | BN | PPI | SeT |\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**Dieter Nohlen & Philip St\u00f6ver (2010)*Elections in Europe: A data handbook*, p1047 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7**^**ITALY\u2019S FRINGE OF ALIEN SUBJECTS,*The New York Times*, May 29, 1921**^**Ministry of National Economy- ^\n**a**Brunella Dalla Casa,**b***Composizione di classe, rivendicazioni e professionalit\u00e0 nelle lotte del \"biennio rosso\" a Bologna*, in: AA.

This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city.

Since wildfire thrives in hot and dry climates, drought elevates fire risk significantly. Drought leaves trees, grasses, shrubs, and soil with very little moisture, making the landscape extremely flammable.\nQ: Is fire good or bad for forest ecosystems?\nA: The Good: The Beneficial Role of Fire in Landscapes While wildfires can have destructive effects, they play a beneficial role in nature. For example, some key functions that play include: Nutrient Cycling. Fires consume dead and decaying matter, returning nutrients to the soil, which promotes new plant growth.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_8uul8NK4CN1AwVRmHGrD8D78\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"ten sites\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"biomass\\\\\\\" interviews 'federal forests' 'accepted truths' 'common narratives' wildfire renewable energy paper 'forest' 'accepted truths' interviews ten sites 'forest service' 'biomass' 2010s\\\", \\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] Medicine Bow National Forest Routt National Forest\nURL: https:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/media\/67269\nIn 2007, the BBITF received a grant from the City of Steamboat Springs for $7,000 to be used to explore uses for woody biomass in the wake of beetle epidemics.\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Hawaii Statewide Assessment Of Forest Conditions and Trends: 2010\nURL: https:\/\/www.thewflc.org\/islandforestry\/hawaii.pdf\n... biomass of fire adapted non-native grass species is an easily ... ten sites were selected based on a comprehensive review of travel.\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Hawaii Statewide Assessment of Forest Conditions and Trends: 2010.\nURL: https:\/\/dlnr.hawaii.gov\/forestry\/files\/2013\/09\/SWARS-Entire-Assessment-and-Strategy.pdf\n... biomass of fire-adapted non-native grass species is an easily ... ten sites were selected based on a comprehensive review of travel guides and ...\n\n---\n\nResult 3: [PDF] Gaining Depth - Forest Trends\nURL: https:\/\/www.forest-trends.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/SOWI2014_Full.pdf\nbiomass for energy.

The rule of thumb is 10%, but this is very approximate. Typically the numbers and biomass of organisms decrease as one ascends the food chain.\nQ: Is biomass fuel better for the environment?\nA: While burning biomass releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, the CO2 emitted is the same amount that was absorbed by the plants during their growth. This creates a closed carbon cycle, making biomass energy a sustainable and environmentally friendly option.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_SnnTXNrNMIcmVyNwZ0lwPvnS\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/251628766_Guidelines_for_harvesting_forest_biomass_for_energy_A_synthesis_of_environmental_considerations\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/251628766_Guidelines_for_harvesting_forest_biomass_for_energy_A_synthesis_of_environmental_considerations\nError fetching https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/251628766_Guidelines_for_harvesting_forest_biomass_for_energy_A_synthesis_of_environmental_considerations: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/251628766_Guidelines_for_harvesting_forest_biomass_for_energy_A_synthesis_of_environmental_considerations'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_CSKYNvy7nhx7TmU6CnDi1IUF\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Guidelines for harvesting forest biomass for energy: A synthesis of environmental considerations\\\\\\\" citation author '2011' 'USDA' 'biomass guidelines'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Guidelines for harvesting forest biomass for energy\nURL: https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0961953411003539\nby D Abbas \u00b7 2011 \u00b7 Cited by 140 \u2014 November 2011, Pages 4538-4546.

It synthesized perspectives gathered through in-depth interviews with diverse local stakeholders (industry, agency, community, tribal) across ten representative US sites. One contributor to this work, holding advanced degrees from both the UK and a major Midwestern land-grant university system, had also previously explored the synthesis of environmental guidelines for biomass harvesting and assessed the lifecycle impacts of roundwood logistics in the Great Lakes region.

It was built to supplement the Pinetree Line, which was located farther south. The majority of Mid-Canada Line stations were used only briefly from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, as the attack threat changed from bombers to ICBMs. As the MCL was closed down, the early warning role passed almost entirely to the newer and more capable DEW Line farther north.\n\nThe MCL was based on the bistatic radar principle, using separated transmitters and receivers. An aircraft flying anywhere between the stations would reflect some of the transmitted signal towards the receiver, where it would mix with the signal travelling directly from the transmitter. The mixing of the two signals produces a pattern that is very easy to detect using simple electronics. As the transmitter is not pulsed, it does not require high voltages and is very simple as well. This leads to a very low-cost system that can cover huge areas, at the cost of providing no information about the precise location of the target, only its presence.\n\nThroughout its history, the MCL suffered from a problem that was never solved; because of the way bistatic radar works, any object relatively close to either station produces a large signal, in contrast to conventional monostatic (single site) radars where this effect is limited to the area immediately around the site. In the case of the MCL, this caused problems when flocks of birds would fly anywhere near either station and swamp the signal of a more distant aircraft. Solving this problem using the Doppler effect was a major design criterion for the AN\/FPS-23 \"Fluttar\" that filled a similar role in the DEW line.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Impetus\n\n[edit]Construction of the Pinetree Line had only just started when air planners started to have concerns about its capabilities and siting. By the time it detected a potential attack by jet-powered aircraft, there would be little time to do anything before the attack reached Canadian or northern U.S. cities.[1] Additionally, the Pinetree systems used pulsed radars that were fairly easy to jam and were unable to detect targets close to the ground due to \"clutter.\" Although expensive in terms of fuel use, it would be possible for Soviet bombers to evade detection by flying lower and plotting a course between the stations.\n\nBennett Lewis, head of the AECL Chalk River Laboratories and former Chief Superintendent of the UK Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) had proposed to the Defence Research Board (DRB) a system that avoided both of these problems.[2] Known today as a forward scatter bistatic radar, it used two antennas, a transmitter and receiver, separated by some distance. The antennas were positioned and aimed so that the signal from the transmitter filled the space above the line between the two stations. An aircraft flying into this region would reflect some signal back towards the receiver, allowing detection at altitudes as great as 65,000 ft.[1]\n\nA major advantage of the system is that it requires much less power to operate effectively. In a conventional radar, the radio signal has to travel to the target and back again. As each leg of the journey is subject to the inverse square law, the resulting radar equation contains a fourth-power dependence. In contrast, a forward-scatter radar signal always travels about the same total distance, from the transmitter to the receiver, modified only by the altitude of the target. This means it is dependent on the square root of range and not the fourth root, and thus delivers considerably more energy onto the receiver than a conventional radar over the same range. Also, unlike a conventional \"monostatic\" radar, the transmitter did not have to turn off to allow the receiver to listen for the signal. Since the total amount of energy received at the receiver is a function of both the peak power and the length of the pulse, using a continual signal means the same total energy will be deposited using much lower peak transmitter power. As a result, Lewis' system would require smaller sites and much less power than conventional radars like those of the Pinetree Line.[3]\n\nThe major disadvantage of the system is that it did not indicate the aircraft's location within the beam, unlike a pulsed system where pulse timing can be used to determine range. This means the forward-scatter concept is useful for making a \"radar fence\" or \"trip wire\"[1] that indicates that something is approaching, but not exactly where it is. To help address locating the target to a degree, the proposal was to build two interlinked fences, so that each pair of stations was perhaps 30 kilometres (19 mi) apart, a short enough distance that the radar on an interceptor aircraft would be able to find the target within that area. Using two overlapping sets also allowed one pair to cover the dead zone directly above the towers of the other.\n\nLewis' initial concept was to place the transmitters and receivers on telephone poles and electric power transmission towers, which provided both a convenient location as well as the small amount of power needed to run the electronics. In the case of the telephone poles, the lines would also be used to send the data back to the tracking stations. This concept generated a considerable amount of interest, although it was abandoned for reasons that are not entirely clear. Willis and Griffiths speculate it might be the need for 1,000 such radars,[4] but it is also likely that the desired to locate the line further north than the heavily settled areas in southern Canada was likely significant as well. In any event, the simplicity of the concept helped bring it to the attention of air planners.[4]\n\n### Spider Web\n\n[edit]The DRB decided to pursue Lewis\u2019 idea in 1950\u201351 by directing a research contract to the Eaton Electronics Research Laboratories of McGill University, headed by Professor Garfield Woonton. Lewis suggested to DRB and Woonton that he put the project in the hands of associate professor, J. Rennie Whitehead as project leader, a former colleague of his from the TRE days in the UK who had recently taken a position at the Lab. Some preliminary tests were made in 1952 with breadboard hardware built by a graduate student, Hugh Hamilton, in order to confirm the validity of the idea.[2]\n\nIn the meantime RCA Victor had been brought in by the DRB to design and produce the receivers, transmitters and antennas for tests on a substantial scale. The testing was performed in the summer of 1953, when Whitehead and his team of RCA Victor and RCAF personnel installed and operated a string of seven stations stretching from Ottawa to Mattawa[a] along the Ottawa River valley. Known under the code name of *\"Spider Web\"* at the suggestion of Hamilton, the tests were made with aircraft from CFB St. Hubert, near Montreal. All observations were transmitted to and made in the line HQ, which was set up in the equipment hut of one of the seven stations, located in Deep River.[2]\n\nFlight Lieutenant Andrew Matthews of the 104 Communications Flight at RCAF St. Hubert arranged for a series of different aircraft to fly through the network, including an Auster light aircraft, a T-33 Shooting Star, an Avro Lancaster bomber and even a recently acquired de Havilland Comet jet transport. The tests revealed a great deal about the spectral \u2018signatures\u2019 of aircraft crossing the line at different points, and demonstrated the capability to detect all sizes of aircraft from 100 ft to over 40,000 ft in altitude. During this time Dr. Ross Warren of RCA Victor and Dr. Whitehead jointly developed the theoretical background for the work in a major report to DRB.[2]\n\nThe Spider Web trials were followed in 1954 by intensive tests on a single 30 miles (48 km) wide link, built in the Eastern Townships by Bell Canada, who had by this time been given the go-ahead for the implementation of the Mid-Canada Line. When Whitehead inquired why RCA had not been given the contract, a colleague replied \"Who do you think runs Canada?\"[2][b] The trials on this prototype link were also conducted by Whitehead and a small team in collaboration with Air Defence Command, St. Hubert, this time on behalf of Bell. The trials involved the flyover of numbers of B-52 bombers by arrangement with Strategic Air Command and a local bombplot unit. They also had full-time use of an Avro Lancaster from CFB Greenwood for the important low-level tests.[2]\n\n### Deployment studies\n\n[edit]In February 1953 the Canada-U.S. Military Study Group (MSG) was asked \"to study those aspects of the North American Air Defence System in general, and the early warning system in particular, which are of mutual concern to the two countries.\"[6] The MSG then asked the air defence commanders of Canada and the United States to prepare independent briefs on the subject. By July 1953, RCAF Air Defense Command had completed its brief, followed shortly thereafter by its USAF counterpart. Both reports suggested building a Doppler fence farther north, along the 55th parallel, roughly at the entrance of James Bay into Hudson Bay.[6]\n\nIn October 1953 the MSG recommended to both governments \"that there be established at the earliest practicable date, an early warning line located generally along the 55th parallel between Alaska and Newfoundland\",[6] and outlined their minimum operational requirements. By the end of November 1953, the Mid-Canada Line had been approved in principle. Unlike the jointly-operated Pinetree line and future DEW line, the Mid-Canada line would be funded and operated entirely by the RCAF. The DRB estimated that the system would cost about $69,700,000, while an independent RCAF report placed it at $85,000,000, equivalent to $243,200,000 in 2023.[6]\n\nIn December an effort started to try to understand what sort of problems would be encountered during construction. Several \"trains\" consisting of tractor-pulled sleighs set out cross-country. One, manned by the RCAF, set out eastward from Fort Nelson, BC in order to link up with a second moving west from Flin Flon, Manitoba, while a third crewed by the Army left Lake Nipigon near Thunder Bay, Ontario for Lansdowne House about 200 kilometres (120 mi) further north. The missions proved that it was possible to build the new line, but only during the winter when the muskeg was frozen solid.[6] These missions also inspired the U.S. Army to invest in purpose-built overland trains which they experimented with in the 1960s but never put into production.[7]\n\nWhile that was taking place, efforts were underway to start primary siting studies. It quickly became clear that the areas in question, at least in eastern Canada, were so remote that there was no really accurate topographical information. A huge effort to map the area in a 15-mile wide strip across the entire country was started by Transport Command almost immediately, and ended by the spring of 1954. With this information in hand a construction division was set up, the Systems Engineering Group (SEG), in February 1954, tasked with producing a final report on the system to be submitted on June 1.[6]\n\n### Finalizing the plans\n\n[edit]As the experiments continued it became clear that by using taller masts, 350 feet (110 m) tall, the radar stations could be located further apart, up to 90 kilometres (56 mi). This reduced the number of stations required. Nevertheless, the price rose, now estimated at about $120,000,000. Although their final report was not yet ready, the SEG put in an interim report in June and it was approved by cabinet by the end of the month.[6]\n\nIn their report they outlined the system that would be built almost exactly. It called for eight major *Sector Control Centres*, numbered from 200 to 900, each of which control up to thirty unmanned radar sites for a total of 90 radar stations.[6] Each of the radar stations consisted of a single tall mast with a number of small dishes in fixed positions on top (typically four, two pointed in either direction), with power and electronics located in a building beside the base of the mast.\n\nThe sector control centres were linked using an advanced microwave communications system developed in part by CARDE, which scattered off the troposphere for long-distance communications. The southernmost site along the eastern portion of the line, at Cape Henrietta Maria on Hudson Bay, was used as the main communications point, with three additional repeater stations transferring data from the line southward to the NORAD command center in North Bay, Ontario. The easternmost station at Hopedale, Labrador was co-located with an existing Pinetree Line station in order to save construction costs.[6]\n\nAll aircraft transiting the line would have to file a flight plan through the *Mid Identification Zone*, or *MIDIZ*, centred on the fence. The plans also called for the construction of several airbases known as *Line Clearance Aerodromes* just to the north of the line, where interceptor aircraft could operate in times of heightened alert.[6]\n\nAt about this time another huge civil engineering project was underway in Canada, the construction of a cross-Canada microwave relay telephone system. Since many of the logistics problems were similar, the construction group, led by Bell Canada, was selected as a major contractor for the base construction. Detailed site selection started in 1955, with a major surveying effort running across Canada at the 55th parallel. The sites were so remote that the RCAF had to form up its first all-helicopter squadron in order to provide flight support for the survey teams.[6]\n\n## Construction and service\n\n[edit]Construction started in 1956 and proceeded quickly. By April 1957 the eastern half was operational, and the line was declared fully operational on January 1, 1958. Operations were shortly integrated into the newly formed NORAD. Even the SEG's revised estimates turned out to be too low, and the fence's final cost is estimated at $224,566,830, equivalent to $2,321,000,000 in 2023.[6]\n\nAlmost as soon as the units went into operation, a serious problem was seen. Due to the large radar cross sections seen in forward-scattering radars, even small targets produced detectable signals. This was multiplied if the targets were roughly the same size as the wavelength of the radar, or in this case, tended to be spread out in patterns that were multiples of that wavelength. This problem was triggered by the large flocks of migrating waterfowl during the spring and fall, which created signals so powerful that it rendered the radars useless. Testing on the Spider Web and Eastern Townships systems had both been carried out during the summer, so this had not been noticed.[8]\n\nEven before the line became operational, in a repeat of earlier history, a new and more capable line was already under study that would combine the plotting capability of the Pinetree system with the line-breaking capabilities of the MCL, and located much farther north to dramatically improve the detection and response times. Emerging as the Distant Early Warning Line, or DEW, construction started before the MCL had become operational. When the DEW line became operational in 1957, the value of the MCL was eroded, and the RCAF started pressing for it to be dismantled.[6]\n\nAlthough technically capable, the MCL gave little information for vectoring interceptors to their targets, so these tasks still required the Pinetree radars much farther south. The extra time offered by the MCL was not considered worth the trouble of keeping the line operational. The USAF disagreed, but in spite of their objections, the western half of the line was shut down in January 1964, leaving the eastern half to help defend the industrial areas of Canada and the US. As the Soviet Union moved their offensive capability to ICBMs it became clear that both the MCL and Pinetree systems were of limited use, and the entire Mid-Canada line was shut down in April 1965. The operations site located at Cranberry Portage, Manitoba, for example, has been converted into a high school and residence since active operations at the site closed in the mid-1960s.[6]\n\nThe DEW line stations were sited to provide the best possible view of the horizon, but there remained a minimum detection angle below which aircraft could sneak by without being seen. During early planning, a system like the MCL's towers was considered as gap-fillers between the stations to prevent these sorts of intrusions. As the MCL came online and the problem with birds became clear, the original forward-scatter concept was replaced by one using Doppler filtering to ignore anything flying below 125 miles per hour (201 km\/h). These AN\/FPS-23 \"Fluttar\" systems did indeed filter out birds, but failed to filter out the general aviation aircraft flying in the area, including those flying base-to-base for servicing and crew rotations.[9] As a result, the false-alarm rate rendered it just as ineffective as the MCL, and it lasted even a shorter time, shut down in 1963.[10]\n\n## Stations\n\n[edit]From a December 1956 listing:[11]\n\n## POL Supply Points\n\n[edit]Petroleums, Oils and Lubricants (POL) Supply Points were distribution centers for consumable petroleum materials used to fuel and maintain the Mid-Canada Line DDS sites. Co-located with Sector Control Stations when possible, petroleum products were received in bulk and shipped out by air from these locations. From the same December 1956 listing.[11]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## Notes\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]### Citations\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b**McCamley 2013, p. 34.**c** - ^\n**a****b****c****d****e****f**Whitehead 1995.**g** **^**Willis & Griffiths 2007, p. 37.- ^\n**a**Willis & Griffiths 2007, p. 36.**b** **^**Lester, Alex (2019).*Special Contract: A Story of Defence Communications in Canada*(PDF).

Run by North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) (after its creation), over half were staffed by United States Air Force personnel with the balance operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force. The line was the first coordinated system for early detection of a Soviet bomber attack on North America. Its radar technology quickly became outdated, and the line was in full operation only for a short time.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]Plans for what would become the Pinetree Line were underway as early as 1946 within the Permanent Joint Board on Defense (PJBD), a Canadian-U.S. organization. However, the costs of running such a system in the post-war era was too high, and instead Canada concentrated on the areas around Ontario and Quebec, while the United States set up stations in the Midwest and along the eastern seaboard.\nWith the successful test of an atomic bomb in the USSR, plans changed considerably. In 1949 Congress agreed to a $161 million construction program in co-operation with the RCAF, for a continuous line of stations across southern Canada. The USAF's Continental Air Command and the RCAF met in October 1950 to start planning, and in January 1951 the PJBD presented *Recommendation 51\/1 for the Extension of the Continental Radar Defence System*. The USAF later requested an additional set of six (potentially) mobile stations to provide low-level coverage. Later, it was learned the original radar systems performed better than expected, hence a number of the mobile sites were never deployed.\n\nThe system was eventually deployed as a series of 33 main stations and 6 smaller \"gap fillers\". The majority of these ran in a line at about the 53rd parallel in the west (to offer coverage of major Canadian cities) and about the 50th parallel in the east. A second line ran up the eastern seaboard from the southern tip of Nova Scotia to the southern tip of Baffin Island. Of these, 22 of the main stations and all of the gap fillers were paid for by the USAF, leaving 11 to the RCAF. However 16 of the main stations were staffed by RCAF personnel. On 1 January 1955, the system was officially handed over to RCAF command, and over time an additional 10 stations were added. The stations on the east coast used the Pole Vault system for communication.\n\nThe Pinetree Line had several technical problems that limited its usefulness almost immediately. For one, the system used a simple pulse radar technique, which made it unable to detect targets close to the ground due to radar clutter as well as being trivially easy to jam using the recently introduced carcinotron tube. Another was that its location near population centres meant it offered only a last minute warning, and as the USSR moved to jet-powered bombers the warning time was reduced. Studies were already underway in 1951 to build a series of Doppler bistatic radar stations somewhat farther north, which would develop into the Mid-Canada Line. By 1957, just over a year after the Mid-Canada Line was operational, a more advanced long-range search radar, mainly in the Canadian north and Alaska were deployed comprising the Distant Early Warning Line.\n\nThe Pinetree stations were kept operational during this period, and most underwent modifications as a part of the deployment of the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE). SAGE dramatically reduced the workload at the stations, cutting staff requirements by well over half. By the later 1950s some were being mothballed as newer systems came on line to the north. Nevertheless, many of the Pinetree stations were kept operational into the 1980s, particularly on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\n\n## Radar stations\n\n[edit]Initial sort is based on longitude from east to west.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- List of Royal Canadian Air Force stations\n- United States general surveillance radar stations\n*Radar Station*, a 1953 short documentary about the Pinetree Line- Continental Air Defense Integration North\n- Continental Air Defense Command\n\n## References\n\n[edit]This article incorporates public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency\n\n*A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946\u20131980*, by Lloyd H.

A part of the United States Air Force's Air University, AWC emphasizes the employment of air, space, and cyberspace in joint operations.[1] Headquartered at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, its higher headquarters is the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.[2] It is one of six war colleges within the U.S. Department of Defense's Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) Phase II Education Program for commissioned officers.[3]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]**The Air War College** was founded in 1946 by the United States War Department (subsequently merged with the Navy Department to form the Department of Defense) as a U.S. Army Air Forces program at what was then Maxwell Field. The college has operated continuously since its founding except for a period of six months during the Korean War.[4]\n\nAWC operates alongside the Army War College, the Naval War College's College of Naval Warfare, the Marine Corps War College, and the National Defense University's National War College (NWC), Joint Forces Staff College (JFSC) and Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy (Eisenhower School) within the U.S. Department of Defense's JPME II Education Program for commissioned officers.\n\n## Professional military education\n\n[edit]In 2006, the Air War College (AWC) curriculum was certified as a JPME Phase II program by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for AWC classes in Academic Year 2007 and subsequent.[5]\n\nAccording to the Air War College webpage, \"The AWC resident program class membership includes senior officers in the ranks of Lieutenant Colonel (O-5) and Colonel (O-6), or, in the case of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, Commander (O-5) and Captain (O-6), from each U.S. military service (both Active Component and Reserve Component, the latter to include the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard). AWC students also include civilian employees of federal government agencies at the grades GS-14\/GM-14 or GS-15\/GM-15, and equivalent rank military officers from the international community of nations.\"[6]\n\nIn addition to its resident program at Maxwell AFB, the Air War College also conducts two non-resident distance learning programs for eligible U.S. military officers or equivalent Department of Defense or Department of the Air Force civilians (e.g., O-5, GS\/GM-14, O-6, or GS\/GM-15).\n\nThe first of these programs is a 10-month seminar course in a traditional classroom setting that tracks in parallel with the resident course at Maxwell AFB. Seminars are overseen by the Air War College staff and are conducted annually at the Pentagon and selected USAF installations.\n\nThe second program is a CD-ROM based correspondence course that can be taken at any time during the year and typically takes two years to complete.\n\nEligible senior member lieutenant colonels and above of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), the civilian U.S. Air Force Auxiliary, who possess a minimum of a bachelor's degree are also entitled to enroll in the Air War College. Although they are precluded from attending in residence, CAP senior member officers may complete the AWC curriculum in a traditional classroom setting with U.S. military officers and senior DoD and DAF civilians as part of a year-long on-base seminar program at an active USAF installation if they already have base access authorization (automatic for senior members who are military retirees or active status reservists or national guardsmen), or through distance learning, e.g., individually via the correspondence course option.[7]\n\nThe AWC resident program at Maxwell AFB consists of ten months of postgraduate level courses for a total of 36 semester credit hours. Graduates receive a Master of Strategic Studies. Non-resident AWC students attending the parallel track 10-month classroom seminar program at either the Pentagon and\/or at other USAF installations worldwide, are also eligible to receive graduate level academic credit, albeit at a lesser number of credit hours.\n\nCompletion of the Air War College via in-residence, seminar or correspondence\/CD-ROM formats, or in-residence completion of an equivalent senior level war college program of another service, or that of a senior level joint institution such as the National War College or the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy, is considered a *de facto* requirement for all lieutenant colonels (O-5) in the U.S. Air Force, to include the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, to promote to colonel (O-6) and to be competitive for future selection as a general officer.\n\n## Course description\n\n[edit]The Air War College is an advanced postgraduate program that functions as the senior professional military education (PME) school of the U.S. Air Force. It emphasizes the development of joint knowledges, skills and attributes required of all Air Force, Sister Service, and international senior officers as well as Department of Defense and other National Security civilians, with special focus on their application to large organization and institutional leadership responsibilities.\n\nThe resident course is ten months in duration. The college also offers a ten-month non-resident seminar program on select active USAF installations and at the Pentagon which mirrors the same ten-month academic schedule of the resident program. There is also a non-resident Air War College CD-ROM\/correspondence course that is typically completed in 24 months or less.[8]\n\nThe Air War College's Mission is to:\n\"prepare students to lead in a joint, interagency and multinational environment at the strategic level across the range of military operations; to develop cross-domain mastery of joint air, space, and cyberspace power and its strategic contributions to national security; and to advance innovative thought on National Security, Department of Defense and Air Forces issues.\"[6]\n\nThe AWC curriculum focuses on five learning areas of emphasis:[6]\n\n**Learning Area 1: Profession of Arms Emphasis.**Graduates are capable of leading in a joint environment at the strategic level across the range of military operations.**Learning Area 2: Warfare Studies Emphasis.**Graduates make sound judgments on the cross-domain use of joint air, space and cyberspace power to maintain national security.**Learning Area 3: Leadership Studies Emphasis.**Graduates are prepared to exercise transformational leadership at group\/wing command and above levels in service, joint, and coalition settings.**Learning Area 4: International Security Studies Emphasis.**Graduates are equipped to advance innovative thought on national security, Department of Defense and Air Force issues.**Learning Area 5: Communication Studies Emphasis.**Graduates can communicate complex information in a clear, concise and logical manner in both written and oral formats.\n\n## National Security Forum\n\n[edit]Each year the Air War College (AWC) also hosts the **National Security Forum** (NSF), the NSF program being sponsored by the Secretary of the Air Force. NSF began in 1954 as an expansion of the Civilian Outreach Seminars held from 1947 through 1949.\n\nThe purpose of the NSF is to expose influential citizens to senior U.S. and international military officers and civilian equivalents in order to engage each other's ideas and perspectives on Air Force, national and international security issues. It is also an opportunity for the AWC students, as future military leaders, to interact with a broad cross-section of civilian leaders from businesses, industry, academia, public education, media, law, the clergy, and state and local governments, said civilian leaders possessing limited to no prior military experience.\n\nBecause of that latter caveat, retired career military personnel, military personnel serving part-time in the Reserve Components (to include the Army National Guard and Air National Guard), Department of Defense and U.S. Coast Guard civilian personnel, civilian spouses of military personnel, senior members of the Civil Air Patrol, and U.S. congressional members are precluded from being NSF attendees.[9]\n\nThe NSF provides a frank and candid exchange of views on national security matters among NSF attendees, Air War College students, and senior military and civilian leaders. The week is devoted to exploring the many issues that affect the current and future security of our country. Specific objectives are:\n\n\n\u2022 To provide an extended opportunity for candid engagement of ideas on future and current Air Force, national and international security issues among the Air War College students, faculty, and invited guests of the Secretary of the Air Force (*e.g.*, the NSF attendees).\n\n\u2022 To provide a unique forum in which experts on various aspects of national and international security may discuss their views with students, faculty, and our NSF attendees. The NSF is also intended to broaden perspectives and garner a mutual understanding of the U.S. Air Force and national and international security issues between NSF attendees and senior U.S. and international officers and civilian equivalents.\n\nGuests are nominated from across the Air Force and by active and retired Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard general officers and previous NSF attendees. AWC forwards the nominations to the Secretary of the Air Force for his\/her approval and his\/her personal invitation. Approximately 150 selectees attend NSF each year. Specific details for NSF are provided with each nominee's invitation. Budgetary constraints preclude the Air Force from defraying guests' expenses. As a result, guests are responsible for their own transportation to Maxwell AFB, the cost of Distinguished Visitors Quarters (DVQ) lodging at Maxwell AFB, and the cost of meals.[9]\n\n## Accreditation\n\n[edit]The umbrella organization for AWC, the Air University, is accredited by the Commission of Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), and is authorized to grant the following degrees:\n\nMaster of Strategic Studies \u2013 offered by the Air War College\n\nMaster of Military Operational Art and Science \u2013 offered by the Air Command and Staff College (ACSC)\n\nMaster of Aerospace Studies \u2013 offered by the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS)\n\nMaster of Science in Flight Test Engineering \u2013 offered by the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAFTPS)\n\nAssociate in Applied Science \u2013 offered for USAF enlisted personnel by the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) with majors in 68 areas\n\n## Notable personnel\n\n[edit]- Paul D.

It is a subordinate command of the Air University (AU), also located at Maxwell AFB, and is part of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) headquartered at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas.[1]\n\nACSC prepares field grade or equivalent level commissioned officers of all U.S. military services in pay grade O-4 (e.g., majors in the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps and lieutenant commanders in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, as well as major-selectees and lieutenant commander-selectees), equivalent rank international military officers, and U.S. Department of Defense and Department of the Air Force civil servants of at least GS-12\/GM-12 level, to assume positions of higher responsibility within the military and other government organizations.[1]\n\nOfficers in pay grade O-4 and DoD\/DAFC civilians in grades GS-12\/GM-12 may also complete ACSC via distance learning options, either via a seminar program (if available) at an active USAF installation or via a correspondence course program in CD-ROM format.[2] Successful completion of ACSC or an equivalent command and staff college of another service (e.g., United States Army Command & General Staff College; College of Naval Command and Staff curriculum of the U.S. Naval War College) is considered a *de facto* requirement for all majors in the U.S. Air Force (to include Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard) to promote to lieutenant colonel.\n\nEligible senior members of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), the civilian U.S. Air Force Auxiliary, who hold the rank of major or above are entitled to attend ACSC. The curriculum is accessed by CAP student officers through the ACSC distance learning platform.[3][4]\n\nACSC is geared toward teaching the skills necessary for air and space operations in support of a joint campaign, as well as leadership and command at the USAF squadron level or its equivalent in the other services.[5] The school awards a Master of Military Operational Art and Science professional degree to students who complete the program's requirements.\n\n## Mission\n\n[edit]Prepare warriors to lead air, space and cyberspace forces in joint\/combined operations[5]\n\n## Organization\n\n[edit]ACSC has three deans:\n\n- education and curriculum\n- services and support\n- distance learning\n\nThey provide academic leadership to the school's faculty and student body. The dean of education and curriculum, assisted by the vice dean for academic affairs and vice dean for operations, coordinates the integration of the final curriculum content and directs the planning and implementation of the academic programs. The dean of distance learning is responsible for planning, organizing, and delivering the non-resident program of instruction through the departments of Curriculum and Operations. The dean of services and support leads the efforts of cross-cutting organizations including personnel, fitness, technology, facilities, and security. The commanders and staff of the 21st Student Squadron and the 38th Student Squadron are responsible for the health, morale, and welfare of 500 resident students and their families.[5]\n\n## Curriculum\n\n[edit]The present 10-month curriculum focuses on expanding understanding of air and space power and on the growth of mid-career officers. It is meant to:\n\n- facilitate the air and space minded thinking of students\n- develop and enhance abilities for higher-level command and staff responsibilities,\n- enhance students' abilities to think critically about operational air and space concepts in a dynamic international environment,\n- broaden students' understanding of the nature of conflict and current and future threats to the United States and its allies, and\n- develop and enhance students' abilities to plan and execute the joint campaign planning process and air and space operations to support the joint force commander.\n\nThere are currently five curriculum departments at the ACSC:\n\n- International Security and Military Studies\n- Joint Warfare Studies\n- Leadership, Command and Communication Studies\n- Airpower Studies\n- Specialized Studies\n[5]\n\n### Master of Military Operational Art and Science\n\n[edit]The Air Command and Staff College awards a Master of Military Operational Art and Science (M.M.O.A.S) professional degree in connection with the Air University to students who complete the program's requirements.[6][7][8] The college offers the MMOAS degree via its traditional 10-month in-residence program[9] or a self-paced online program[8]\nThe School of Advanced Military Studies of the United States Army Command and General Staff College awards a similar professional degree, the Masters of Military Art and Science. Upon completing the ACSC program, MMOAS graduates are awarded \"Intermediate Developmental Education\" (IDE) and Joint Professional Military Education phase 1 (JPME1) credit in the United States Air Force.\n\nThe MMOAS degree requires study in many academic disciplines related to war, peace, and the employment of military forces. They include established academic fields of study such as sociology, history, engineering, psychology, politics, geography, science, ethics, economics, anthropology, and others. It may also include other professional fields of practice such as medicine and the law insofar as they interact with the military or are applied to military matters. It provides intellectual and theoretical depth to the military profession and its practitioners. Thus, a large proportion of research in the field of military art and science is done to address practical problems faced by practitioners. Purely academic research, however, is also an integral part of the field and is essential to ensure its continued intellectual vitality. The results of scholarship and research in the field may be of interest and may be helpful to political leaders and policymakers, military officers, as well as to scholars and the interested public.\n\nMilitary art generally deals with the human dimensions of war and military operations. Military art is generally subject to qualitative rather than quantitative investigation, although it does not exclude the use of quantitative methods when appropriate. It includes such areas as psychology, leadership, individual and collective behavior, culture, ethics, and problem-solving. History provides the context and depth for the study of military art. Military art also includes such specifically military subjects as strategy, operational art, and tactics. Military science generally deals with the technical dimensions of war and military operations. Military science is generally subject to quantitative rather than qualitative investigation, although qualitative methodologies are used when appropriate. It includes such areas as the technological military applications and equipment made possible by the physical sciences, various engineering disciplines, industrial management, logistics, electronic simulations, communications technologies, and transportation technologies. Mathematics is an important tool in the practice of military science and associated disciplines. Specific military applications include gunnery and ballistics, materials science technology for soldier protection, transportation technologies, and communications technologies. The interdisciplinary field of military art and science may be pictured as a \"big umbrella\" which encompasses other academic disciplines and fields of professional practice.\n\n## Facilities\n\n[edit]ACSC is located in Spaatz Hall on Chennault Circle at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. The building contains a 600-seat auditorium for lectures by distinguished speakers, a smaller 135-seat auditorium for special presentations, plus a variety of conference rooms, staff and administrative offices, and lounge areas. Seminar sessions are held in specially designed rooms featuring closed-circuit television, an array of multimedia equipment, and student access to a school-wide computer network and the Internet. Students are issued more than 80 books to expand their professional capabilities and a personal laptop computer to use to keep track of the academic schedules, on-line reading assignments, and for use in examinations throughout the academic year.[5]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The Air Command & Staff College traces its roots to the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) located at Langley Field, Virginia, from 1926 to 1931, and Maxwell Field from 1931 to 1946. After World War II, with the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force in 1947, and as the service grew and developed, the requirements and expectations of the renamed **Air Command and Staff School** evolved to fulfill the service's educational needs.\n\nIn 1952, Major Jeanne M. Holm became the first woman to attend the Air Command and Staff School. She was later the first female USAF officer to achieve the rank of brigadier general and later major general.[10]\n\nIn 1962, the school became known by its current name, **Air Command and Staff College**.\n\nDuring academic year 1994, the school undertook the most significant change to its educational program since its inception. The school transitioned from a lecture-based to a seminar-centered, active environment with an integrated curriculum geared to problem solving across the continuum from peace to war. In academic year 1999, the school began efforts to align its curriculum under the Air University commander's Strategic Guidance for the Continuum of Education. That program now functions as a portion of a comprehensive and integrated career-long professional military education program.[5]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a**\"GoE Foundation :: Air Command and Staff College\".**b***www.goefoundation.org*.

'Canadian royal aviation') is the air and space force of Canada.\n\n[5]Its role is to \"provide the Canadian Forces with relevant, responsive and effective airpower\".\n\n[6]The RCAF is one of three environmental commands within the unified Canadian Armed Forces. As of 2020, the Royal Canadian Air Force consists of 12,074 Regular Force and 1,969 Primary Reserve personnel, supported by 1,518 civilians, and operates 258 manned aircraft and nine unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\n[3]\n\n[7]Lieutenant-General Eric Kenny is the current Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force and Chief of the Air Force Staff.\n\n[8]\n\nThe Royal Canadian Air Force is responsible for all aircraft operations of the Canadian Forces, enforcing the security of Canada's airspace and providing aircraft to support the missions of the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Army. The RCAF is a partner with the United States Air Force in protecting continental airspace under the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The RCAF also provides all primary air resources to and is responsible for the National Search and Rescue Program.\n\nThe RCAF traces its history to the Canadian Air Force, which was formed in 1920. The Canadian Air Force was granted royal sanction in 1924 by King George V to form the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1968, the RCAF was amalgamated with the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Army, as part of the unification of the Canadian Forces. Air units were split between several different commands: Air Defence Command (ADC; interceptors), Air Transport Command (ATC; airlift, search and rescue), Mobile Command (tactical fighters, helicopters), Maritime Command (anti-submarine warfare, maritime patrol), as well as Training Command (TC).\n\nIn 1975, some commands (ADC, ATC, TC) were dissolved, and all air units were placed under a new environmental command called simply **Air Command** (**AIRCOM**; French: *Commandement a\u00e9rien*). Air Command reverted to its historic name of \"Royal Canadian Air Force\" in August 2011.[9]\n\nThe Royal Canadian Air Force has served in the Second World War, the Korean War, the Persian Gulf War, as well as several United Nations peacekeeping missions and NATO operations. As a NATO member, the force maintained a presence in Europe during the second half of the 20th century.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### 1920\u20131945: Pre-unification\n\n[edit]The Canadian Air Force (CAF) was established in 1920 as the successor to a short-lived two-squadron Canadian Air Force that was formed during the First World War in Europe. Wing Commander John Scott Williams was tasked in 1921 with organizing the CAF, handing command over later the same year to Air Marshal Lindsay Gordon.[10] The new Canadian Air Force was a branch of the Air Board and was chiefly a training militia that provided refresher training to veteran pilots.[11][12] Many CAF members also worked with the Air Board's Civil Operations Branch on operations that included forestry, surveying and anti-smuggling patrols.[13] In 1923, the CAF became responsible for all flying operations in Canada, including civil aviation. In 1924, the Canadian Air Force, was granted the royal title, becoming the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Most of its work was civil in nature, with forest patrols of the northwest a major part of its operations;[14] however, in the late 1920s other agencies took up most civil tasks, with the notable exception of aerial photography surveys, and the RCAF evolved into more of a military organization.[15] After budget cuts in the early 1930s, the air force began to rebuild.[16]: 47\n\n#### Second World War\n\n[edit]During the Second World War, the RCAF was a major contributor to the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and was involved in operations in the United Kingdom, Europe, the north Atlantic, North Africa, southern Asia, and with home defence. Eight thousand, eight hundred and sixty-four Americans came north to volunteer for the RCAF and over 850 died in action.[17] By the end of the war, the RCAF had become the fourth largest Allied air force.[18]\nDuring World War II the RCAF was headquartered at a six-storey office building at 20-23 Lincoln's Inn Fields (built 1937), London.[19] A commemorative plaque can be found on the outside of the building.[20]\n\n#### 1945\u20131968\n\n[edit]After the war, the RCAF reduced its strength. Because of the rising Soviet threat to the security of Europe, Canada joined NATO in 1949, and the RCAF established No. 1 Air Division RCAF consisting of four wings with three fighter squadrons each, based in France and West Germany. In 1950, the RCAF became involved with the transport of troops and supplies to the Korean War; however, it did not provide RCAF combat units. Members of the RCAF served in USAF units as exchange officers and several flew in combat. Both auxiliary and regular air defence squadrons were run by Air Defence Command. At the same time, the Pinetree Line, the Mid-Canada Line and the DEW Line radar stations, largely operated by the RCAF, were built across Canada because of the growing Soviet nuclear threat. In 1957, Canada and the United States created the joint North American Air Defense Command (NORAD). Coastal defence and peacekeeping also became priorities during the 1950s and 1960s.[16]: 245, 377\n\n### 1968\u2013present: Unification\n\n[edit]In 1968, the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Canadian Air Force and Canadian Army were amalgamated to form the unified Canadian Forces. This initiative was overseen by the Defence Minister, Paul Hellyer. The controversial merger maintained several existing organizations and created some new ones: In Europe, No. 1 Canadian Air Group, operated Canadair CF-104 Starfighter nuclear strike\/attack and reconnaissance under NATO's Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force; Air Defence Command: operated McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo interceptors, CIM-10 Bomarc missiles and the SAGE radar stations within NORAD; Air Transport Command: provided strategic airlift for the NATO and UN peacekeeping missions; and Training Command. Aviation assets of the Royal Canadian Navy were combined with the RCAF Canadair CP-107 Argus long-range patrol aircraft under Maritime Command. In 1975, the different commands, and the scattered aviation assets, were consolidated under Air Command (AIRCOM).\n\nIn the early 1990s, Canada provided a detachment of CF-18 Hornets for the air defence mission in Operation Desert Shield. The force performed combat air patrols over operations in Kuwait and Iraq, undertook a number of air-to-ground bombing missions, and, on one occasion, attacked an Iraqi patrol boat in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Air Command's CF-18 Hornets took part in the Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia, and in the 2000s, AIRCOM was heavily involved in the Afghanistan War, transporting troops and assets to Kandahar. Later in the decade-long war, AIRCOM set up a purpose-specific air wing, Joint Task Force Afghanistan Air Wing, equipped with several CH-146 Griffon and CH-147 Chinook helicopters, CC-130 Hercules, CU-161 Sperwer and leased CU-170 Heron UAVs in support of the Canadian Forces and ISAF mission. The wing stood down on 18 August 2011.\n\nFrom 18 March to 1 November 2011, the RCAF was engaged in Operation Mobile, Canada's contribution to Operation Unified Protector in Libya. Seven CF-18 Hornet fighter aircraft and several other aircraft served under Task Force Libeccio as part of the military intervention.[21]\n\nOn 16 August 2011, the Government of Canada announced that the name \"Air Command\" was being changed to the air force's original historic name: Royal Canadian Air Force (along with the change of name of Maritime Command to Royal Canadian Navy and Land Force Command to Canadian Army). The change was made to better reflect Canada's military heritage and align Canada with other key Commonwealth countries whose military units use the royal designation.[22]\nThe RCAF adopted a new badge in 2013, which is similar to the pre-unification RCAF badge (although placed in the modern frame used for command badges). The Latin motto of Air Command \u2013 *Sic itur ad astra* \u2013 which was the motto of the Canadian Air Force when first formed after the First World War (before it became the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1924) was retained. Though traditional insignia for the RCAF was restored in 2015, there has been no restoration of the traditional uniforms or rank structure of the historical service (apart from a rank of \"aviator\", which replaced that of \"private\" in 2015).[23]\n\nOn 17 April 2014, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Canada was dispatching six CF-18s and military personnel to assist NATO in operations in Eastern Europe.[24]\n\n## Equipment\n\n[edit]### Aircraft\n\n[edit]The Royal Canadian Air Force has about 406 aircraft in service[ citation needed], theoretically making it the third-largest air force in the Americas, after the United States Armed Forces, and the Brazilian Air Force. However, an internal National Defence military readiness report noted that only about 40 percent of aircraft could be considered \"serviceable\" as of early 2025.\n\n[25]A 2025 report by the Auditor General of Canada found that one of the RCAF's biggest obstacles was a shortage of both trained fighter pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians.\n\n[26]\n\n### Current inventory\n\n[edit]| Aircraft | Origin | Type | Variant | In service | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Combat aircraft | |||||\n| CF-18 Hornet (CF-188) | United States | Multirole | CF-18A\/B Hornet HEP II | 85 | 98 CF-18A and 40 CF-18B have been delivered for a total of 138. 72 CF-18As and 31 CF-18Bs in inventory, 85 in operational use.[27][28]\n|\n| FA-18A\/B Hornet | United States | Multirole | FA-18A\/B Hornet HUG 3.2 | 10 | 12 F\/A-18A and 6 F\/A-18B have been delivered from Australia |\n| Maritime patrol | |||||\n| CP-140 Aurora | United States | ASW\/Patrol | Lockheed CP-140M | 14[29]\n|\nWill be replaced by up to 16 Boeing P-8A |\n| Reconnaissance | |||||\n| CE-145C Vigilance | United States | surveillance\/reconnaissance | Beechcraft King Air 350ER | 3[30]\n|\n|\n| Transport aircraft | |||||\n| CC-130 Hercules | United States | Tanker\/SAR | Lockheed CC-130E\/HR(T) | 12[29]\n|\n4 tankers and 8 SAR.[31]\n|\n| CC-130J Super Hercules | United States | Tactical airlifter\/SAR | Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 | 17[29]\n|\n|\n| CC-138 Twin Otter | Canada | Search and Rescue (SAR) | DHC-6 Series 300 | 4[29]\n|\n|\n| CC-144 Challenger | Canada | Transport | Bombardier Challenger 604, Bombardier Challenger 650 | 4[29]\n|\n2 Challenger 604, 2 Challenger 650 |\n| CC-150 Polaris | Multinational | Transport\/Tanker | Airbus CC-150, Airbus CC-150T | 3[29]\n|\n2 tanker and 1 VIP |\n| CC-330 Husky | Multinational | Transport\/Tanker | A330-200 | 3 | 9 new and used aircraft to be converted to MRTT role.[32][33][34] First aircraft arrived in Canada on 31 August 2023.[35]\n|\n| CC-295 Kingfisher | Spain | Search and Rescue (SAR) | Airbus CC-295 | 5 | Sixteen aircraft ordered to replace CC-115 Buffalo and CC-130 Hercules in the SAR role.[36]\n|\n| CC-177 Globemaster III | United States | Strategic airlifter | Boeing C-17A ER | 5[29]\n|\n|\n| Helicopters | |||||\n| CH-139 JetRanger | United States | Trainer | Bell 206B-3 | 13[29]\n|\n13 Airbus Helicopters H135 ordered as replacement.[37]\n|\n| CH-146 Griffon | United States \/ Canada | Trainer\/Transport\/SAR | CH-146C Mk II Griffon | 81[29]\n|\n85 tactical helicopters and 15 SAR.

He was among the first openly gay people to be on the Forbes 400 list of America's richest people.[1]\n\nHe is the founder and co-chair of the Gill Foundation, a private Denver-based philanthropic organization supporting efforts to secure nationwide civil rights for LGBTQ Americans.[2] As of 2019, he was the single largest individual donor to the LGBTQ rights movement in U.S. history, having personally committed more than $500 million since the early 1990s.[3]\n\nGill is also the founder of the pioneering page layout software company Quark, Inc.[2] Gill sold his fifty percent stake in the company in 1999 for a reported $500 million. Following the sale of his stake in Quark, Inc., Gill set aside sixty percent of his assets \u2013 more than $300 million \u2013 to fight for LGBTQ rights.[4]\n\nHe is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Josh.ai.[5]\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]Tim Gill was born in Hobart, Indiana, and moved to Colorado with his family when he was in third grade.[3] He attended Wheat Ridge High School in Jefferson County, Colorado, eventually studying computer science and applied mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.[2]\n\n## Philanthropy and political action\n\n[edit]Gill is the founder of the Gill Foundation, Gill Action Fund, and OutGiving.[6]\n\nGill first became involved in LGBTQ activism as a freshman at the University of Colorado at Boulder.[4] He volunteered for the campus gay-liberation group and later supported local HIV\/AIDS awareness.[4] In 1992, he continued his involvement in LGBTQ political action in response to the passage of Colorado Amendment 2, which prevented non-discrimination ordinances in the state from protecting people based on sexual orientation[6][1] and which the United States Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional in its 1996 ruling in *Romer v. Evans*.[7]\n\nHe is widely credited as a visionary strategist and mega-donor who has made significant contributions to virtually every major LGBTQ rights victory in the United States, from the 2003 *Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health* decision making Massachusetts the first U.S. state to allow same-sex marriage, to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 *Obergefell v. Hodges* decision legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the country.[4][6][1][8]\n\nGill, along with Pat Stryker, Jared Polis and Rutt Bridges\u2014called by the press the \"Gang of Four\"\u2014together donated significant funds in support of Democratic organizations in Colorado, which many believe helped to flip control of the state legislature to Democratic control in 2004.[9][10][11]\n\nIn July 2017, Gill was the subject of a profile by journalist Andy Kroll for *Rolling Stone* magazine titled \"The Quiet Crusader: How Tim Gill turned a $500 million fortune into the nation's most powerful force for LGBTQ rights.\"[4]\n\n### Gill Foundation\n\n[edit]Tim Gill founded the Gill Foundation in 1994, and co-chairs it with his husband Scott Miller.[12][13][14] The national, Denver-based non-profit organization underwrites academic research, polling, litigation, data analytics, and field organizing related to the LGBTQ rights movement.[4]\n\nThe foundation's initial focus was to build LGBTQ public acceptance through support of mainstream projects in Colorado.[6] The foundation established the Gay & Lesbian Fund for Colorado in 1996, which provides financial support to a variety of non-profit organizations in the state.[4][15] In addition to LGBTQ equality, the foundation focuses on providing STEM education to every Colorado student,[16][17] curbing predatory lending and increasing financial literacy,[18][3] and supporting public media.[19][20]\n\n### Gill Action Fund\n\n[edit]In 2005, Tim Gill established the Gill Action Fund, which is separate from the charitable endeavors of the foundation.[21] The political fund has helped to elect hundreds of pro-equality lawmakers across the country at the local, state, and federal levels.[4] In 2006, its first election year, the fund helped defeat 50 of the 70 anti-LGBTQ candidates it targeted.[4]\n\nThe fund also contributed to the successful 2016 election campaign of North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who defeated the incumbent Republican Gov. Pat McCrory.[4] Gill prioritized unseating McCrory after he championed and passed the anti-LGBTQ HB2 \"bathroom bill,\" which forced transgender people to use public restrooms corresponding with their sex at birth rather than their gender identity.[4]\n\n### OutGiving\n\n[edit]In 1996, Gill founded OutGiving, a private, invitation-only philanthropic conference, to bring major pro-LGBTQ philanthropists together. OutGiving holds a conference every two years to discuss philanthropic strategies.[22]\n\n### Freedom for All Americans\n\n[edit]Since the U.S. Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015, Gill has shifted his focus to securing non-discrimination protections in the 28 states where it is still legal to discriminate against LGBTQ people in housing, employment and public accommodations.[6][23]\n\nGill is credited with developing a bipartisan strategy for securing non-discrimination protections in traditionally Republican states.[6] In 2015, Gill, Paul Singer and Daniel Loeb, helped fund Freedom for All Americans to advocate for non-discrimination protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in states and local communities across the country.[24][25] Freedom for All Americans has successfully enlisted the support of businesses and corporations to work with Republican-held state legislatures to reject or overturn anti-LGBTQ legislation.[26][27] The organization borrows the state-focused model of Freedom to Marry, the grassroots organizations that directed the fight for same-sex marriage equality from state to state leading up to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 *Obergefell v. Hodges* decision.[28][29]\n\n### University of Colorado endowment\n\n[edit]In 1998, Gill endowed the Tim Gill Professorship in Infectious Diseases at the University of Colorado's medical school to support HIV research and education.[30]\n\n### Others\n\n[edit]In 2016, Tim Gill directed funding from the foundation to support a comprehensive theme study by the National Park Service to identify historically significant places related to LGBTQ history for potential inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or designation as a National Monument.[31][32][33]\n\n## Business ventures\n\n[edit]### ALF Products\n\n[edit]### Quark, Inc.\n\n[edit]After jobs at Hewlett-Packard and a consulting services firm, Gill started the company Quark, Inc. in 1981 with a $2,000 loan from his parents.[6][12][34] Quark produced page layout software for the graphics market. With the introduction of Fred Ebrahimi as CEO in 1986, and the launch of the company's flagship page layout software, QuarkXPress, in 1987, Gill became a multi-millionaire.[35] Gill sold his fifty percent interest in Quark in 1999 for a reported $500 million, citing his growing involvement in philanthropic and activist endeavors.[12][4]\n\n### Connexion.org\n\n[edit]In 2003, Gill created Connexion.org, a social media platform for engaging the LGBTQ community in political activities.[36] Connexion closed in September 2011.[37]\n\n### JStar LLC\n\n[edit]In March 2015, Gill co-founded the smart home technology start-up JStar LLC.[23] He is the chairman and Chief Technology Officer of the company.[38] JStar's flagship product is Josh.ai, a voice-controlled home automation system using JStar's own artificial intelligence technology platform.[38][39] The company is headquartered in Denver with offices in Los Angeles.[40] In July 2017, JStar announced an additional $8 million in private investment to create original hardware to compete with Google Home, Amazon Echo, and other devices with intelligent assistants inside.[41][42] Josh.ai can be used through Amazon Alexa-enabled devices, Google Home, and iOS and Android apps.[41][42]\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]Gill married his husband, Scott Miller, in Massachusetts in 2009.[43] They live in Denver, Colorado with their dog.[15]\n\nIn 2022, Gill's husband Scott Miller became the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein.[44]\n\nGill is an avid snowboarder.[2]\n\n## Awards and honors\n\n[edit]In 1996, Gill received the University of Colorado Distinguished Service Award for his work supporting HIV\/AIDS research.[30]\n\nMacworld awarded him the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.[45]\n\nGill was awarded the NOGLSTP GLBT Engineer of the Year Award in 2007.[46]\n\nIn September 2007, People for the American Way awarded Gill its Spirit of Liberty Award.[47]\n\nGill received Liberty Hill Foundation's Upton Sinclair award in 2011.[48][49]\n\nColorado Governor Jared Polis awarded Gill the Colorado 2019 Vanguard Legacy Governor's citizenship Medal.[50]\n\nIn August 2020, he was honored with Family Equality's Murray\/Reese Family Award.[51]\n\nIn January 2025, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Biden.[52]\n\nIn May 2025, Tim Gill and his husband, Scott Miller, were honored by TIME Magazine as \"Titans\" on the TIME 100 Philanthropy 2025 list. In the accompanying article, Gill says, \u201cWe understand there will be setbacks but we think that over time we will make incremental progress toward a freer and more fair world.\u201d[53]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b**Green, Joshua (March 1, 2007). \"They Won't Know What Hit Them\".**c***The Atlantic*.

The success of this treatment is highly dependent on parameters such as\ntissue electrical properties, applied voltages and spatial relations in placement of electrodes that are used to\nestablish a cell-permeabilizing electric field in target tissue. Non-thermal irreversible electroporation techniques for\nablation of tissue depend similarly on these parameters. In the treatment planning stage, if oversimplified\napproximations for evaluation of electric field are used, such as U\/d (voltage-to-distance ratio), sufficient field\nstrength may not be reached within the entire target (tumor) area, potentially resulting in treatment failure.\n\nResults: In order to provide an aid in education of medical personnel performing electrochemotherapy and\nnon-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation, assist in visualizing the electric field in needle electrode\nelectroporation and the effects of changes in electrode placement, an application has been developed both as a\ndesktop- and a web-based solution. It enables users to position up to twelve electrodes in a plane of adjustable\ndimensions representing a two-dimensional slice of tissue. By means of manipulation of electrode placement, i.e.\nrepositioning, and the changes in electrical parameters, the users interact with the system and observe the\nresulting electrical field strength established by the inserted electrodes in real time. The field strength is calculated\nand visualized online and instantaneously reflects the desired changes, dramatically improving the user friendliness\nand educational value, especially compared to approaches utilizing general-purpose numerical modeling software,\nsuch as finite element modeling packages.\nConclusion: In this paper we outline the need and offer a solution in medical education in the field of\nelectroporation-based treatments, e.g. primarily electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible tissue ablation.\nWe present the background, the means of implementation and the fully functional application, which is the first of\nits kind. While the initial feedback from students that have evaluated this application as part of an e-learning course\nis positive, a formal study is planned to thoroughly evaluate the current version and identify possible future\nimprovements and modifications.\n\nKeywords: Education on electroporation, Electromagnetic field visualization, Applications in subject areas,\nInterdisciplinary projects, Interactive learning environments\n\n* Correspondence: damijan.miklavcic@fe.uni-lj.si\nFaculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Tr\u017ea\u0161ka 25, Ljubljana\nSI-1000, Slovenia\n\n\u00a9 2012 Mahnic-Kalamiza et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Electroporation\nmainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly\ncomposed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short\nand intense electric fields. The physical mechanism\nresponsible for increased permeability is thought to be\nthe formation of nano-scale defects termed pores (thus\nelectroporation)\nin the lipid structure [3,4]. This\nallows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact\nmechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is\ntoo high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not\ninstead\nresult in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversif the cells\nible electroporation. On the other hand,\nsurvive,\nincreased permeability of membrane is only\ntemporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible\nelectroporation. This observed transient\nincrease in\npermeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of\napplications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA)\nfusion of\nintroduction of drugs into cells,\ndelivery,\ncells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer,\ngene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of\ndrugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6,7] for an overview. In these\napplications viability of the porated cells is important\nand thus irreversible electroporation is consciously\navoided and generally considered to be an undesired\nside effect. However, there are also interesting medical\napplications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as\nnon-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering\nthe domains of industrial [9,10] and environmental [11]\napplications.\n\nElectrochemotherapy\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that\nsuccessfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs.\nFor successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate\namplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and\nshape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake\nand hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or\npoorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been\nidentified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13,14]. The transport of bleomycin across the\n\nnonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited\n[15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and\nDNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity\nof bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several\nthousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is\nthe electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent\nincrease in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to\nreach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17,18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be\neradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be\ni.e. all cells in the tumor have to be\npermeabilized,\nexposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means\nthat the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends\non both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high\nelectric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we\nmust consider before we can confidently assume we\nhave successfully electroporated the entire tumor area.\nFirst, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue\nelectrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity\ncompared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric\nfield strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields\nin the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue\nof electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their\nshape, size and position. In general, there are two types\nof electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate\nelectrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with\neither a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two\nplates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively,\nwhich ensures good electrical contact, but has other\ndrawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure\ngood electrical contact and optimal distance between\nelectrodes to fit the tumor [21,22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous\nand dependent on their diameter,\ndistance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013\nthe task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even\nmore arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19,24] and in vivo studies [25] on\nimportance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need\nfor careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted\nby a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in\nthe ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of\nElectrochemotherapy) project,\nin the scope of which\nstandard operating procedures for ECT were published\n\n\n\n---\n\nMahnic-Kalamiza et al.

However,\nin advanced cases such as intracranial\n[27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need\nfor patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29,30].\n\ntissue, non-thermal\n\nNon-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue\nablation and other techniques\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation.\nWhile the high number of applied pulses used to\nachieve classical\nirreversible electroporation may also\ncause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the\nirreversible\ncurrent-conducting\nelectroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since\nit results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and\nno protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical\napplications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is\ntechnically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of\nchemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison\nto other ablation methods such as RF ablation or\ncryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the\nconnective structure [8,32]. Since it has been observed\nthat NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves,\nthere is hope of using this technique in treatment of\ntumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as\nthis treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of\nECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure\nadequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other\nminimally invasive therapies for treatment of deepseated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g.\nhigh intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation\nand radiofrequency ablation. The latter is a minimally\ninvasive procedure where a needle electrode is inserted\npercutaneously into a tumor, much as in ECT or NTIRE.\nThe electrode acts as an antenna for electromagnetic\nwaves emitted by a generator; the tumor is heated up\nand thereby destroyed [34]. As with NTIRE or ECT, the\nneed for accurate needle placement exists and its importance has been evaluated. Success,\nimproved\ntreatment, has been proven to be correlated to the experience of the operator [34].\n\ni.e.\n\nThe need for education on electroporation\nAs outlined in the paragraphs above, both reversible and\nirreversible electroporation are promising approaches in\ntreating solid tumors, however their success is highly\ndependent on local field strength. Poorly defined or unknown properties such as tissue conductivities and\n\ninhomogeneities in addition to our choice of electrode\ntype, positions and pulse amplitudes, affect the electric\nfield distribution. With many factors to take into consideration, we may dismiss important uncontrolled variables or use a well-studied but irrelevant model that\ncannot be applied to a specific situation. An example of\nthis is the persistent use of a very simple approximation\nfor electric field strength that holds only under very particular conditions. This frequently used approximation\nequates the electric field strength E to the voltage U applied on the electrodes divided by the distance d between the electrodes, i.e. E \u2248 U\/d. Since the local electric\nfield strength has been identified as the key factor in\nachieving both reversible and irreversible electroporation\n(see [19] for details), i.e. local E has to reach a certain\nthreshold value Erev or Eirrev, it is the parameter we most\noften optimize our electrode configuration for. There is\na problem, however, since this simple relation is strictly\nvalid only in an isotropic homogeneous medium between two infinitely large parallel plate electrodes. When\nusing parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this\nsimple model best approximates the actual field strength\nfar from the electrode edges, provided the electrode\nwidth is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results\nare even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of\ncourse there are no parallel plates to speak of (see\nFigure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore,\nusing the simple parallel plate approximation for E in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result\nin significant reduction of response in treatment for\nwhich the complete response rate has been shown to be\nas high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way\ninto more and more clinics worldwide [36-39] and\nestablishing themselves as safe and effective treatments\nit is becoming more and more important\nof cancer,\nthat medical personnel performing and planning ECT\n(or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action,\nthe underlying physics and possible pitfalls. This\npaper presents an application for visualization and\nanalysis of\nthe electric field strength in multipleneedle-electrode electroporation aimed at users with\nbasic knowledge of the principles of electroporation,\nbut lack of education in physics and engineering who\ninteractive and didactic\nmay therefore need visual,\ninstruments to gain a deeper understanding of\nthe\nprinciples necessary for effective use of these promising treatments. Since educational applications of the\nsort are scarce and research is focused primarily on\nadvancing the field rather than educating, the need\nto explore options and applications in this area of engineering education seems pressing and applicative\n\n\n\n---\n\nMahnic-Kalamiza et al.

The application is part\nof a now firmly established annual course Electroporation Based Technologies and Treatments, EBTT\n(http:\/\/www.ebtt.org). The e-learning laboratory exercise into which the presented application has been\nincorporated, has been developed and described previously [40].\n\nlong parallel\n\ngenerated by\n\nImplementation\nTheoretical background\nThe theoretical background for the mathematical engine that is at the heart of our application has been\nderived from the electrostatic field theory, more specifically, extended from a solution for electrostatic potential\ncharged\ntwo\nconductors given in [41]. We have omitted the detailed\nmathematical derivations here as they are outside the\nscope of this paper; however, we have included a derivation of the equations below in the Appendix for those\nreaders that may be interested in further development\nor modifications to our model. Below, we specify only\nthe final formulation of the mathematical model and\nthe method of application of this analytical solution\ninto the field-calculating engine that represents the\ncore of Application for Visualization of Target Tissue\n\nin Electroporation (ApiVizTEP), since this is the only\nessential part of the application around which the user\ninterface is built. Similarly to the approach that we\nin this paper, other analytical models have\npresent\nbeen developed previously using complex analysis. For\na six-needle array, one may find a first-order analytical\napproximation for the electric field strength in [42].\nOther authors have expanded on this approach further,\nsee e.g. [43] and [44]; however, these solutions do not\ngive an accurate analytical expression for the electric\nfield strength since quite possibly such a solution cannot be obtained for three or more electrodes active\nconcurrently at a given time. Since currently electroporation devices mostly power only one pair of electrodes at a time [45], we have not pursued a solution\nwith more than two concurrently active electrodes, thus\navoiding the derivation of an approximate solution. Instead, we give an accurate solution for a two needle electrode system that\nis not based (mathematically) on\npreviously published work.\nThe accurate analytical\n\nsolution for electric field\nstrength of two long parallel cylindrical conductors (needle electrodes) on a plane perpendicular to the conductor longitudinal axis (2-D solution), is given by the\nfollowing equation\n\n\n\n---\n\nMahnic-Kalamiza et al.

It can inactivate various spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms, though it has a limited effect on enzymes, spores, and viruses. Crucially, it retains other constituents like vitamins, minerals, pigments, and flavors.\nQ: What are the risks of electroporation?\nA: In particular, harmful side effects of electroporation-based therapies (electrochemotherapy, gene therapies, tumor ablation) include convulsions, pain, heart fibrillation, and thermal damage.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step 1 \u2014 Search: I searched for a 2012 BMC (BioMed Central) Medical Education paper from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Slovenia about an interactive tool for visualizing electric fields in multi\u2011electrode electroporation.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Locate: The search returned a PDF and PubMed entry for the paper.

(November 2010) |\n\n| EA Sports MMA | |\n|---|---|\n| Developer | EA Tiburon |\n| Publisher | EA Sports |\n| Platforms | |\n| Release | |\n| Genre | Sports |\n| Modes | Single-player, multiplayer |\n\n* EA Sports MMA* is a 2010 sports video game which was developed by EA Tiburon and published by EA Sports. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360\n\n[3]on October 19, 2010, in North America and October 22, 2010, everywhere else. Online services have been shut down since April 13, 2012\n\n[4]for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n[5]\n\n## Game details\n\n[edit]On June 1, 2009, Electronic Arts announced that an all-new fighting title is in development under the EA Sports brand. *EA Sports MMA* was released in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Its website did not reveal any facts about the gameplay or its release date, just one link to sign up for the EA Sports newsletter and another that directs people to EA Sports' MMA forum.[6] However, the Facebook page for the game released steady numbers of videos and amounts of preview information leading up to the release. This game has many options to create the ultimate MMA experience. The game focuses on global MMA, not restricting its gameplay to one brand or region.\n\nIt was announced that the first trailer would be shown on CBS, during *Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Rogers* on November 7, 2009. The trailer featured Emelianenko and Rogers performing a variety of attacks and defenses against each other. The trailer ended with both of the men about to punch each other in the face. It was announced that EA MMA would feature Strikeforce as its flagship promotion.[7]\n\nThe US cover for the game shows Fedor Emelianenko and Randy Couture, while the Japanese cover has Hidehiko Yoshida instead of Couture.[8]\n\n## Gameplay\n\n[edit]Players can move and strike at enemies. They can turn attacks into body punches, kicks or feints. Takedown\/transition attempts and takedown\/transition defense can be performed. Depending on the timing, the successful defense can result in a sprawl, transitional block or a reversal. Submissions can be attempted, and the defending player can prevent the hold from being applied if he reacts quickly enough. Otherwise, the fighters engage in one of two submission mini-games. Once a submission has been initiated, it is not possible to cancel out of it.\n\nFor arm and leg submissions, the players must tap either the submit or defend button several times until the defending fighter either submits or escapes. The idea is to tap the button in short bursts while maintaining the stamina at optimum levels and never letting it drain completely. For chokes, a circular image appears in the center of the screen. A colored marker moves along the circumference from clockwise to counterclockwise in unpredictable patterns and fades in and out of view. The player (whether on offense or defense) must track and match the movement of the marker with the left analog stick. The circle shrinks (while the screen fades to black) as the fighter gets closer to getting choked out and expands when one gets closer to escaping.\n\nThe game is set in venues to include boxing rings, circular cages, and hexagonal cages, and it includes multiple rule sets including Strikeforce, Japanese, and Vale Tudo rules in addition to standard Unified Rules. The game includes the ability to fight southpaw- or orthodox, execute foot stomps, soccer kicks and knees to the face on the ground, and fight on the cage, with clinch work and countering. Mauro Ranallo and Frank Shamrock provide commentary, but are unable to announce most custom names.[9] Jimmy Lennon Jr. is the announcer in Strikeforce rules and Lenne Hardt is the announcer Japanese and Vale Tudo rules. The game also featured 'Live Broadcasts' that could be viewed from PC or consoles. The player is able to upload hype videos, which will help to increase popularity. EA Sports would choose the fighters based on their Hype videos and schedule fight cards just like in real life MMA. Real-life prizes were given out, to a certain level.[10]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n[edit]The soundtrack features around 30 hip-hop, rock and metal songs from various artists through the EA Trax feature.\n\n## UFC controversy\n\n[edit]UFC president Dana White declared himself \"at war\" with EA over the development of the *EA Sports MMA* video game. According to White, the UFC had hoped that EA Sports would pick up the publishing rights to the UFC's video game license, but EA Sports declined. White remarks, \"EA Sports told us, 'You're not a real sport. We wouldn't touch this thing. We want nothing to do with this.'\" The UFC instead partnered with THQ to develop *UFC 2009 Undisputed*. \"We put our asses on the line, THQ, and the UFC, to make a video-game deal in the worst economy in the world,\" White told reporters in July 2009. \"We go out there and do this thing, and it's successful, and now EA Sports wants to do a video game.[11]\n\nWhite warned the fighters who intend to be included in the upcoming *EA Sports MMA* game release, claiming that \"If you do business with EA, you won't be in the UFC\". Former UFC heavyweight champions Tim Sylvia[12] and Andrei Arlovski, as well as Frank Trigg[13] and Vladimir Matyushenko[14] confirmed their presence in the *EA Sports MMA* video game. Fan favorite Randy Couture was under contract with UFC before agreeing to be a part of *EA Sports MMA*, but was able to take part in the game due to never signing over his likeness to the UFC for use in video games. White has since changed his standpoint on this subject.[15]\n\n## Game launch and reception\n\n[edit]| Aggregator | Score |\n|---|---|\n| GameRankings | 80.5% Xbox 360, 78.2% PS3 |\n| Metacritic | 79% Xbox 360, 78% PS3 |\n\n| Publication | Score |\n|---|---|\nEdge | 6\/10 |\nEurogamer | 7\/10 |\nGame Informer | 8.5\/10 |\nGamePro | |\nGameSpot | 7.5\/10 |\nIGN | 8\/10 |\nOfficial Xbox Magazine (US) | 9\/10 |\nX-Play |\n\n*EA Sports MMA* launched on October 19, 2010, with a public launch party for fans and media. At the gatherings, UFC Hall of Fame fighter Randy Couture and former Pride champion Fedor Emelianenko, both of whom grace the cover of the game, finally got the opportunity to fight each other, albeit via their video gamer personas. Fedor went on to win via TKO in the game.[16]\n\nInitial reviews have been positive with Metacritic giving the Xbox 360 version a score of 79% after 55 reviews (78% after 42 reviews for the PS3 version)[17][18] and Game Rankings giving the Xbox360 version a score of 80.5% after 39 reviews (78.2% after 25 reviews for the PS3 Version).[19][20] While *EA Sports MMA* remains a critical success thus far, it hasn't had the same success financially. According to a Cowen & Company analyst, sales of *EA Sports MMA* have been poor, with analyst Doug Creutz saying it's \u201cmore or less dead on arrival at retail\".[21]\n\nDuring the 14th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated *EA Sports MMA* for \"Fighting Game of the Year\".[22]\n\n## iOS\n\n[edit]On October 21, 2010 *EA Sports MMA* was released as for the iOS platform.[23] It is a scaled-down version of the game, featuring 24 fighters from five different weight class, create-a-fighter mode and career mode.[24]\n\n## Sequel\n\n[edit]On June 4, 2012, Dana White, along with THQ, announced that the UFC game license had been transferred to EA Sports, who produced the next cross-platform UFC game. On June 17, 2014, *EA Sports UFC* was released as a spiritual successor to both *EA Sports MMA* and *UFC Undisputed 3*.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**James Orry (9 June 2009). \"EA to alternate between Fight Night and MMA\".*VideoGamer.Com*.

Around this time Nathan was also setting up the online shop for indie-outfit Inertia as I was sitting next to him busily setting up and running their touring division.\n\nI had no clue what I was doing but Nathan, still beginning Future Classic, had a much firmer view of success. So, in our windowless office in a Waterloo industrial estate in Sydney, we\u2019d talk about the things we wanted our new ventures to do \u2013 and music.\n\nOne of the things that immediately struck me about Nathan\u2019s vision was the terrific attention to detail. He wanted to get it all absolutely right, on every level. Future Classic started out dealing in super-cool underground house and slightly left-of-centre techno 12-inches with these amazing sleeves. It turned out they were all designed by Jay, whose graphic design studio had (I suspect) a great deal more liquidity then than the European-distributed 12-inch business.\n\nThe music was precise and gorgeous and its packaging looked the same, which appealed, for a couple of reasons. The first is that firm grip on the imagination that Factory Records holds for any self-respecting music geek of a certain age.\n\nFactory had the masterful designer Peter Saville on their board and played with the concept of the \u201cmass secret\u201d \u2013 coded design work that pulled down any shouting about the band name and album title to vanishing levels, but was instantly recognisable to anyone browsing through the racks looking for the latest New Order 12-inch. I could see this same confidence in the look and art direction of each Future Classic release and admired it greatly.\n\nOf course, this was married to my love of the slightly art-house end of electronic music \u2013 tunes that remain danceable. Growing up in Perth in the 1990s, the ripple of the UK\u2019s summer of love that reached us was, essentially, rave. It was my sole experience of the form.\n\nStudying in London in 1996 and discovering the Blue Note club \u2013 where everyone from Andrew Weatherall, Metalheadz, Ninja Tune, Mo\u2019 Wax et al had a night \u2013 had an electric effect, galvanising me and leading to everything else that\u2019s happened in my music life. Here was classy, considered, adventurous electronic music that was also an enormous amount of fun to party to. This attitude seemed to be writ large in what Future Classic were attempting, too \u2013 the better the music, the better the party.\n\nAs the label grew, it was careful to keep a foot in the cultural world as well as the commercial, presenting some amazing bar nights at the Sydney festival (Whitest Boy Alive remains seared into my brain) alongside a killer fifth anniversary party at the Civic, Sydney in 2009 featuring DJ Henrick Schwarz. I kept up with releases as they moved from Deepchild to Jamie Lloyd to Cadillac to Mitizi and still remember how stoked I was when they secured a Luomo remix back at the start.\n\nI\u2019m taking a long time to mention the names everyone now associates with Future Classic \u2013 the mighty Flume and Chet Faker \u2013 but those are stories everyone who\u2019s interested already (and rightly) knows. The reason I invited Nathan, Jay and Chad into the Vivid Live program this year was because I felt we should shout as loudly as possible that they\u2019ve now been going for 10 years.\n\nA decade! Entire ecosystems of microglitchwitchhouse have come and gone in the fickle biosphere of electronic music. That\u2019s EDM to anyone under 20, I suppose \u2013 resistance to the term betrays my fulsome age.

Its creators have tried to replicate the strength in depth of its main competitor, THQ\u2019s UFC Undisputed franchise, by having the likeness of 60 active & classic fighters in their EA MMA roster.\n\nWith such a high volume of both recognisable & unfamiliar faces found when selecting characters in-game, it is salient to point out these fighters, in order to inform both casual or hardcore MMA players of the full EA MMA fighter list. This article will serve as a complete EA MMA fighter list, detailing both the weight classes and names of every roster member, including some information on the real life MMA promotions licensed by EA also.\n\nLike the UFC Undisputed series, there will be five separate weight classes in the game, with each fighter having at least one default division assigned to them. It is worth bringing up that some fighters (such as Dan Henderson), can fight at two weight classes, which will be reiterated out in the lists below. Furthermore, certain fighters will be unlocks found in-game, as well as DLC only additions like referee \u201cBig\u201d John McCarthy. Anyways, here is the full EA MMA fighter list with each weight class separated for easier reading;\n\n## Heavyweight EA MMA Roster\n\n- Fedor Emelianenko\n- Fabricio Werdum\n- Alistair Overeem (LHW)\n- Hidehiko Yoshida\n- Bobby Lashley\n- Brett Rogers\n- Andrei Arlovski\n- Josh Barnett\n- Randy Couture (LHW)\n- Tim Sylvia\n- Jeff Monson\n- Andreas Kraniotakes\n- Bob Sapp\n- Herschel Walker (DLC)\n- John McCarthy (DLC)\n\n## Light Heavyweight Division\n\n- \u201cKing Mo\u201d Mohammed Lawal (HW)\n- Gegard Mousasi (MW)\n- Dan Henderson (MW)\n- Renato \u201cBabalu\u201d Sobral\n- Roger Gracie\n- Melvin Manhoef (MW)\n- Bas Rutten (HW)\n- Vladimir Matyushenko\n- Kevin Randleman (HW)\n- Ken Shamrock (HW)\n\n## Middleweight EA MMA Fighter List\n\n- Ronaldo \u201cJacare\u201d Souza\n- Tim Kennedy\n- Robbie Lawler (WW)\n- Cung Le\n- Matt Lindland (LHW, WW)\n- Kazuo Misaki (WW)\n- Murilo \u201cNinja\" Rua (LHW)\n- Frank Shamrock\n- Scott Smith (LHW)\n- Benji Radach\n- Luke Rockhold\n\n## Welterweight Division\n\n- Jake Shields (MW)\n- Nick Diaz (MW)\n- Jay Hieron\n- Tyron Woodley\n- Marius Zaromskis\n- Hayato \u201cMach\u201d Sakurai (LW)\n- Joe Riggs (MW)\n- Nick Thompson (MW)\n- Frank Trigg (MW)\n- Lyman Good (MW)\n- Pat Miletich (MW)\n\n## Lightweight EA MMA Fighter List\n\n- Gilbert Melendez\n- Eddie Alvarez\n- Josh Thompson\n- Shinya Aoki (WW)\n- Tatsuya Kawajiri (WW)\n- Satoru Kitaoka\n- Mizuto Hirota\n- Gesias \u201cJZ\" Cavalcante\n- Vitor \u201cShaolin\u201d Ribeiro\n- Kron Gracie\n- Joachim Hansen (WW)\n- Billy Evangelista\n\n## Classic Unlockables & DLC\n\n- Rickson Gracie\n- Frank Shamrock (DLC)\n- Randy Couture (UNLOCK)\n- Bas Rutten (UNLOCK)\n\n## EA MMA Fighter List & Promotion Information\n\nThat does it for the full EA MMA fighter list & roster. It seems many of the weight divisions lack depth in comparison to the UFC releases with light heavyweight to welterweight looking sparse. The chance to use fighter from both America & Japan is a big positive although only the Lightweight division seems to be utilising that dynamic with its strong Japanese representatives.\n\nThe license for the Japanese based MMA promotions may have fell away recently, but the Strikeforce banner is still prominent in the game, with the majority of the games roster fighting inside its promotional banner. The licenses may be missing on companies such as DREAM or World Victory Road\u2019s Sengoku brand, but the number of Japanese based fighters makes up for it, with fighter such as Shinya Aoki or Eddie Alvarez being included in the EA MMA roster. The game also sports two other fake promotions astride Strikeforce and the Japanese \u201cMystic\u201d, one in Brazil & the other in the UK, aptly named \u201cLiga De Combate\u201d and \u201cUnited Fighters League\u201d.\n\nWith two amateur organisations rounding off the selection of locations, cages, rings & other setting specific options, there is plenty to be said for this amount of promotional competition in the game, as opposed to UFC\u2019s one brand beats all mentality. Even if the overall EA MMA fighter list is a bit tepid & perhaps somewhat bare on the ground in comparison to UFC, it should provide enough diversity to get enjoyment out of it, especially with the proposed expansiveness of the fighter creation mode.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_AtJHOHY66YwkpIPtRsZTB4ZX\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Mauro Ranallo gave nickname announcer 'called him' 'nickname' 'Mauro Ranallo nickname' fighter 'called' 'Mauro Ranallo called' 'EA Sports MMA'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Mauro Ranallo - Wikipedia\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mauro_Ranallo\nIn 2015, Ranallo became the first sports broadcaster in history to call boxing, kickboxing, MMA and professional wrestling on U.S. national television.\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Mauro Ranallo - Pro Wrestling | Fandom\nURL: https:\/\/prowrestling.fandom.com\/wiki\/Mauro_Ranallo\nMauro Domenico Ranallo (December 21, 1969) is a Canadian sports announcer and commentator previously signed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Mauro Ranallo \"You best believe I'll be calling PRO WRESTLING ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SquaredCircle\/comments\/65rzi1\/mauro_ranallo_you_best_believe_ill_be_calling_pro\/\nI feel that Vince has a very complicated and odd insecurity about wrestling and how relates to actual combat sports.

I. An analysis of melt stress history in an extensional flow geometry\n\n#### Abstract\n\nA numerical and experimental analysis of the melt flow history of poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVF2, in an extensional flow, film\u2011processing geometry is presented. Numerical computations were carried out for both Newtonian and power law flow in an impinging channels die using a finite\u2011element technique. Computations demonstrate that a strong extensional flow exists in the region from the stream impingement point to a distance about 0.75 D downstream where D is the channel height at the impingement point. Measurements of the stress fields using the technique of flow birefringence showed that in consequence of the changing flow kinematics from the stream impingement region to the downstream converging channels region, both the isochromatic and isoclinic patterns exhibit a pronounced axial positional dependence. Excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement was found between measured and calculated shear stress fields. However, large differences were exhibited between calculated and measured normal stress differences along the symmetry axis of flow. Results to be presented in a companion paper (Part II) demonstrate that the strong extensional flow which occurs in this geometry is sufficient to produce oriented, row\u2011nucleated structures in the extruded PVF2 films.\n\n- Publication:\n-\nJournal of Applied Polymer Science\n- Pub Date:\n- August 1988\n- DOI:\n- Bibcode:\n- 1988JAPS...36..859K\n\n# Content from https:\/\/mrail.utk.edu\/publications\/\n## Khomami Publications\n\n### Book Chapters and Thesis\n\nA Unified Approach to Modeling Transport of Heat, Mass and Momentum in Processing of Polymer Matrix Composite Materials, B.

The challenge is to be able to link materials behavior and seek patterns among multiple length and time scales. Materials informatics and statistical learning techniques permit one to survey complex, multiscale information in an accelerated and statistically robust and yet meaningful manner. When this is coupled with advanced tools for computational thermodynamics and kinetic simulations, the result is a powerful computational infrastructure for materials design. This paper provides an overview of the value of this integrated approach to materials modeling in addressing the challenges in linking length scales.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nZ.-K.

The feasible region (the region where probabilities do not decay exponentially with time) grows linearly with time, as is the case with one-dimensional QRW. The limiting shape of the feasible region is, however, quite different. The limit region turns out to be an algebraic set, which we characterize as the rational image of a compact algebraic variety. We also compute the probability profile within the limit region, which is essentially a negative power of the Gaussian curvature of the same algebraic variety. Our methods are based on analysis of the space-time generating function, following the methods of Pemantle and Wilson (J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A 97(1):129\u2013161, 2002).\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nAharonov, Y., Davidovich, L., Zagury, N.: Quantum random walks. Phys. Rev.

means of\ngenerating functions. If one is lucky enough to obtain a closed form generating function, then the\nasymptotic enumeration formula, or probabilistic limit theorem is often not far behind. Recently,\nseveral problems have arisen to which can be associated very nice generating functions, in fact rational functions of several variables, but for which asymptotic estimates have not followed (although\nformulae were found in some cases by other means). These problems include random tilings (the\nso-called Aztec and Diabolo tilings) and other statistical mechanical ensembles (cube groves) as well\nas some enumerative and graph theoretic problems discussed later in the paper.\n\nA series of recent papers [PW02; PW04; BP04] provides a method for asymptotic evaluation of\nthe coe\ufb03cients of multivariate generating functions. To describe the scope of this previous work, we\nset up some notation that will be in force for the rest of this article. Throughout, we will assume\nthat the generating function converges in a domain de\ufb01ning there a quasirational function\n\nF (Z) =\n\nQ(Z)s\n\nP (Z)\nk\nj=1 Hj(Z)nj\n\n=\n\narZr\n\nr\nX\n\n(1.1)\n\nQ\n\nwith polynomial P, Q, a\ufb03ne-linear Hj\u2019s, integer nj\u2019s and real s. (Here the quantities in boldface\nj=1 Z rj\nare vectors of dimension d and the notation Zr is used to denote\nj .) In dimension three\nCd\nand below, we use X, Y, Z to denote Z1, Z2 and Z3 respectively. We let\n:=\ndenote the pole variety of F , that is, the complex algebraic variety where Q vanishes (Q will always\nbe a polynomial). Analytic methods for recovering asymptotics of ar from F always begin with the\nmultivariate Cauchy integral formula\n\nZ : Q(Z) = 0\n\n} \u2286\n\nQ\n\nV\n\n{\n\nd\n\nar =\n\n1\n(2\u03c0i)d\n\nZ\u2212rF\n\ndZ\nZ\n\n.\n\n(1.2)\n\nZT\nHere T is a d-torus, i.e. the product of circles about the origin in each coordinate axis (importantly,\nchoice of a torus a\ufb00ects the corresponding Laurent expansion (1.1)). The pole set\nis of central\nimportance because the contour T may be deformed without a\ufb00ecting the integral as long as one\navoids places where the integrand is singular.\n\nV\n\nWhen\n\nis smooth or has singularities of self-intersection type (where locally\n\nis the union\nis smooth is analyzed\nof smooth divisors), a substantial amount is known. The case where\nin [PW02]; the existence under further hypotheses of a local central limit theorem dates back at\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\n1\n\n\n\n---\n\nare all unions of smooth\nleast as far as [BR83]. The more general case where the singular points of\ncomponents with normal intersections is analyzed using explicit changes of variables in [PW04]\nand by multivariate residues in [BP04], the pre-cursor to which is [BM93]. Applications in which\nsatis\ufb01es these conditions are abundant, and a number of examples are worked in [PW08]. For\nV\nbivariate generating functions, all rational generating functions we have seen fall within this class.\nOther local geometries are possible, namely those of irreducible monomial curve, e.g., X p\nY q = 0,\nbut, as will become clear, they cannot contribute to the asymptotic expansions, being non-hyperbolic.\n\n\u2212\n\nV\n\nIn dimension three and above, there are many further possibilities. The simplest case not handled\nby previous techniques is that of isolated quadratic singularity. The purpose of this paper is to\naddress this type of generating function. All the examples Section 4 are of this type. In fact, all\nthe rational 3-variable generating functions we know of, that are not one of the types previous\nanalyzed, have isolated, usually quadratic, singularities. The simplest case is when the denominator\nis irreducible and its variety has a single, isolated quadratic singularity; a concrete example in\ndimension d = 3 is the cube grove creation generating function, whose denominator Q = 1 + XY Z\n(X + Y + Z + XY + Y Z + ZX)\/3 has the zero set illustrated in \ufb01gure 1.\n\n\u2212\n\nFigure 1: an isolated quadratic singularity\n\nThe main results of this paper, Theorems 3.7 and 3.9 below, are asymptotic formulae for the\ncoe\ufb03cients of a generating function having a divisor with this geometry. In addition to one or more\nisolated quadratic singularities, our most general results allow Q to be taken to an arbitrary real\npower and we allow the possibility of other smooth divisors passing through the singularities of Q.\nThese generalizations complicate the exposition somewhat but are necessary to handle some of the\nmotivating examples.\n\nAs a preview of the behavior of the coe\ufb03cients, consider the case d = 3 and F = 1\/Q illustrated\nin \ufb01gure 1. The leading homogeneous term of Q in the variables (x, y, z) = (log X, log Y, log Z) is\nxy + xz + yz. The outward normal cone (dual cone) at this point is the cone N\u2217 on which Q\u2217\n0,\n2(r2 + s2 + t2) is the dual quadratic to Q (see Section 2.6 for\nwhere Q\u2217(r, s, t) = (r + s + t)2\n\n\u2265\n\n\u2212\n\n2\n\n\n\n---\n\nde\ufb01nitions). The asymptotics for ar in this example are given by Corollary 3.8 for r in the interior\nof N\u2217 and by an easier result (Proposition 2.23) when r \/\n\u2208\n\nN\u2217:\n\nar\n\n\u223c \uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\nCQ\u2217(r)\u22121\/2\n\nif r is in the interior of N\u2217\n\nexponentially small\n\nif r \/\n\u2208\n\nN\u2217\n\n\uf8f3\n\nThe behavior of ar near \u2202N\u2217 is more complicated and is not dealt with in this paper. The generating\nfunction 1\/Q is the creation rate generating function for cube groves, discussed in Section 4.2. The\nedge placement generating function for cube groves (edge placement probabilities have more direct\ninterpretations than do creation rates) has an extra factor of (1\nZ) in the denominator. Theorem 3.9\ngives the asymptotics in this case, for r interior to N\u2217, as\n\n\u2212\n\nar\n\n\u223c\n\nC arctan \u03b8(r)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a homogeneous degree 0 function of r which can be expressed in terms of dual quadratic\nform Q\u2217. Homogeneity of \u03b8 implies that that there is a limit theorem a\u03bbr\n, where\n\u02c6r := r\/\n\nis the unit vector in the direction r.\n\n\u03b8(\u02c6r) as \u03bb\n\n\u2192 \u221e\n\n\u2192\n\nr\n|\n\n|\n\nA total of \ufb01ve motivating applications will be discussed in detail in Section 4. All of these may\nbe seen to have factors with isolated quadratic singularities. There are known trivariate rational\ngenerating functions with isolated singularities that are not quadratic. For example, the diabolo\nor fortress tiling ensemble has an isolated quartic singularity [DGIP11]. Some of our results apply\nto this case, but a detailed analysis will be left for another paper. The last example goes slightly\nbeyond what we do in this paper, but we include it because the analysis follows largely the same\nmethods.\n\nAztec diamond placement probability generating function [JPS98]\n\nF (X, Y, Z) =\n\nZ\/2\n\nY Z)(1\n\n(1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n2 (X + X \u22121 + Y + Y \u22121) + Z 2)\n\n.\n\n(1.3)\n\nCube groves edge probability generating function [PS05]\n\nF (X, Y, Z) =\n\n3(1\n\n\u2212\n\nZ)(1 + XY Z\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n3 (X + Y + Z + XY + XZ + Y Z))\n\n2Z 2\n\n.\n\n(1.4)\n\nQuantum random walk space-time probability generating function [ABN+01; BBBP08]\n\nF (X, Y, Z) =\n\nXZ\n\nZ 2)(1\n\n(1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n(1 + XY )Z 2 + Y Z 3)\n\n\u2212\n(X + X \u22121 + Y + Y \u22121)Z\/2 + Z 2)\n\n.\n\n(1.5)\n\n3\n\n\n\n---\n\nFriedrichs-Lewy-Szeg\u00a8o graph polynomial\n\n[SS06]\n\nF (X, Y, Z) = [(1\n\nX)(1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nY ) + (1\n\nX)(1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nZ) + (1\n\nY )(1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nZ)]\u2212\u03b2\n\n(1.6)\n\nMulti-set permutation generating function [Ges92]\n\nG(X, Y, Z) =\n\nX\n\n1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nY\n\n1\n\n\u2212\n\nZ + 4XY Z\n\n.\n\n(1.7)\n\n1.2 Methods and organization\n\nOur methods of analysis owe a great debt to two bodies of existing theory. Our approach to\nharmonic analysis of cones is fashioned after the work of [ABG70]. We not only quote their results\non generalized Fourier transforms, which date back somewhat farther to computations of [Rie49] and\ngeneralized function theory as described in [GS64], but we also employ their results on hyperbolic\npolynomials to produce homotopies of various contours. Secondly, our understanding of the existence\nof these homotopies has been greatly informed by Morse theoretic results of [GM88]. We do not\nquote these results directly because our setting does not satisfy all their hypotheses, but the idea to\npiece together deformations local to strata is really the central idea behind strati\ufb01ed Morse theory\nas explained in [GM88]; see also the discussion of strati\ufb01ed critical points in Section 2.5.\n\nAn outline our methods is as follows. The chain of integration in the multivariate Cauchy\n.\n}\n, the set of points\n\nintegral (1.2) is a d-dimensional torus T embedded in the complex torus (C\u2217)d, where C\u2217 := C\nChanging variables by Zj = exp(zj), the chain of integration becomes a chain\nwith a \ufb01xed real part. Under this change of variables, the Cauchy integral (1.2) becomes\n\n\u2212{\n\nC\n\n0\n\nexp(\n\n\u2212\n\nr\n\n\u00b7\n\nz)f (z) dz\n\n(1.8)\n\nZC\n\n\u25e6\n\nexp. Letting z := x + iy, Morse theoretic considerations tell us we can deform the\nwhere f := F\nchain of integration so that it is supported by the region where e\u2212r\u00b7x is small (for large\n) except\nnear certain critical points. To elaborate, we can accomplish most of the deformation by moving\nx. The allowable region for such deformations of x is a component of the complement to amoeba\nof F (see Section 2.1 for de\ufb01nitions). Heuristically, we move x to the support point xmin on the\nboundary of this region for a hyperplane orthogonal to r (see Sections 2.5 and those preceding for\ndetails). Unfortunately, when xmin is on the boundary, (1.8) fails to be integrable. Ignoring this,\nexp and we denote\nhowever, and continuing with the heuristic, we let q := Q\nthe leading homogeneous parts of q and hj by \u02dcq and \u02dchj respectively. We then express f near xmin\nas a series in negative powers of \u02dcq and \u02dchj (this is carried out in Section 2.7). Integrating term by\nterm, each integral has the form\n\nexp and hj := Hj \u25e6\n\nr\n|\n\n\u25e6\n\n|\n\nexp(\n\n\u2212\n\nz)\n\nr\n\n\u00b7\n\nZC\n\nzm\n\u02dcq(z)s\u02dch(z)n\n\ndz\n\n4\n\n\n\n---\n\nk\n\nj=1 hnj\n\nwhere \u02dchn :=\nj . Replacing z by iz, we recognize the Fourier transform of a product of\na monomial with inverse powers of quadratics and linear functions. The Fourier transform of an\ninverse quadratic is the dual quadratic and the Fourier transform of a linear function is the Heaviside\nfunction. The Fourier transform of a product is a convolution. These facts tell us what result to\nexpect.\n\nQ\n\nMuch of what has been described thus far is based on known methods and results, most of which\nare collected in the preliminary Section 2. The bulk of the work, however, is in making rigorous\nthese identities which involve Fourier integrals that do not converge, taken over regions which are\nnot obviously deformations of each other (the part above where we said, \u201cignoring this, . . .\u201d). For\nthis purpose, some carefully chosen deformations are constructed, based largely on deformations\nfound in Sections 5 and 6 of [ABG70]. Speci\ufb01cally, we use results on hyperbolic polynomials (see\nSection 2.3 for de\ufb01nitions) established in [ABG70] and elsewhere, to construct certain vector \ufb01elds\non Cd. These vector \ufb01elds, based on the construction of [ABG70, Section 5] and described in our\nSection 5.1, then allow us to construct deformations in Section 5.2, which satisfy several properties.\nFirst, they enact what Morse theory has guaranteed: they push the chain of integration to where\nthe integrand of (1.8) is very small, except near critical points, as in \ufb01gure 2 below. Secondly, they\ndo this without intersecting\n, thereby allowing the integral to remain the same. This localizes the\nintegral to the critical points, and allows us to concentrate on one critical point at a time. The\nresulting chain of integration is depicted in \ufb01gure 2.\n\nV\n\nReal part = xmax\n\n(a) in log space\n\n(b) in the original domain\n\nFigure 2: the localizing chain, in logarithmic and original coordinates\n\nThirdly, they allow us to \u201cstraighten out\u201d the chain of integration. Figure 3 shows that the\nchains in \ufb01gure 2, as well as the original chain, are homotopic near the critical point to a (slightly\nperturbed) conical chain.\n\nCombined with the series expansion by homogeneous functions, this reduces all necessary integrals to a small class of Fourier-type integrals. Many of these are evaluated as generalized functions in [ABG70; Rie49; GS64] and elsewhere. In Section 6.2 and 6.3 we summarize the relevant\nfacts about generalized functions. The above deformations allow us to show, in Sections 6.4 \u2013 6.6,\n\n5\n\n\n\n---\n\nReal part = u\n\nFigure 3: the projective chain\n\nthat these generalized functions, de\ufb01ned as integrals over the straight contour on the left of \ufb01gure 3,\ndo approximate the integrals we are interested in, which we must evaluate over the chains shown on\nthe right of \ufb01gure 2 and on \ufb01gure 3 in order for the localizations to remain valid. Not all of the computations we need are available in the literature. In Section 6.6 we use a construction from [ABG70],\n\u02dch)\nthe Leray cycle, along with a residue computation, to reduce the Fourier transform of 1\/(\u02dcq\nto an explicitly computable one-dimensional integral. It is this computation that is responsible for\nthe explicit asymptotic formula for placement probabilities in the Aztec Diamond and Cube Grove\nproblems.\n\n\u00b7\n\nTo summarize, the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 de\ufb01nes some\nnotation in use throughout the paper, and collects preliminary results on amoebas, convex duals,\nhyperbolicity, and expansions by powers of homogeneous polynomials. Section 3 states the main\nresults. Section 4 has \ufb01ve subsections, each discussing one of the \ufb01ve examples. The next two\nsections are concerned with the proofs of the main results. Section 5 constructs homotopies that\nshift contours of integration, while Section 6 evaluates several classes of integrals via the theory of\ngeneralized Four\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from

He built similar structures on every route his army followed. This Baoli was source of fresh water not only for humans but it was built in a way that animals as huge as an elephants could go down to drink water directly from the Well. The people started settling in the area due to availability of fresh water and the first tribe which settled there was \"Bachar Tribe\u201d, which contributed to the name of \"Wan Bhachran\u201d to this place meaning \"The Well of Bachars\u201d. According to reliable sources, the place was named as \"Khichi\u201d before the colonial period but was later recognised as \"Wan Bhachran\u201d. Bhachar, Miana Bhatti Thethia rajputs and Ghanjera are very main tribes of this area**\n\n**Current State**\n\nWan Bhacran is now a modern town with Higher Secondary School for Boys and Girls schools up to Matric. It has its own Digital Telephone Exchange and serves as a hub for many small villages around. The name of Wan Bhachran is well known in the politics of Mianwali District, as on several occasions, candidates from Wan Bhacran have been elected as member of Provincial Assembly.\n\nThe \"Baoli\u201d (water well) is still there, though water wells are no more in use and the condition of the Well is deteriorating. Appropriate measures should be taken to preserve the Well as a historical monument.\n\n\n**Tribes & Castes**\n\n1) Bhachar The Bachhars are Khokhar Rajputs. They state that their original home was in the Gujrat District, whence they moved, first to Buggi Bhooki near Girot in Sargodha District, and later to their present site, which was chosen on account of the \"wan\u201d or large well said to be built by the Emperor Sher Shah Suri. These wells were placed at intervals of about a day\u2019s march apart on the road from Gujrat to Bannu and the North West Frontier Province. The name \"Bachhar\u201d seems to have been a form of endearment applied to them by some forgotten Pir. Their circumstances have been much changed of late, owing to their discovery that the soil of Thal was most suitable for the cultivation of gram. In appearance and general characteristics, they resemble the people of the Mianwali District.\n\n2) Miana The Miana clan living at Wan Bhachran originated from Pindi Bhattian. They are Bhatti Rajput by caste. According their pedigree chart and the famous book Punjab ka muqadma by Hanif Ramay they are directly descended from the famous Rai Abdullah Khan Bhatti mostly known as Dulla Bhatti whose one son was sent away as punishment from Mughal King Akbar. Who came here and settled here along with some of his tribal subjects and started living as a landlord. He fought with the neighbouring clans and took over their land. But somehow, his generations couldn\u2019t be prevalent here and most of them died in young ages or early adulthood. So, they are not in mass numbers here but always have been noted for their bravery and nobleness. They are said to be Miana, because their ancestor was a holy man who stopped fighting with the tribes over the land and became a holy man. Some Miana living in Wan Bhachran use title of Malik while others still use Mian with their names.\n\n3) {Ghanjera} it is an offshoot of Bhachars.\n\nGhanjera tribe is much famous because of bravery and strength. Their origin is khokhar awan and came from shah pur near jehlam river, first they settled in wan bhachran but left after conflict with bhachers. The bandial are also khokhar awan and both are offshoots of awans.\n\n\n**Famous personalities\nMalik Ahmed Khan Bhacher Leader Muslim Leeg N Mianwali Famous Landlard.\nMian Abdul Razaq Miana Bhatti Shaheed (Air Vice Marshal.

The tributaries like Gilgit, Hunza, and Zaskar originate in the Himalayan region, contributing significantly to the Indus River system.\nQ: Which river forms the boundary between India and Pakistan?\nA: Geography. The Ravi River, a transboundary river of India and Pakistan, is an integral part of the Indus River Basin and forms the headwaters of the Indus basin. The waters of the Ravi River drain into the Arabian Sea (Indian Ocean) through the Indus River in Pakistan.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_3eVcWuu18fYJrm3G3UooX9nD\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gomal_River\\\",\\\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indus_River\\\",\\\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isa_Khel_Tehsil\\\",\\\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wan_Bhachran\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gomal_River\n# Gomal River\n\n| Gomal | |\n|---|---|\n| Location | |\n| Countries | Afghanistan and Pakistan |\n| Provinces | |\n| Physical characteristics | |\n| Source | |\n| \u2022 location | Katawaz Region, Gomal District, Paktika Province, Afghanistan |\n| \u2022 coordinates | 32\u00b030\u203211\u2033N 68\u00b054\u203205\u2033E \/ 32.502974\u00b0N 68.901294\u00b0E |\n| Mouth | Indus River |\n\u2022 location | Dera Ismail Khan, Dera Ismail Khan District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan |\n\u2022 coordinates | 31\u00b036\u203253\u2033N 70\u00b050\u203246\u2033E \/ 31.61472\u00b0N 70.84611\u00b0E |\n| Length | 400 km (250 mi) |\n| Basin features | |\n| Progression | Indus\u2192 Arabian Sea |\n| Tributaries | |\n| \u2022 left | Wana Khwar |\n| \u2022 right | Zhob River |\n\nThe **Gomal** (Urdu: \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0626\u06d2 \u06af\u0648\u0645\u0644, Pashto: \u06ab\u0648\u0645\u0644 \u0633\u06cc\u0646\u062f\u060c \u06ab\u0648\u0645\u0644 \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0628) is a 400-kilometre-long (250 mi) river in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It rises in northern Afghanistan's Paktika Province and joins the Indus River 20 miles south of Dera Ismail Khan, in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nGomal University in Dera Ismail Khan and Gomal District in Afghanistan's Paktika province are named after the river.\n\n## Etymology\n\n[edit]The name *Gomal* is thought to have derived from the river *Gomati*, which is mentioned in the *Rigveda*.[1]\n\n## Course\n\n[edit]Gomal River's headwaters are located in the northern part of Paktika Province, southeast of the city of Ghazni. The springs which form the headwaters of the Gomal's main branch emerge above the fort at Babakarkol in Katawaz, a district in Paktika inhabited by Ghilji Pashtuns from the Kharoti and Sulaimankhel clans.[2] The Gomal's other branch, the \"Second Gomal\", joins the main channel about 14 miles below its source.[3] The Gomal flows southeast through the eastern Ghilji country before entering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.[4][5]\n\nWithin Pakistan, the Gomal River forms the boundary between South Waziristan and Balochistan. Approximately 110 miles from its source, it merges with the Zhob River, its major tributary, near Khajuri Kach.[4][5]\n\nIt is about 100 miles from the Zhob River to the Indus River. The river enters the Gomal Valley in Tank District at a place known as Girdavi, which is inhabited by the Miani Pashtuns. It is mainly here that the water of Gomal is used to cultivate the lands in the Gomal Valley through Zam System (Rod Kohi). The river passes then through the Damaan plain in Kulachi Tehsil and later on through Dera Ismail Khan Tehsil. It joins the Indus River 20 miles south of the city of Dera Ismail Khan.[5]\n\n## Gomal Zam Dam\n\n[edit]The damming of this river at Khajuri Kachh was envisaged as far back as 1898, even after its administrative approval by the Government of Pakistan in 1963. Work on the Gomal Zam Dam was stopped in 1965; not to restart till 2001 during the rule of Pervez Musharraf.[6] It was opened and inaugurated in 2013.[7]\n\nA street in E-7 sector, Islamabad, is called Gomal Road.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- Gomal Zam Dam\n- Gomal Pass\n- Gomal District\n- Gomal University\n- Zhob River\n- South Waziristan\n- Paktika Province\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]**^**Sinha, Ram Nandan Prasad (1990).*Environment and Human Response: Selected Essays in Geography*.

Its principal right-bank tributaries are the Shyok, Gilgit, Kabul, Kurram, and Gomal rivers. Beginning in a mountain spring and fed with glaciers and rivers in the Himalayan, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush ranges, the river supports the ecosystems of temperate forests, plains, and arid countryside.\n\nGeologically, the headwaters of the Indus and to their east those of the Yarlung Tsangpo (later in its course, the Brahmaputra) flow along the Indus-Yarlung suture zone, which defines the boundary along which the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate in the Early Eocene (approximately 50 Million years ago).[15] These two Eurasian rivers, whose courses were continually diverted by the rising Himalayas, define the western and eastern limits, respectively, of the mountain range.[15] After the Indus debouches from its narrow Himalayan valley, it forms, along with its tributaries, the Punjab region of South Asia. The lower course of the river ends in a large delta in the Sindh province of Pakistan.\n\nHistorically, the Indus was important to many cultures. The 3rd millennium BC saw the rise of Indus Valley Civilisation, a major urban civilization of the Bronze Age. During the 2nd millennium BC, the Punjab region was mentioned in the Rigveda hymns as *Sapta Sindhu* and in the Avesta religious texts as *Hapta H\u0259ndu* (both terms meaning \"seven rivers\"). Early historical kingdoms that arose in the Indus Valley include Gandh\u0101ra and Sindhu-Sauv\u012bra. The Indus River came into the knowledge of the Western world early in the classical period, when King Darius of Persia sent his Greek subject Scylax of Caryanda to explore the river, c. 515 BC.[16]\n\n## Etymology and names\n\n[edit]The English language word \"Indus\" comes from Late Latin Indus (1598), specifically a use of classical Latin *Indus* (inhabitant of India, Indian) from ancient Greek \u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2 \"inhabitant of India, Indian, the River Indus\" from Achaemenian Old Persian \"hindu,\" denoting an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire (Persian language *hind* India), and Avestan *hi\u1e47du*, *h\u0259\u1e47du* \"river,\" (natural) frontier; with same Proto Indo-Iranian language-root as Sanskrit sindhu (river), specifically the River Indus; hence also the region of the Indus, the province Sindh (which also developed into Hellenistic Greek \u03a3\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (\"the River Indus\").[17][18] This river's traditional name in Sanskrit and Tibetan is \"sindhu\". In Sanskrit, its range of meanings includes: stream, river; Indus; flood; sea or ocean; region or country in the vicinity of the Indus, Sindh, people of Sindh.\"[19][20]\n\nThe modern name in Urdu is *Sindh* (Urdu: \u0633\u0646\u062f\u06be) or *Dary\u0101-i-Sindh* (Urdu: \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0626\u06d2 \u0633\u0646\u062f\u06be, lit. 'The River Sindh'), contrasting to the Province of Sindh (Urdu: \u0635\u0648\u0628\u06c1\u0650 \u0633\u0646\u062f\u06be, romanized: *S\u016bba-i-sindh*). The Ladakhis and Tibetans call the river *Senge Tsangpo* (\u0f66\u0f7a\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f59\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7c\u0f0d), Baltis call it *Gemtsuh* and *Tsuh-Fo*, Pashtuns call it *Nilab*, *Sher Darya* and *Abbasin*, while Sindhis call it *Sindhu*, *Mehran*, *Purali* and *Samundar*.[12][21]\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]The Indus River provides key water resources for Pakistan's economy \u2013 especially the *breadbasket* of Punjab province, which accounts for most of the nation's agricultural production. The word Punjab means \"land of five rivers\" and the five rivers are Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, all of which finally flow into the Indus. The Indus also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of potable water in Pakistan.\n\nThe total length of the river varies in different sources. The length used in this article is 3,180 km (1,980 mi), taken from the *Himalayan Climate and Water Atlas* (2015).[4] Historically, the 1909 *The Imperial Gazetteer of India* gave it as \"just over 1,800 miles\".[22] A shorter figure of 2,880 km (1,790 mi) has been widely used in modern sources, as has the one of 3,180 km (1,980 mi). The modern *Encyclopedia Britannica* was originally published in 1999 with the shorter measurement, but was updated in 2015 to use the longer measurement.[12] Both lengths are commonly found in modern publications; in some cases, both measurements can be found within the same work.[23] An extended figure of circa 3,600 km (2,200 mi) was announced by a Chinese research group in 2011, based on a comprehensive remeasurement from satellite imagery, and a ground expedition to identify an alternative source point, but detailed analysis has not yet been published.[24]\n\nThe ultimate source of the Indus is in Tibet, but there is some debate about the exact source. The traditional source of the river is the *S\u00eangg\u00ea Kanbab* (S\u00eangg\u00ea Zangbo) or \"Lion's Mouth\", a perennial spring not far from the sacred Mount Kailash, marked by a long low line of Tibetan chortens. There are several other tributaries nearby, which may form a longer stream than S\u00eangg\u00ea Kanbab, but unlike the S\u00eangg\u00ea Kanbab, are all dependent on snowmelt. The Zanskar River, which flows into the Indus in Ladakh, has a greater volume of water than the Indus itself before that point.[25] An alternative reckoning begins the river around 300 km further upstream, at the confluence of the *S\u00eangg\u00ea* Zangbo and Gar Tsangpo rivers, which drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan (Gang Rinpoche, Mt. Kailash) mountain ranges. The 2011 remeasurement suggested the source was a small lake northeast of Mount Kailash, rather than either of the two points previously used.[24]\n\nThe Indus then flows northwest through Ladakh (Indian-administered Kashmir) and Baltistan and Gilgit (Pakistan-administered Kashmir), just south of the Karakoram range. The Shyok, Shigar and Gilgit rivers carry glacial waters into the main river. It gradually bends to the south and descends into the Punjab plains at Kalabagh, Pakistan. The Indus passes gigantic gorges 4,500\u20135,200 metres (15,000\u201317,000 ft) deep near the Nanga Parbat massif. It flows swiftly across Hazara and is dammed at the Tarbela Reservoir. The Kabul River joins it near Attock. The remainder of its route to the sea is in the plains of the Punjab[26] and Sindh, where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided. It is joined by the Panjnad at Mithankot. Beyond this confluence, the river, at one time, was named the *Satnad River* (*sat* = \"seven\", *nad\u012b* = \"river\"), as the river now carried the waters of the Kabul River, the Indus River and the five Punjab rivers. When the river passes Jamshoro, it ends in a large delta to the South of Thatta in the Sindh province of Pakistan.\n\nThe Indus is one of the few rivers in the world to exhibit a tidal bore. The Indus system is largely fed by the snow and glaciers of the Himalayas, Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges. The flow of the river is also determined by the seasons \u2013 it diminishes greatly in the winter while flooding its banks in the monsoon months from July to September. There is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times \u2013 it deviated westwards from flowing into the Rann of Kutch and adjoining Banni grasslands after the 1816 earthquake.[27][28] As of 2011[update], Indus water flows in to the Rann of Kutch during its floods breaching flood banks.[29]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation, such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, date back to around 3300 BC, and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world. The Indus Valley Civilisation extended from across northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India,[30] with an upward reach from east of the Jhelum River to Ropar on the upper Sutlej. The coastal settlements extended from Sutkagan Dor at the Pakistan-Iran border to Kutch in modern Gujarat, India. There is an Indus site on the Amu Darya at Shortughai in northern Afghanistan, and the Indus site Alamgirpur at the Hindon River is located only 28 km (17 mi) from Delhi. To date, over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, as well as Lothal, Dholavira, Ganeriwala, and Rakhigarhi. Only 40 Indus Valley sites have been discovered on the Indus and its tributaries.[31] However, it is notable that majority of the Indus script seals and inscribed objects discovered were found at sites along the Indus river.[b][32][33]\n\nSome scholars believe that settlements of Gandhara grave culture of the early Indo-Aryans flourished in Gandhara from 1700 BC to 600 BC, when Mohenjo-daro and Harappa had already been abandoned.[ citation needed]\n\nThe Rigveda describes several rivers, including one named \"Sindhu\". The Rigvedic \"Sindhu\" is thought to be the present-day Indus River. It is attested 176 times in its text, 94 times in the plural, and most often used in the generic sense of \"river\". In the Rigveda, notably in the later hymns, the meaning of the word is narrowed to refer to the Indus River in particular; for example, in the list of rivers mentioned in the hymn of *Nadistuti sukta*. The Rigvedic hymns apply a feminine gender to all the rivers mentioned therein, except for the Brahmaputra.\n\nThe word \"India\" is derived from the Indus River. In ancient times, \"India\" initially referred to those regions immediately along the east bank of the Indus, where are Punjab and Sindh now but by 300 BC, Greek writers including Herodotus and Megasthenes were applying the term to the entire subcontinent that extends much farther eastward.[34][35]\n\nThe lower basin of the Indus forms a natural boundary between the Iranian Plateau and the Indian subcontinent; this region embraces all or parts of the Pakistani provinces Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh and the countries Afghanistan and India. The first West Eurasian empire to annex the Indus Valley was the Persian Empire, during the reign of Darius the Great. During his reign, the Greek explorer Scylax of Caryanda was commissioned to explore the course of the Indus. It was crossed by the invading armies of Alexander. Still, after his Macedonians conquered the west bank\u2014joining it to the Hellenic world, they elected to retreat along the southern course of the river, ending Alexander's Asian campaign. Alexander's admiral Nearchus set out from the Indus Delta to explore the Persian Gulf, until reaching the Tigris. The Indus Valley was later dominated by the Mauryan and Kushan Empires, Indo-Greek Kingdoms, Indo-Scythians and Hepthalites. Over several centuries Muslim armies of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad of Ghor, Timur and Babur crossed the river to invade Sindh and Punjab, providing a gateway to the Indian subcontinent.\n\n## Geology\n\n[edit]The Indus River is an antecedent river, meaning that it existed before the Himalayas and entrenched itself while they were rising.\n\nThe Indus River feeds the Indus submarine fan, which is the second largest sediment body on Earth.[36] It consists of around 5 million cubic kilometers of material eroded from the mountains. Studies of the sediment in the modern river indicate that the Karakoram Mountains in northern Pakistan and India are the single most important source of material, with the Himalayas providing the next largest contribution, mostly via the large rivers of the Punjab (Jhelum, Ravi, Chenab, Beas and Sutlej). Analysis of sediments from the Arabian Sea has demonstrated that five million years ago the Indus was not connected to these Punjab rivers which instead flowed east into the Ganga and were captured after that time.[37] Earlier work showed that sand and silt from western Tibet was reaching the Arabian Sea by 45 million years ago, implying the existence of an ancient Indus River by that time.[38] The delta of this proto-Indus River has subsequently been found in the Katawaz Basin, on the Afghan-Pakistan border.\n\nIn the Nanga Parbat region, the massive amounts of erosion due to the Indus River following the capture and rerouting through that area are thought to bring middle and lower crustal rocks to the surface.[39]\n\nIn November 2011, satellite images showed that the Indus River had re-entered India and was feeding the Great Rann of Kutch, Little Rann of Kutch and a lake near Ahmedabad known as Nal Sarovar.[29] Heavy rains had left the river basin along with the Lake Manchar, Lake Hemal and Kalri Lake (all in modern-day Pakistan) inundated. This happened two centuries after the Indus River shifted its course westwards following the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake.\n\nThe Induan Age at the start of the Triassic Period of geological time is named for the Indus region.\n\n### Tributaries\n\n[edit]## Wildlife\n\n[edit]Accounts of the Indus Valley from the times of Alexander's campaign indicate a healthy forest cover in the region. The Mughal Emperor Babur writes of encountering rhinoceroses along its bank in his memoirs (the Baburnama). Extensive deforestation and human interference in the ecology of the Shivalik Hills has led to a marked deterioration in vegetation and growing conditions. The Indus Valley regions are arid with poor vegetation. Agriculture is sustained largely due to irrigation works. The Indus River and its watershed have a rich biodiversity. It is home to around 25 amphibian species.[40]\n\n### Mammals\n\n[edit]The Indus River dolphin (*Platanista indicus minor*) is found only in the Indus River. It is a subspecies of the South Asian river dolphin. The Indus River dolphin formerly also occurred in the tributaries of the Indus River. According to the World Wildlife Fund it is one of the most threatened cetaceans with only about 1,816 still existing.[41] It is threatened by habitat degradation from the construction of dams and canals, entanglement in fishing gear, and industrial water pollution.[42]\n\nThere are two otter species in the Indus River basin: the Eurasian otter in the northeastern highland sections and the smooth-coated otter elsewhere in the river basin. The smooth-coated otters in the Indus River represent a subspecies found nowhere else, the Sindh otter (*Lutrogale perspicillata sindica*).[43]\n\n### Fish\n\n[edit]The Indus River basin has high diversity, being the home of more than 180 freshwater fish species,[44] including 22 which are found nowhere else.[40] Fish also played a major role in earlier cultures of the region, including the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation where depictions of fish were frequent. The Indus script has a commonly used fish sign, which in its various forms may simply have meant \"fish\", or referred to stars or gods.[45]\n\nIn the uppermost, highest part of the Indus River basin there are relatively few genera and species: *Diptychus*, *Ptychobarbus*, *Schizopyge*, *Schizopygopsis* and *Schizothorax* snowtrout, *Triplophysa* loaches, and the catfish *Glyptosternon reticulatum*.[44] Going downstream these are soon joined by the golden mahseer *Tor putitora* (alternatively *T. macrolepis*, although it often is regarded as a synonym of *T. putitora*) and *Schistura* loaches. Downriver from around Thakot, Tarbela, the Kabul\u2013Indus river confluence, Attock Khurd and Peshawar the diversity rises strongly, including many cyprinids (*Amblypharyngodon*, *Aspidoparia*, *Barilius*, *Chela*, *Cirrhinus*, *Crossocheilus*, *Cyprinion*, *Danio*, *Devario*, *Esomus*, *Garra*, *Labeo*, *Naziritor*, *Osteobrama*, *Pethia*, *Puntius*, *Rasbora*, *Salmophasia*, *Securicula* and *Systomus*), true loaches (*Botia* and *Lepidocephalus*), stone loaches (*Acanthocobitis* and *Nemacheilus*), ailiid catfish (*Clupisoma*), bagridae catfish (*Batasio*, *Mystus*, *Rita* and *Sperata*), airsac catfish (*Heteropneustes*), schilbid catfish (*Eutropiichthys*), silurid catfish (*Ompok* and *Wallago*), sisorid catfish (*Bagarius*, *Gagata*, *Glyptothorax* and *Sisor*), gouramis (*Trichogaster*), nandid leaffish (*Nandus*), snakeheads (*Channa*), spiny eel (*Macrognathus* and *Mastacembelus*), knifefish (*Notopterus*), glassfish (*Chanda* and *Parambassis*), clupeids (*Gudusia*), needlefish (*Xenentodon*) and gobies (*Glossogobius*), as well as a few introduced species.[44] As the altitude further declines the Indus basin becomes overall quite slow-flowing as it passes through the Punjab Plain. Major carp become common, and chameleonfish (*Badis*), mullet (*Sicamugil*) and swamp eel (*Monopterus*) appear.[44] In some upland lakes and tributaries of the Punjab region snow trout and mahseer are still common, but once the Indus basin reaches its lower plain the former group is absent and the latter are rare.[44] Many of the species of the middle sections of the Indus basin are also present in the lower. Notable examples of genera that are present in the lower plain but generally not elsewhere in the Indus River basin are the *Aphanius* pupfish, *Aplocheilus* killifish, palla fish (*Tenualosa ilisha*), catla (*Labeo catla*), rohu (*Labeo rohita*) and *Cirrhinus mrigala*.[44] The lowermost part of\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isa_Khel_Tehsil\n# Isakhel Tehsil\n\nIsakhel Tehsil\n\u062a\u062d\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0644 \u0639\u0650\u064a\u0633\u0649\u0670 \u062e\u064a\u0644 | |\n|---|---|\nTehsil | |\n| Country | Pakistan |\n| Region | Punjab |\n| District | Mianwali District |\n| Capital | Isakhel |\n| Towns | 3 |\n| Union councils | 13 |\n| Area | |\n\u2022 Tehsil | 1,863 km2 (719 sq mi) |\n| Population (2023) | |\n\u2022 Tehsil | 414,100 |\n| \u2022 Density | 222.3\/km2 (575.7\/sq mi) |\n| \u2022 Urban | 94,541 (22.83%) |\n| \u2022 Rural | 319,559 (77.17%) |\n| Time zone | UTC+5 (PST) |\n\n**Isakhel Tehsil** (Urdu: \u062a\u062d\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0644 \u0639\u0650\u064a\u0633\u0649\u0670 \u062e\u064a\u0644) is an administrative subdivision (tehsil) of Mianwali District in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The city of Isakhel is the headquarters of the tehsil which is administratively subdivided into 3 Municipal Committees and 13 Union Councils.[1] It is located between 32\u00b0 30\u2032 and 33\u00b0 14\u2032 N. and 71\u00b0 7\u2032 and 71\u00b0 44\u2032 E., with an area of 678 square miles (1,760 km2) and contains the towns of Isakhel, Kammar Mushani and Kalabagh\n\n## Administration\n\n[edit]The tehsil of Isakhel is administratively subdivided into 3 Municipal Committees\n\n- MC Isakhel\n- MC Kamar Mushani\n- MC Kala Bagh\n\nand 13 Union Councils, these are:\n\n- Chapri\n- Khaglan Wala\n- Kaloaan Wala\n- Kallur Shareef\n- Kamar Mushani Pakka\n- Kot Chandna\n- Manda Khel\n- Sultan Khel\n- Tabisar\n- Tanikhel\n- Tola Bhangi Khel\n- Trag\n- Vanjari\n\n## History\n\n[edit]During British rule Isakhel became part of Mianwali District when the North-West Frontier Province was created in 1901.\n\nAccording to the 1901 census, it contained the municipalities of Isakhel (population, 7,630), the headquarters, and Kalabagh (5,824); and 43 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 1.6 lakhs. Lying on the west bank of the Indus, this tehsil is cut off from the rest of the District, and would seem to belong more properly to the North-West Frontier Province, but is separated even more completely from Bannu by the semicircular fringe of the Chichali and Maidani hills, which leave it open only\non the river side. These hills drain into Isakhel and make it fertile. Its extreme northern portion, known as the Bhangi Khel country, is a wild and rugged region, a continuation of the Khattak hills.[2]\n\nThe tehsil derives its name from the Isa Khel tribe, sub-tribe of the Niazi Afghans, who, settling here during the sixteenth century, long maintained their independence of the Mughal empire, and at last succumbed to the Nawab of Dera Ismail Khan.[2]\n\n## Demography\n\n[edit]The total population as of the 1998 census was 256,000. The main first languages are Punjabi (40%), Pashto (35%) and Saraiki (23%).[3]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**Tehsils & Unions in the District of Mianwali - Government of Pakistan Archived 2008-06-11 at the Wayback Machine- ^\n**a**Isa Khel Tahs\u012bl - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 13, p. 370.**b** **^***1998 District Census report of Mianwali*.

In appearance the tract bears a generic resemblance to the Dera Ismail Khan tahsil, except for the stony plain and the line of barren and unsightly hills which form its western border. The plain is much cleft by deep channels which carry off the rainwater from the hills, and these are utilized for irrigation with great skill. The population in 1901 was 55,053, compared with 52,270 in 1891. The headquarters are at Kulachi (population, 9,125), and the tehsil also contains 81 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 96,000.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"DISTRICT AND TEHSIL LEVEL POPULATION SUMMARY WITH REGION BREAKUP: KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA\" (PDF).

Khan** is a district in the Dera Ismail Khan division of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The capital of the district is the town of Dera Ismail Khan. The district has an area of 9,334 km2 (3,604 sq mi) and a population of 1,822,916 as of the 2023 Census.[3]\nAfter the Second Anglo-Sikh war in 1849 the district was annexed by\nthe British as part of the Punjab and remained so until 1901 when the North West Frontier Province or NWFP (now renamed as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) was created.\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]The district of Dera Ismail Khan is bounded on the North east by the Bhakkar and Dera Ghazi Khan districts of Punjab. Eastern portions of the district along the Indus river are characterized by fertile alluvial plains, while lands farther from the river consist of clay soil cut by ravines from rainfall. The district is bounded on the southwest by a thin strip of the South Waziristan district, which separates D.I Khan from the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain in the neighboring Baluchistan province. In the northwest is the Tank District.[4]\n\nD.I Khan is separated from the *Marwat* plains of the Lakki Marwat district by a spur of clay and sandstone hills that stretch east from the Sulaiman mountains to the Indus river known as the *Sheikh Badin* Hills.[ citation needed]\n\nThe highest peak in the range is the limestone Sheik Badin mountain, which is protected by the Sheikh Badin National Park. Near the Indus River is a spur of limestone hills known as the *Kafir Kot* hills, where the ancient Hindu complex of Kafir Kot is located.[4] DI Khan is also considered the center of Pakistan because of its location between Bhakkar, Mianwali of North Punjab, Zhob of Balochistan and South Waziristan of Pakistan's tribal belt.[ citation needed]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Etymology\n\n[edit]It is named after Dodai mercenary Ismail Khan, son of Malik Sohrab Dodai of the Langah Sultanate of Multan, who laid the foundation of the area.[5]\n\n### Ancient history\n\n[edit]The Dera Ismail Khan District is littered with ruins from ancient civilizations. Dera Ismail Khan is home to the collection of Hindu ruins from two separate sites 20 miles apart,[4] jointly known as Kafir Kot.\n\nThe region came under the influence of the Nanda empire of the ancient India from 300 BCE. With the rise of Chandragupta Maurya, the region came under the complete control of the Mauryan empire. Afterward, the region was briefly and nominally controlled by the Shunga empire. However, with the decline of the Shungas, the region passed to local Hindu and Buddhist rulers and was interrupted by foreign rulers. Many of these foreign rulers, like the Indo-Parthians, Sakas, and Kushans converted to Hinduism and Buddhism and promoted these Indian religions throughout central and south Asia.\n\nWith the decline of the imperial Guptas, the Hindu Shahis came to rule the area. The Hindu Shahis built two massive forts in the northern edges of Dera Ismail Khan. The forts were later renamed as \"Kafir kots\" (forts of the Kuffar (Disbelievers)). These Hindu Shahi forts were known for high towers and steep defensive walls. The Hindus also built many Hindu temples around the area. However, many of them are now in rubble. The Hindu Shahis remained in control of the area until their defeat by the Turkic Muslim army of Ghaznavids.[6]\n\nThe district is part of what was historically territory inhabited by the Baloch people during the medieval India, who were invited to settle in the region by Shah Husseyn of the Langah Sultanate of Multan. These Baloch settlers were displaced by or assimilated into later waves of the Pashtun settlement.[4]\n\n### British era\n\n[edit]Dera Ismail Khan district was annexed by the British from its former Sikh rulers after the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1848\u20131849.[7] Dera Ismail Khan was created as an administrative unit of the British India, part of the Derajat Division of the North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). It was formerly divided into almost two equal portions by the Indus river which intersected it from north to south. To the west of the Indus, the characteristics of the country resembled those of Dera Ghazi Khan. To the east of the present bed of the river, there is a wide track known as the Kachi, exposed to river action. Beyond this, the country rises abruptly, and a barren, almost desert plain stretches eastwards, sparsely cultivated, and inhabited by nomadic tribes.\n\nIn 1901, the trans-Indus tract was allotted to the newly formed North-West Frontier Province, the cis-Indus tract remaining in the Punjab jurisdiction. The cis-Indus portions of the Dera Ismail Khan and the Bannu districts now comprise the new Punjab district of Mianwali. Wheat and wool were exported. In 1901, it contained an area of 8,814 km2 (3,403 sq mi) and a population of 252,379. In 1947, it became part of the newly independent State of Pakistan.[8]\n\nIn 2016, 191,000 acres in the district were brought under cultivation with completion of the Gomal Zam dam, and a series of irrigation canals partially funded by the United States Government.[9]\n\n## Demography\n\n[edit]**Languages**\n\nSaraiki are main ethnic groups in Dera Ismail Khan District in simple majority.

(Wan Bhachran \u2014 Mianwali: source: Wan Bhachran \/ Mianwali pages.)\n\nStep 2 \u2014 the conqueror \/ founder and his ancestral naming conventions.  \n- The baoli\u2019s builder Sher Shah Suri was the founder of the Sur (Suri) dynasty. Pashtun tribal naming conventions use affiliation terms such as \u201ckhel\u201d (and \u201c-zai\u201d), and those \u201c-khel\u201d names appear among peoples living near the Indus (the Indus is also called Abasin). (Sher Shah Suri \/ Sur; Khel (clan); Indus = Abasin.)\n\nStep 3 \u2014 the waterway and the distinct river marking a southern territory.  \n- The Indus (Abasin) flows in the same general region where the Gomal River lies; the Gomal forms a boundary around South Waziristan.

(Gomal River \u2192 Kulachi Tehsil.)\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Kulachi (first tehsil) and the second similar subdivision.  \n- Kulachi was once an important\/principal tehsil of the old Dera Ismail Khan district. The Gomal then continues into Dera Ismail Khan Tehsil \u2014 a second tehsil whose principal town shares the tehsil\u2019s name (Dera Ismail Khan).

He was a United States senator from California and was the first Republican nominee for president of the U.S. in 1856 and founder of the California Republican Party upon being nominated. Fr\u00e9mont lost the election to Democrat James Buchanan.\n\nA native of Georgia, he attended the College of Charleston for two years until he was expelled after irregular attendance. In the 1840s, Fr\u00e9mont led five expeditions into the western states. During this time, he directed several massacres of the indigenous peoples in California as part of the California genocide. During the Mexican\u2013American War, he was a major in the United States Army and took control of a portion of California north of San Francisco from the short-lived California Republic in 1846. Fr\u00e9mont was court-martialed and convicted of mutiny and insubordination after a conflict over who was the rightful military governor of California. His sentence was commuted, and he was reinstated by President James K. Polk, but Fr\u00e9mont resigned from the Army. Afterwards, he settled in California at Monterey while buying cheap land in the Sierra foothills. Gold was found on his Mariposa ranch, and Fr\u00e9mont became a wealthy man during the California Gold Rush. He became one of the first two U.S. senators elected from the new state of California in 1850.\n\nAt the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, he was given command of the Department of the West by President Abraham Lincoln. Fr\u00e9mont had successes during his brief tenure there, though he ran his department autocratically and made hasty decisions without consulting President Lincoln or Army headquarters. He opposed slavery and issued an unauthorized emancipation edict, which led to him being relieved of his command for insubordination by Lincoln. After a brief service tenure in the Mountain Department in 1862, Fr\u00e9mont resided in New York, retiring from the army in 1864. He was nominated for president in 1864 by the Radical Democratic Party, a breakaway faction of abolitionist Republicans, but he withdrew before the election. After the Civil War, he lost much of his wealth in the unsuccessful Pacific Railroad in 1866, and he lost more in the Panic of 1873. Fr\u00e9mont served as Governor of the Arizona Territory from 1878 to 1881. After his resignation as governor, he retired from politics and died destitute in New York City in 1890.\n\nHistorians portray Fr\u00e9mont as controversial, impetuous, and contradictory. Some scholars regard him as a military hero of significant accomplishment, while others view him as a failure who repeatedly defeated his own best interests. The keys to Fr\u00e9mont's character and personality, several historians argue, lie in his having been born \"illegitimate\" (to unwed parents) and in his drive for success, need for self-justification, and passive-aggressive behavior.[1][2] His biographer Allan Nevins wrote that Fr\u00e9mont lived a dramatic life of remarkable successes and dismal failures.[3][4]\n\n## Early life, education, and early career\n\n[edit]John Charles Fr\u00e9mont was born on January 21, 1813, the son of Charles Fr\u00e9mon, a French-Canadian immigrant school-teacher,[5][6][a] and Anne Beverley Whiting, the youngest daughter of socially prominent Virginia planter Col. Thomas Whiting. At age 17, Anne married Major John Pryor, a wealthy Richmond resident in his early 60s. In 1810, Pryor hired Fr\u00e9mon to tutor his young wife Anne. Pryor confronted Anne when he found out she was having an affair with Fr\u00e9mon. Anne and Fr\u00e9mon fled to Williamsburg on July 10, 1811, later settling in Norfolk, Virginia, taking with them household slaves Anne had inherited.[9][7] The couple later settled in Savannah, Georgia, where she gave birth to their son Fr\u00e9mont out of wedlock.[5] Pryor published a divorce petition in the *Virginia Patriot* and charged that his wife had \"for some time past indulged in criminal intercourse\". When the Virginia House of Delegates refused the divorce petition, it was impossible for the couple to marry. In Savannah, Anne took in boarders while Fr\u00e9mon taught French and dancing. Their domestic slave, Black Hannah, helped raise young John.[7]\n\nOn December 8, 1818, Fr\u00e9mont's father died in Norfolk, Virginia, leaving Anne a widow to take care of John and several young children alone on a limited inherited income.[5] Anne and her family moved to Charleston, South Carolina. Fr\u00e9mont, knowing his origins and coming from relatively modest means, grew up a proud, reserved, restless loner who although self-disciplined, was ready to prove himself and unwilling to play by the rules.[10] The young Fr\u00e9mont was considered to be \"precocious, handsome, and daring,\" having the ability of obtaining protectors.[5] A lawyer, John W. Mitchell, provided for Fr\u00e9mont's early education whereupon Fr\u00e9mont in May 1829 entered Charleston College, teaching at intervals in the countryside, but was expelled for irregular attendance in 1831. Fr\u00e9mont, however, had been grounded in mathematics and natural sciences.[5]\n\nFr\u00e9mont attracted the attention of eminent South Carolina politician Joel R. Poinsett, an Andrew Jackson supporter, who secured Fr\u00e9mont an appointment as a teacher of mathematics aboard the sloop USS *Natchez*, sailing the South American seas in 1833.[11] Fr\u00e9mont resigned from the navy and was appointed second lieutenant in the U.S. Topographical Corps, surveying a route for the Charleston, Louisville, and Cincinnati railroad.[12][ verification needed] Working in the Carolina mountains, Fr\u00e9mont desired to become an explorer.\n\n[5]Between 1837 and 1838, Fr\u00e9mont's desire for exploration increased while in Georgia on reconnaissance to prepare for the removal of Cherokee Indians.\n\n[5]When Poinsett became Secretary of War, he arranged for Fr\u00e9mont to assist French explorer and scientist Joseph Nicollet in exploring the lands between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.\n\n[11]\n\n[Fr\u00e9mont became a first rate topographer, trained in astronomy, and geology, describing fauna, flora, soil, and water resources.\n\n*verification needed*][13]\n\n[Gaining valuable western frontier experience Fr\u00e9mont met Henry Sibley, Joseph Renville, J.B. Faribault, \u00c9tienne Provost, and the Sioux nation.\n\n*verification needed*][14]\n\n## Marriage and senatorial patronage\n\n[edit]Fr\u00e9mont's exploration work with Nicollet brought him in contact with Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, powerful chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs.[11] Benton invited Fr\u00e9mont to his Washington home where he met Benton's 16-year-old daughter Jessie Benton.[11] A romance blossomed between the two; however, Benton was initially against it because Fr\u00e9mont was not considered upper society.[11] In 1841, Fr\u00e9mont (age 28) and Jessie eloped and were married by a Catholic priest.[11][15] Initially Benton was furious at their marriage, but in time, because he loved his daughter, he accepted their marriage and became Fr\u00e9mont's patron.[11] Benton, Democratic Party leader for more than 30 years in the Senate, championed the expansionist movement, a political cause that became known as Manifest Destiny.[11] The expansionists believed that the North American continent, from one end to the other, north and south, east and west, should belong to the citizens of the U.S. They believed it was the nation's destiny to control the continent. This movement became a crusade for politicians such as Benton and his new son-in-law. Benton pushed appropriations through Congress for national surveys of the Oregon Trail, the Oregon Country, the Great Basin, and Sierra Nevada Mountains to California. Through his power and influence, Senator Benton obtained for Fr\u00e9mont the leadership, funding, and patronage of three expeditions.\n\n## Fr\u00e9mont's first three expeditions\n\n[edit]The opening of the American West began in 1804, when the Lewis and Clark Expedition (led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark) started exploration of the new Louisiana Purchase territory to find a northwest passage up the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. President Thomas Jefferson had envisioned a Western empire, and also sent the Pike Expedition under Zebulon Pike to explore the southwest.[16] American and European fur trappers, including Peter Skene Ogden and Jedediah Smith, explored much of the American West in the 1820s.[17][18][19][b] Fr\u00e9mont, who would later be known as *The Pathfinder*, carried on this tradition of Western overland exploration, building on and adding to the work of earlier pathfinders to expand knowledge of the American West.[20] Fr\u00e9mont's talent lay in his scientific documentation, publications, and maps made based on his expeditions, making the American West accessible for many Americans.[20] Beginning in 1842, Fr\u00e9mont led five western expeditions; however, between the third and fourth expeditions, Fr\u00e9mont's career took a fateful turn because of the Mexican\u2013American War. Fr\u00e9mont's initial explorations \u2013 specifically, his timely scientific reports (co-authored by his wife Jessie) and their romantic writing style \u2013 encouraged Americans to travel West.[21] A series of seven maps produced from his findings, published by the Senate in 1846, served as a guide for thousands of American emigrants, depicting the entire length of the Oregon Trail.[21]\n\n### First expedition (1842)\n\n[edit]When Nicollet was too ill to continue any further explorations, Fr\u00e9mont was chosen to be his successor.[14] His first important expedition was planned by Benton, Senator Lewis Linn, and other Westerners interested in acquiring the Oregon Territory.[14] The scientific expedition started in the summer of 1842 and was to explore the Wind River of the Rocky Mountains, examine the Oregon Trail through the South Pass, and report on the rivers and the fertility of the lands, find optimal sites for forts, and describe the mountains beyond in Wyoming.[14] By chance meeting, Fr\u00e9mont was able to gain the valuable assistance of mountain man and guide Kit Carson.[14] Fr\u00e9mont and his party of 25 men, including Carson, embarked from the Kansas River on June 15, 1842, following the Platte River to the South Pass, and starting from Green River he explored the Wind River Range.[14] Fr\u00e9mont climbed a 13,745-foot mountain (4,189 m), *Fr\u00e9mont's Peak*, planted an American flag, claiming the Rocky Mountains and the West for the United States.[14] On Fr\u00e9mont's return trip he and his party carelessly rafted the swollen Platte River losing much of his equipment.[14] His five-month exploration, however, was a success, returning to Washington in October.[14] Fr\u00e9mont and his wife Jessie wrote a *Report of the Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains* (1843), which was printed in newspapers across the country; the public embraced his vision of the west not as a place of danger but wide open and inviting lands to be settled.[22][14][c]\n\n### Second expedition (1843\u20131844)\n\n[edit]Fr\u00e9mont's successful first expedition led quickly to a second; it began in the summer of 1843.[14] The more ambitious goal this time was to map and describe the second half of the Oregon Trail, find an alternate route to the South Pass, and push westward toward the Pacific Ocean on the Columbia River in Oregon Country.[14] Fr\u00e9mont and his almost 40 well-equipped men left the Missouri River in May after he controversially obtained a 12-pound howitzer cannon in St. Louis.[14] Fr\u00e9mont invited Carson on the second expedition, due to his proven skills, and he joined Fr\u00e9mont's party on the Arkansas River.[14] Unable to find a new route through Colorado to the South Pass, Fr\u00e9mont took to the regular Oregon Trail, passing the main body of the great migration of 1843.[14] His party stopped to explore the northern part of the Great Salt Lake, then traveling by way of Fort Hall and Fort Boise to Marcus Whitman's mission on the Walla Walla River at the Columbia River in Oregon.[14] Fr\u00e9mont's endurance, energy, and resourcefulness over the long journey was remarkable.[14] Traveling west along the Columbia, they came within sight of the Cascade Range peaks and saw Mount St. Helens and Mount Hood. Reaching the Dalles on November 5, Fr\u00e9mont left his party and traveled to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company Fort Vancouver for supplies.[14]\n\nRather than turning around and heading back to St. Louis, Fr\u00e9mont resolved to explore the Great Basin between the Rockies and the Sierras and advance Benton's dream of acquiring the West for the United States.[23] Fr\u00e9mont and his party turned south along the eastern flank of the Cascades to Pyramid Lake, which he named.[23] Staying on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, they went on south as far as present-day Minden, Nevada, reaching the Carson River on January 18, 1844.[23] From there Fr\u00e9mont turned west into the cold and snowy Sierra Nevada, becoming one of the first Americans to see Lake Tahoe.[23] Carson successfully led Fr\u00e9mont's party through a new pass over the high Sierras, which Fr\u00e9mont named Carson Pass in his honor. Fr\u00e9mont and his party then descended the American River to Sutter's Fort (Spanish: Nueva Helvetia) at present-day Sacramento, California, in early March.[23] Captain John Sutter, a Swiss-Mexican (and later American by treaty) immigrant and founder of the fort, received Fr\u00e9mont gladly and refitted his expedition party.[23] While at Sutter's Fort, Fr\u00e9mont talked to American settlers, who were growing numerous, and found that Mexican authority over California was very weak.[23]\n\nLeaving Sutter's Fort, Fr\u00e9mont and his men headed south along the eastern edge of the San Joaquin Valley and crossed Tehachapi Pass and Antelope Valley, struck the Spanish Trail at present Victorville, California and then northeast through present-day Las Vegas, through Utah and back to South Pass.[23] Exploring the Great Basin, Fr\u00e9mont verified that all the land (centered on modern-day Nevada between Reno and Salt Lake City) was an endorheic, without any outlet rivers flowing towards the sea. The finding contributed greatly to a better understanding of North American geography, and disproved a longstanding legend of a \"Buenaventura River\" that flowed out the Great Basin across the Sierra Nevada. After exploring Utah Lake, Fr\u00e9mont traveled by way of the Pueblo until he reached Bent's Fort on the Arkansas River.[23] In August 1844, Fr\u00e9mont and his party finally arrived back in St. Louis, ending the journey that lasted over one year.[23] His wife Jessie and Fr\u00e9mont returned to Washington, where the two wrote a second report, scientific in detail, showing the Oregon Trail was not difficult to travel and that the Northwest had fertile land.[23] The Senate and House each ordered the printing of 10,000 copies to be distributed to the press and public, used to promote the cause of national expansion.[23][d]\n\n### Third expedition (1845)\n\n[edit]With the backdrop of an impending war with Mexico, after James K. Polk had been elected president, Benton quickly organized a third expedition for Fr\u00e9mont.[23] The plan for Fr\u00e9mont under the War Department was to survey the central Rockies, the Great Salt Lake region, and part of the Sierra Nevada.[23] Back in St. Louis, Fr\u00e9mont organized an armed surveying expedition of 60 men, with Carson as a guide, and two distinguished scouts, Joseph Walker and Alexis Godey.[23] Working with Benton and Secretary of Navy George Bancroft, Fr\u00e9mont was secretly told that if war started with Mexico he was to turn his scientific expedition into a military force.[23] President Polk, who had met with Fr\u00e9mont at a cabinet meeting, was set on taking California.[27] Fr\u00e9mont desired to conquer California for its beauty and wealth, and would later explain his very controversial conduct there.[23]\n\nOn June 1, 1845, Fr\u00e9mont and his armed expedition party left St. Louis having the immediate goal to locate the source of the Arkansas River, on the east side of the Rocky Mountains.[28][23] Fr\u00e9mont and his party struck west by way of Bent's Fort, The Great Salt Lake, and the \"Hastings Cut-Off\".[23] When Fr\u00e9mont reached the Ogden River, which he renamed the Humboldt, he divided his party in two to double his geographic information.[23] Upon reaching the Arkansas River, Fr\u00e9mont suddenly made a blazing trail through Nevada straight to California, having a rendezvous with his men from the split party at Walker Lake in west-central Nevada.[29][e]\n\n#### Attacks against Native Americans in California and Oregon Country (1845\u20131846)\n\n[edit]Taking 16 men, Fr\u00e9mont split his party again, arriving at Sutter's Fort in the Sacramento Valley on December 9.[29] Fr\u00e9mont promptly sought to stir up patriotic enthusiasm among the American settlers there. He promised that if war with Mexico started, his military force would protect the settlers.[31] Fr\u00e9mont went to Monterey, California, to talk with the American consul, Thomas O. Larkin, and Mexican *commandant* Jose Castro, under the pretext of gaining fuller supplies.[23] In February 1846, Fr\u00e9mont reunited with 45 men of his expedition party near Mission San Jos\u00e9, giving the United States a relatively strong military presence in California.[32] Castro and Mexican officials were suspicious of Fr\u00e9mont and he was ordered to leave the country.[33][23] Fr\u00e9mont and his men withdrew and camped near the summit of what is now named Fremont Peak. Fr\u00e9mont raised the United States Flag in defiance of Mexican authority.[23]\n\nAfter a four-day standoff and Castro having a superior number of Mexican troops, Fr\u00e9mont and his men went north to Oregon, bringing about the Sacramento River massacre along the way. Estimates of the casualties vary. Expedition members Thomas E. Breckenridge and Thomas S. Martin claim the number of Native Americans killed as \"120\u2013150\"[34] and \"over 175\"[35] respectively, but the eyewitness Tustin claimed that at least 600\u2013700 Native Americans were killed on land, with another 200 or more dying in the water.[36] There are no records of any expedition members being killed or wounded in the massacre.[37] Kit Carson, one of the mounted attackers, later stated, \"It was a perfect butchery.\"[38]\n\nFremont and his men eventually made their way to camp at Klamath Lake,[39][40][23] killing Native Americans on sight as they went.[41][42] On May 8, Fr\u00e9mont was overtaken by Lieutenant Archibald Gillespie from Washington, who gave him copies of dispatches he had previously given to Larkin.[23] Gillespie told Fr\u00e9mont secret instructions from Benton and Buchanan justifying aggressive action and that a declaration of war with Mexico was imminent.[23] On May 9\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Robert_F._Stockton\n# Robert F.

He was a naval innovator and an early advocate for a propeller-driven, steam-powered navy. Stockton was from a notable political family and also served as a U.S. senator from New Jersey.\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]Robert F. Stockton was born at Morven, Stockton Street, Princeton, New Jersey, into a political family; his father Richard Stockton was a U.S. senator and representative, and his grandfather, Judge Richard Stockton, was attorney general for New Jersey and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Robert F. Stockton was of English descent, and his family had been in what is now the United States since the early colonial period. On March 4, 1823, he married Harriet Maria Potter in Charleston, South Carolina. Ten children were born to this marriage.[1]\n\n### Early naval service\n\n[edit]Stockton was appointed a midshipman in the U.S. Navy in September 1811, shortly after his 16th birthday, and served at sea and ashore during the War of 1812. After that conflict, Lieutenant Stockton was assigned to ships operating in the Mediterranean, in the Caribbean and off the coast of West Africa. He was the first naval officer to act against the slave trade and captured several slave ships. In December 1821, while commanding USS *Alligator* along the African Windward Coast, Lt. Stockton, along with Dr. Eli Ayers of the American Colonization Society,[2] negotiated a treaty that led to the founding of the state of Liberia. One source said that Stockton \"leveled a pistol at King Peter's head and thereby convinced the latter to sell some of his territory\".[3] Another source states that, before Stockton leveled his pistol at King Peter, he handed another pistol to Ayers, directing him to shoot a mixed race slave trader who was warning King Peter that the Americans sought to end the slave trade from which King Peter's tribe profited.[4]\n\n### Business affairs\n\n[edit]During the later 1820s and into the 1830s, Stockton primarily devoted his attention to business affairs in New Jersey. In addition, Stockton owned and operated the Tellurium gold mine in Goochland and Fluvanna counties in Virginia. He had purchased it in 1848, after its discovery in 1832.[5] His son John P. Stockton was born during this period. He later followed his father into politics and was elected as a U.S. senator representing New Jersey.\n\nIn 1835, Stockton purchased a property in Monmouth County, New Jersey, called \"Sea Girt\".[6] The property was purchased in 1875 by a group of land developers, with the name of Stockton's estate ultimately leading to the choice of the name Sea Girt, New Jersey, when the borough was established in 1918.[7]\n\n### Resumes active naval service\n\n[edit]In 1838, Stockton resumed active naval service as a captain. He served in the European area but took leave in 1840 to undertake political work. Offered the post of U.S. Secretary of the Navy by President John Tyler in 1841, he declined the offer but worked successfully to gain support for the construction of an advanced steam warship with a battery of very heavy guns.\n\nThis ship became USS *Princeton*, the Navy's first screw-propelled steamer. The ship was designed by John Ericsson. Stockton commanded her when she was completed in 1843. The ship was armed with two long 225-pounder wrought iron guns, called the \"*Peacemaker*\" and the \"*Oregon*\". Although he was the deviser of the defective gun, Captain Stockton's political influence allowed him to be absolved of all responsibility for the February 1844 explosion of the gun, the *Peacemaker*, on board the ship. The explosion killed two cabinet secretaries and several others.[8]\n\nCleared by the court of any wrongdoing in the explosion incident, Stockton was sent by President James K. Polk to Texas. Stockton carried with him Polk's offer to annex Texas, sailing on the *Princeton* and arriving in Galveston. Stockton's observations while in Texas made him aware of the looming war with Mexico, a fact he communicated directly to Polk once he arrived back in Washington.[9] No vessel during the Mexican war was more useful than the *Princeton* in the Gulf of Mexico.[10][11] The records of the Navy Department showed she performed more service than all the rest of the Gulf squadron put together. [ citation needed]\n\n### Mexican\u2013American War\n\n[edit]**Conquest of California**\n\nOn July 23, 1846, Commodore Stockton arrived in Monterey, California, and took over command from the ailing Commodore John D. Sloat of the Pacific Squadron of U.S. naval forces in the Pacific Ocean.[12] Commodore Sloat had previously raised the US flag, without resistance, at Monterey, but had no plan to conduct any further military operations on shore and once relieved, sailed home to the United States, leaving Commodore Stockton in command of all US forces. Stockton's command ship was USS *Congress* and his combined fleet of three frigates with about 480 men each, one ship of the line with about 780 men and up to four sloops with about 200 men each as well as three storeships made him the strongest force in California as well as the senior military commander and military governor. He was the main driving force in continuing to take possession of Alta California.\n\nOn August 11, 1846, Commodore Stockton marched on Pueblo de Los Angeles to meet in battle with General Castro's army. Upon learning of the imminent arrival of Commodore Stockton, Castro retired, leaving behind all his artillery and made off in the direction of Sonora. Immediately after these events Stockton dispatched a courier, Kit Carson, to inform Washington of the proceedings and details of his conquest of California.\n\nOn December 6, 1846, Stockton learned that General Stephen Kearny had arrived in California with a small force and that he was besieged by vastly superior enemy forces at the Battle of San Pasqual. Kearny was among the wounded and in command of only 60 weary dragoons mounted on tired mules who were in a perilous position and under attack from a Californio-Mexican cavalry force under Andr\u00e9s Pico. However, for Commodore Stockton's immediate decision to take personal command of a relief column, the outcome could have been disastrous for Kearny.\n\nLater, the combined forces consolidated control over San Diego, and in January 1847 won the minor skirmishes at the Battle of Rio San Gabriel and Battle of La Mesa taking back control of Los Angeles. Faced with the approximate 200 men under John C. Fremont's California Battalion as well as Stockton and Kearny's troops, the Californios sued for peace and signed the Treaty of Cahuenga, which ending fighting in Alta California. Stockton, as senior military authority and military governor of the occupied territory, authorized John C. Fremont's appointment to succeed him as military governor and commander of the California Battalion militia force. When General Kearny finally arrived with orders to assume control of the temporary government Stockton turned over control to Kearny.\n\n### Political pursuits\n\n[edit]Stockton resigned from the Navy in May 1850 and returned to business and political pursuits. In 1851, he was elected as a Democrat from New Jersey to the United States Senate, where he sponsored a bill to abolish flogging as a Navy punishment. He resigned on January 10, 1853, to serve as president of the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, a position he held until 1866.\n\nHe was a delegate to the unsuccessful Peace Conference of 1861 that attempted to settle the secession crisis; instead the American Civil War began later that year. In 1863, he was appointed to command the New Jersey militia when the Confederate Army invaded Pennsylvania. Stockton died at Princeton, New Jersey, in October 1866, and is buried in the Princeton Cemetery.\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]Four U.S. Navy ships have been named USS *Stockton* in his honor. The cities of Stockton, California and Stockton, Missouri are named in his honor, as is the borough of Stockton, New Jersey, Stockton Street in San Francisco, and Fort Stockton, San Diego, California, which is now a ruin, but was occupied during the Mexican\u2013American War. In Mariposa County, California Stockton Creek is named after him due to a mine he owned in the California Gold Rush. In Liberia, Stockton Creek, a tidal channel that connects the Mesurado River and the Saint Paul River, and that separates Bushrod Island from the mainland in Monrovia, is also named for him.\n\nFormerly Commodore Stockton Elementary School in San Francisco between Clay and Pacific Streets was named after him. Stockton Street in San Jose was named after him and his Garden Alameda San Jose neighborhood. In Sacramento, Stockton Boulevard is the historic thoroughfare linking Sacramento and Stockton, now superseded by Highway 99 and Interstate 5.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^***A Sketch of the Life of Com.

A MIDSHIPMAN ON THE MAINE By Commander W. T. Cluverius, U. S. Navy FOREWORD This is a midshipman's story of the ill-fated Maine. It was written on the Santiago Blockade during the Spanish-American War and only a few months after the ship's destruction. His record has come to light from the bottom of a chest of old papers and he wrote as he felt, while the scenes were yet fresh in his mind's eye. The good ship and her stalwart crew have never been forgotten in the navy even though the twentieth anniversary of that dread night is now at hand. The North Atlantic fleet had arrived at anchor off Dry Tor- tugas on a delightful January evening, when the commanding officer of the battleship Maine received orders to proceed with his command to the city of Havana. At last, after a month of false alarms and tiresome lingerings in southern waters, an American warship was starting for Cuba. Some of us aboard considered it our good fortune, and others, while glad of the change, felt many misgivings within. We had been waiting since October, when, with hurry-up orders, we were sent to Port Royal, in South Carolina; then, after six weeks, a change of orders took us to the Norfolk Yard for Thanksgiving ; and, finally, we hastened to Key West, there to remain until the fleet came South, whiling away the time in pursuit of filibusters and mosquitoes \u2014 both giving us much trouble. Howbeit, January 25 dawned \" clear and pleasant,\" and on the starboard bow stretched the deep blue line of the Cuban coast. 238 A Midshipman on the \" Maine \" Steaming very slowly, every preparation was made for any possi- ble emergency. The question was : Had or had not the consul- general asked for a warship ? The main and secondary batteries were supplied with ammuni- tion, the guns themselves carefully examined and put in the best shape ; rifles were brought from the armory, rifle belts filled with cartridges ; the necessaries for a landing force gotten in readiness. When still well outside the Morro, we went to general quarters. American vessels were not usually taken unawares. We approached from the westward, the pilot boarded us, and slowly the good ship Maine entered the narrow channel \u2014 the first naval vessel to do so since the outbreak of the prevailing struggle for Cuban freedom. On the starboard hand, La Punta battery displayed its antique artillery, and beyond towered the Castillo de Principe. On the port hand was the Morro, imposing in its ancientness, built up from the jagged rock on whose extremity stands the lighthouse which marks the entrance. Far up on the battlements floated the yellow and red of Spain. On past the Morro, along the heights, stood the fortress of Cabanas, the lodgment of those Americans who had persisted in the art of filibustering and whose efforts had not met with success at Spanish hands. Just below Cabanas, on the hillside, was the laurel grove where doomed insurgents were shot ; and further down, on the water's edge, was the town of the Casa Blanca, where colliers were being unloaded from piers. Passing by the large German frigate Gneisenau, lying at anchor, the Maine arrived, without event, at the mooring buoy designated by the captain of the port. This was a government buoy \u2014 No. 3 \u2014 placed just off the Machina de San Ferdinand, the naval station. At another one of the buoys, the next to the northward, lay the Alfonso XII , a cruiser, the flagship of Rear Admiral Manterola. At 10, the port was saluted and Cabanas returned the salute. Then we saluted the Spanish admiral and the Alfonso answered. A boarding officer shortly afterwards made the usual visit to us. Crowds of people lined the wharves along the entire city front, house tops were full, and the boatmen were doing the best business of the season. Spaniards and Cubans are not naturally quiet, and the noise of the jabbering \u2014 the term seems justifiable \u2014 was plainly heard on our quarter-deck. The harbor was crowded with vessels. Across the way, off Regla, were the liners taking cargo from lighters ; up A Midshipman on the \"Maine\" 239 the harbor a bit were two or three small gunboats. Near Casa Blanca was moored the large dry-dock brought from England. At the docks were the transports loading with troops for other points on the island. No doubt the coming\" of the Maine had created a stir and set all the tongues of the populace going. \" So that's the best ship in the Yankee navy ! \" said one sneeringly. \" Why,\" remarked another of the loyal worthies on the docks, \" put her on the quarter-deck of the Carlos V and you couldn't find her.\" \" If the Palayo ever got after her! \" exclaimed a third. The Cubans, though, felt proud of the arrival of the Maine and took the meaning of it to themselves. An officer was sent to call on General Lee reporting the arrival and, also, that the salutes had been exchanged and the official visits made. I chanced to be the one sent to the consulate, and was put ashore at the Machina. At the gates to the street were throngs of people peering through at the American boat. Followed by a crowd of urchins and idlers I reached the Casa Nueva, in which are located both our own and the British consulates. The general received me and seemed much surprised at our early arrival. I could see that he did not expect a ship \u2014 at least, not just then. \"Was there any disturbance on your way in?\" he asked. \" None,\" said I. Again he looked surprised, and arranging the hour for Captain Sigsbee's visit I withdrew. With the same band of followers, augmented, perhaps, by a few more negroes, my cabriole soon reached the Machina where the boat awaited me. Not until after all the official visits were made, were the officers allowed to go ashore. Captain Sigsbee and his aid, Midshipman Holden, called on the admiral at his residence in the Machina ; then on the acting captain-general of the island, General Parrado. Blanco, at that time, was in the Province of Santa Clara attempt- ing to buy over the Cuban leaders in the east. General Parrado received the captain with much courtesy and promised to return the call next day. What with all these official obligations devolving upon Captain Sigsbee, it was some time before he found himself able to pay his respects to that august body of the Cuba-Espaiiola, the Autonomist Cabinet, whose dignity 240 A Midshipman on the \" Maine \" was considerably ruffled when the American naval officer failed to do homage the very first hour of his arrival! The second day in port, during the forenoon, General Lee \u2014 jovial as always \u2014 came on board with a party of Americans and Cubans, and a cordial greeting followed. The next day, General Parrado and staff arrived alongside in the official launch. They were received by the captain and officers, and the marine guard was paraded. General Lee accompanied the party, his civilian clothing forming a great contrast to the gaudy array of the Spanish staff-officers. Not one single uniform matched another. Some wore red coats, light blue trousers with green stripes ; some, blue coats, red trousers with black stripes ; others wore green coats, red trousers with blue stripes \u2014 for all the world like the \" soldiers-so-brave \" in the comic opera of the period. The acting captain-general, seemingly a very able man, inspected the ship from top to bottom. Some of his officers looked rather dubious, when, at the entrance of the long armor-passage, we desired them to pass through. There was no telling what those Americans would not do. Parrado was much pleased with the Maine and expressed his satisfaction the following day by presenting the officers' messes with the best sherry his cellars contained. Soon the visiting populace began to pour in upon us, from the early forenoon until dark every day. Large parties of Cubans \u2014 pretty girls, enthusiastic young men, scolding duennas, and cry- ing children \u2014 crowded aboard. And all the while Spanish boat- men, struggling for the gangway, made such a hubbub, that the sentry's order to \" move off \" or \" get out of that \" was not heeded. These fellows would hang on to the boats at the booms, to the pendants, to the ash-chute, to ring-bolts anywhere to be able to keep from pulling one whit more than absolutely necessary. The bluejackets enjoyed it all hugely, and, as only one or two spoke Spanish, those acting as guides used the sign language mingled with sea-going terms and strong English expressions. A party would gather around one as he opened the breech of a six-inch gun. He would go through the acts of loading, training, and aiming, then the meaning would dawn on the audience and a \" Si ! Si ! Si ! \" was passed around, and the entire party would put on a broad smile of admiration as the demonstrator took a fresh chew. A Midshipman on the \" Maine \" 241 No visitors were allowed below the main-deck unless accom- panied by one of the crew detailed by the officer of the deck. This rule was strictly enforced at all times. The chief master-at-arms, with his assistants and the marine sentries kept a constant patrol on the berth-deck and below. Now and then a Spanish officer was seen amongst the visitors, and sometimes a group of soldiers appeared ; but they, poor unfortunates, did not know a turret from a capstan. From time to time we saw the big transatlantic transports come in laden with raw troops, most of them mere boys. Then the city went wild, rockets fired, flags flying, ferry-boats leaving their route and circling around the steamers for hours, with brass bands hammering out \" Cadiz \" over and over, and the passen- gers yelling themselves hoarse with cries of \" Viva Cuba-Es- panola ! \u2014 Viva La Autonomiste ! \" Later on the troops would be removed, some sent to the front at once, some to Cabanas, and others to the arsenal up the harbor. Another German vessel arrived \u2014 the Charlotte \u2014 and anchored near by. Soon the French flagship Dubordieu came in and anchored near us, making a very pleasant neighbor. Shore leave was granted the officers a few days after our arrival and we were ordered to wear civilians' dress ashore at all times. Popular feeling, we soon found, was decidedly against us and against the maintenance of an American warship in the harbor of Havana. The Cubans, whose acquaintance we had made on board, extended hospitalities, and regretted very much their inability to entertain us as they wished, through fear of the annoyances and friction this would cause with the authorities. In other words, to be seen publicly with an officer of the American navy, meant to be marked as an insurgent sympathizer. Of course, we met many Cuban- Americans. The majority were delightful, polished persons. Others were American in name only, and had but little contact with our own people and our own customs. The greater bulk of the populace were Cubans. The Spanish troops \u2014 a very transient portion of the inhabitants \u2014 in and about the city were numbered by the thousands. There were officers everywhere. The cabmen, the boatmen, the public servants, the hotel em- ployees, and above all, the shopmen, were Spaniards. The Cubans we met were for the most part property owners, and, before the 242 A Midshipman on the \" Maine \" war, maintained their large sugar estates, so lived in a certain amount of luxury. The effects of the war on their interests were, first, to compel them to pay a heavier tax to the Spanish Govern- ment ; and, besides, to make a like compensation to the insurgents to be allowed to grind their own cane. Finally, the Cuban estates were closed entirely, many of them burned, so that the only planta- tions doing a profitable business in the Island of Cuba were those controlled by American interests. The representative Cubans \u2014 I mean those upon whom the duties of governing free Cuba ought by right devolve \u2014 directly and indirectly helped the insurgent cause. There were members of the best families in arms throughout the island. Yet, I have heard many Cubans say \u2014 seme of their best minds too \u2014 that annexation to the United States would be the only solution of the problem, the only means of securing the permanent welfare of the people at large. These, our friends, while they rejoiced to see the Maine at anchor off the city, often told us that they were not entirely at ease as regards our safety in those waters. Spanish treachery to them was an every-day affair. They saw it in the every act of the Spaniard, and naturally apprehensions for our well-being arose. The greatest element of disturbance in Havana society was the Spanish soldier. Should you chance to join that great throng of promenaders in the Parque Central, as the band played about the base of the statue of Isabella La Catolica, your first, thought would be \u2014 Where did all those Spanish officers come from? They outnumbered the civilians, and, in their comfortable colonial uniform, took possession of the promenade. One rarely saw a Cuban girl in these gatherings at that time. rfhe Spanish naval officer was more or less countenanced by the Cubans and was often received in their homes. Those I met were bright, courteous people. Yet even as the officers of the army were not obliged to remain with their troops in the various garrisons about the city, no more were the officers of the navy compelled to live altogether aboard ship. Their naval academy training profited them little, it seems, especially on the Cuban station. Drills and maneuvers were unknown; target practice, something they read of. Their vessels deteriorated because the funds for repairs never got as far as the ships themselves. In ****+.. the Alfonso XII, the flagship, had not been able to move A Midshipman on the \" Maine \" 243 under her own steam for one year before the Maine came, because almost every boiler-tube had gone \u2014 rusted and useless. Then the troops, a miserable lot of recruits they were, landed from a transport one day, sent to the front the next, marching- back and forth, through swamps and morasses, living in filth, one meal a day out of a common trough, fallen upon suddenly by insurgent bands, finally brought back, burning up with fever, to hospitals, which the majority of them never left again. And yet few deserted to the enemy. Unquestionably, the Spanish soldier who, fought the insurgents in Cuba deserves this much credit, that he remained loyal, despite unceasing cruelty and suffer- ing which few would have endured. There were several thousand volunteer troops in the city con- sisting of the shop-keepers, clerks, waiters, and loyal Cubans. Certain battalions were inspected each morning on the Prado. They carried their rifles as farmers would hay-rakes. An impos- ing spectacle they presented at dress-parade. The authorities had tried repeatedly to send them to the front. But they declared emphatically, one and all, that, primarily, they were the home guard. I noticed that their posts were principally in charge of the soup-houses for the rcconccntrados; so, no doubt, they had a strong political pull. The military police in the city were picked troops, and, as a rule, were very fair specimens of the soldier. There were also the civil police, with whom every cabman and street vender had the privilege of discussing any orders given them. In all, then, Havana was in a state of unquiet when the Maine arrived on the scene. The government was doing all it could to draw the minds of the people from the war. Mazzantini \u2014 the greatest living matador \u2014 was engaged for seven corridas at the Plaza de Toro, across the harbor in Regla. Tie was paid $30,000 for his endeavors to divert the distracted thoughts of the Havanese. Anonymous posters and incendiary circulars were scattered broadcast throughout the city. Some said the Autono- mists were responsible for them. Several reached the Maine. One of them denounced the Yankee pigs in strongest terms ; another upbraided the loyal citizens for tolerating the presence of an American warship in their beloved waters \u2014 could this be called Spain with honor? The crowds returning on the ferry-boats from the bull fights would shout \" Viva Espana,\" as they passed the Maine. In fact, 244 A Midshipman on the \" Maine \" one brave boat load went so far as to cry out \" Down with the Americans ! \" The days went by rapidly. General Blanco returned to the city and Captain Sigsbee called \u2014 the call was not returned. We made excursions in and about the city, saw the troops coming and going, took bicycle tours through the suburban towns, down to Mariano Beach, out to the ball games at Vedado. Yet, we never felt exactly at home. At the hotels, the Spanish and French officers were always shown preference. Often the cabmen would refuse to accept an American \" fare.\" The French officers were tend\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_EFnOArTpw7t7tedrnay0l5V6\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Robert F.

It roughly parallels the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a popular area for boating and fishing, with a number of accesses to marinas and other attractions. After crossing the Central Valley, the highway ascends up the Sierra foothills. It passes through Ebbetts Pass and contains the **Ebbetts Pass Scenic Byway**, a National Scenic Byway.\n\n## Route description\n\n[edit]SR 4, begins in Hercules at San Pablo Avenue just to the west of Interstate 80 as part of **John Muir Parkway** (the actual parkway extends west of San Pablo Avenue as a city-maintained thoroughfare). SR 4 starts heading east as a divided four-lane freeway from its junction at Interstate 80, but then the route's eastbound lanes become an expressway for a short section in unincorporated Contra Costa County between Sycamore Avenue and Cummings Skyway.[3] After becoming a full freeway again, SR 4 runs through Martinez and past the John Muir National Historic Site and the historic Franklin Canyon Adobe. SR 4 then enters another unincorporated area of Contra Costa County where it intersects with Interstate 680 and becomes the **California Delta Highway**. SR 4 then runs east through Concord, Pittsburg, and Antioch. The Yellow Line of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system runs in the freeway's center median from the Port Chicago Highway interchange in Concord to just east of the Hillcrest Avenue interchange in Antioch, where that line currently ends at the Antioch station.[4] The freeway then turns southward at its intersection with SR 160, bypassing the Bay Area's rapidly growing and outermost eastern suburbs of Oakley and Brentwood. The freeway ends after the Balfour Road interchange,[5] becoming a conventional two-lane highway. SR 4 then passes the suburb of Discovery Bay before continuing east across Victoria Island.[6] From SR 160 to Marsh Creek Road, the highway is also known as the **John Marsh Heritage Highway**.\n\nSR 4 continues east to Stockton, where it briefly joins Interstate 5 and then enters a separate freeway (known locally as the Crosstown Freeway) routing almost directly through downtown Stockton. The route then runs concurrent with State Route 99 before running eastward into the Sierra through Angels Camp, one of the richest quartz mining sections of the Mother Lode and home of \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\", and Calaveras Big Trees State Park. The route runs through the 8,050 ft (2,450 m) Pacific Grade Summit on its way up to the 8,730 ft (2,660 m) Ebbetts Pass and ends at State Route 89 ten miles (16 km) west of Topaz Lake, on the California\u2013Nevada border. However, \"To SR 4\" signage continues along southbound SR 89 north to near its intersection with State Route 88 in Woodfords, including reassurance shields for both SR 89 and SR 4 on top of the mileage sign just south of town.[7] The portion from Arnold to its terminus is designated the **Ebbetts Pass Scenic Byway**, which is eventually one lane.\n\nThrough the mountains, SR 4 is not suitable for large trucks, buses, or RVs, as it becomes very steep and eventually single-track, with no center dividing line shortly after the Mount Reba Turnoff to Bear Valley Ski area, with tight switchbacks. Ebbetts Pass is not plowed for snow, and thus closes during the winter months, often from November through as late as May, blocking through traffic between the Mount Reba Turnoff and Markleeville.[8]\n\nSR 4 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System.[9] The segments of SR 4 between I-80 in Hercules and Balfour Road in Brentwood, and just west of Stockton to SR 49, are part of the National Highway System,[10] a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.[11] SR 4 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System;[12] however, it is only a scenic highway as designated by Caltrans from a point east of Arnold to SR 89,[13] meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.[14] SR 4 is also known as part of the **John Muir Parkway** from I-80 in Hercules to I-680 near Martinez, named for the environmentalist John Muir.[15] The stretch through Franklin Canyon was once known as \"Blood Alley\".[3]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]Although segments of Route 4 had been part of the state highway system since 1909, Route 4 was officially designated as such between US Route 40 (now Interstate 80) and State Route 99 in 1934. Prior to that date, the then-existing segment was officially known as the \"Borden Highway\", and the bridge over the San Joaquin River is still referred to as the \"Borden Highway Bridge\" in tidal tables. Construction of Route 4 did not finish until 1935, however.[2]\n\nThe portion of Route 4 from US Route 40 to State Route 24 was added to the highway system in 1933 as Legislative Route Number (LRN) 106. East of the concurrency with State Route 24 to State Route 49, Route 4 was designated as LRN 75 from 1931 to 1934. Finally, the segment from State Route 49 to State Route 89 was signed as LRN 24 from 1909 to 1934.[2]\n\nIn the 1970s, a significant portion of the Filipino American community of \"Little Manila\" in Stockton was demolished when the \"Crosstown Freeway\" was constructed,[16] displacing what was once the largest population of Filipinos outside of the Philippines.[17] The freeway, while not yet designated SR 4, was initially constructed from a long-term temporary west end at Fresno Avenue, past I-5, up to a temporary east end at Stanislaus Street, essentially becoming a \"freeway to nowhere.\" In 1993, construction of the Crosstown Freeway from Stanislaus Street to SR 99 was finally completed. It is officially the **Ort J. Lofthus Freeway** for which it is named after the local civic leader lobbied to get construction of the freeway finished.[18] SR 4, which originally was routed on Charter Way (now Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) and portions of Mariposa and Farmington Roads, transferred its designation onto the Crosstown between I-5 and SR 99. In December 2016, the Crosstown Freeway west of I-5 (though technically not part of SR 4) was extended to Navy Drive via a viaduct bypassing the Boggs Tract neighborhood in Stockton. The connection to Fresno Avenue was subsequently closed to traffic permanently. This was to alleviate heavy traffic to and from the Port of Stockton that plagued the Boggs Tract neighborhood for several decades.[19] Despite being in the planning books for decades, it is unclear if the Crosstown Freeway past Navy Drive will ever be extended to SR 4 west of Stockton.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2009, a road built by the State Route 4 Bypass Authority, named the State Route 4 Bypass, opened in three phases, bypassing Route 4 in Oakley and Brentwood to the south and west.[20][21] Many of the signs and local maps designated this extension as simply \"Bypass Road\". A section of Marsh Creek Road was widened to serve as the connection between the bypass built by the authority and the original Route 4 towards Stockton. In 2012, Caltrans handed over authority for State Route 4 in Oakley and Brentwood to the respective cities. In return, it gained control of the bypass and the upgraded section of Marsh Creek Road, which officially became State Route 4.[22]\n\nIn 2004, voters passed a half cent tax increase to fund widening from 4 to 8 lanes from Loveridge Road to SR 160. The project lasted from 2010 to 2016 through Pittsburg and Antioch, with the final configuration as three mixed use lanes and one High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction and auxiliary lanes between interchanges as far as the interchange with SR 160. The median accommodates the eBART extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system.[23] In early March 2016, reconfiguration of the interchange of SR 4 and SR 160 was officially opened, allowing westbound SR 4 traffic to access northbound SR 160 directly and southbound SR 160 to access eastbound SR 4.[24]\n\nFrom SR 160 to the Balfour Road interchange, it continues as a four-lane freeway. In 2011, Caltrans awarded $25 million toward upgrading the section from Lone Tree Way to Sand Creek Road to a full freeway and constructing an interchange at Sand Creek Road. Sand Creek interchange opened in 2015 and Balfour Road in 2018.[5][25] The portion from Balfour Road to Vasco Road is single-lane each way and has a signal-controlled grade crossing at Marsh Creek Road.\n\nThe freeway segment of SR 4 in Stockton is part of a proposed route to upgrade SR 99 into I-7 or I-9. Under one proposal, the new interstate would go along SR 99 from the split with I-5 at Wheeler Ridge north through Fresno to Stockton, where the proposed route would then turn west via the SR 4 freeway to a terminus at I-5.[26]\n\nIn 2016, Pittsburg moved to install surveillance cameras along their portion of the route, in response to a series of 20 freeway shootings in the area that had taken the lives of six people, and injured 11, in the past year.[27]\n\n## Major intersections\n\n[edit]Except where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage. R reflects a realignment in the route since then, M indicates a second realignment, L refers to an overlap due to a correction or change, and T indicates postmiles classified as temporary ( ).[28] Segments that remain unconstructed or have been relinquished to local control may be omitted.

The multiphase project will widen SR 4 by adding a third lane in each direction, beginning at Morello Avenue in Martinez and ending at the merge of SR 4 and SR 242.[a] It will also include replacing the 50-year-old Grayson Creek Bridge, which has outlived its serviceable life and does not meet current bridge safety codes. The project will impact about 4 miles (6.4 km) of SR 4. Although no schedule or end date has been announced, the officials said that the estimated cost is about $136 million (in 2018 dollars).[36]\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"January 1, 2006 California Log of Bridges on State Highways\".

One researcher involved had previously delved into the mathematical landscapes of quantum scattering across dimensions and explored indices tied to supersymmetry. Together with a colleague specializing in neural networks from the same institution, they shifted focus to densely connected systems of continuous-state units. Their investigation explored the intricate 'movements' and potential for unpredictable, non-repeating patterns arising when these units, linked by Hebbian principles, possess activation responses that deviate significantly from the standard smoothed threshold curve.

However, these networks can easily be modified to predict continuous properties from images, like age, size, or price.\nQ: Can a neural network be used for classification?\nA: You can use neural network classification to classify data into categories automatically. For example, if you had a database of images of pets, a neural network classification model could sort those images into pictures of dogs and cats.\nQ: Is a radial basis function neural network uses linear or logistic function as the activation function?\nA: In the field of mathematical modeling, a radial basis function network is an artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. The output of the network is a linear combination of radial basis functions of the inputs and neuron parameters.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_W9HZp6rU9inez2WsBYVLa4rA\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Physica A Hebbian continuous units nonmonotonic activation chaos Belgian 1990s 'Hebbian' 'non-monotonic' 'continuous' 'Physica A' 1995 1996 Belgium 'analogue units' 'chaos' 'dynamical' 'dense connectivity'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] FereydoWlt Fami Mohamed Daoui\nURL: http:\/\/ndl.ethernet.edu.et\/bitstream\/123456789\/18140\/1\/399.pdf\nhis work on many diverse branches of statistical physics.

It formulates the updating gradient of the connecting weight in artificial neural networks.\nQ: How is Hebbian learning used in AI?\nA: In AI, the basic principle of Hebbian learning means that when certain patterns or pathways are activated together repeatedly\u2014such as specific structures in brain scans\u2014the system learns to strengthen those associations.\nQ: Is Hebbian learning supervised or unsupervised?\nA: Hebbian learning is unsupervised. LMS learning is supervised. However, a form of LMS can be constructed to perform unsupervised learning and, as such, LMS can be used in a natural way to implement Hebbian learning. Combining the two paradigms creates a new unsupervised learning algorithm, Hebbian-LMS.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_EhPngJpaNbEEXgLctpD39gng\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"analogue units\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Hebbian\\\\\\\" neural 'Physica A' 'continuous-state' 'analogue units' 'Hebbian couplings' \\\\\\\"Physica\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"analogue units\" \"Hebbian\" neural 'Physica A' 'continuous-state' 'analogue units' 'Hebbian couplings' \"Physica\"","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_p0tuvpDw7IbbIWbdjw4FpYqe\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"non-monotonic\\\\\\\" transfer function Hebbian 'Physica A' neural network 'continuous' 'Hebbian' 'Physica' 1995 1996 'chaos' 'nonmonotonic'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: chaos in diluted networks with continuous neurons\nURL: https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/15673284\/CHAOS_IN_DILUTED_NETWORKS_WITH_CONTINUOUS_NEURONS\n... non- monotonic transfer function (i.e. the function that gives the state of the neuron as a function of the postsynaptic potential) have been presented [12\u201315].\n\n---\n\nResult 1: A differential Hebbian framework for biologically-plausible ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0893608022000727\nby S Verduzco-Flores \u00b7 2022 \u00b7 Cited by 7 \u2014 .

A noisy stimulus with periodic variance results in a mechanism for controlling chaos in neural systems with fixed synapses: a proper amount of external perturbation forces the system to behave periodically with the same period as the stimulus.\n\n## References (32)\n\n- For a recent review, see A.C.C.

High connectivity levels maintain chaotic behavior while adapting synapses can suppress it.\n\n## How does external noise affect the dynamics of neural networks?\n\nThe analysis reveals that periodically applied noisy external stimuli can stabilize chaotic dynamics and induce periodic behavior in neural networks. Specifically, varying the stimulus variance leads to transitions between chaotic and periodic states.\n\n## What role do mean-field equations play in understanding network dynamics?\n\nThe paper shows that mean-field equations effectively describe dynamics in large diluted networks, treating neuron and synapse states as independent stochastic variables. This approach reveals a rich spectrum of behaviors, including chaotic and periodic attractors.\n\n## What is the significance of nonmonotonic transfer functions in neural networks?\n\nNonmonotonic transfer functions contribute to the complexity of neural dynamics, capturing physiological behaviors like neuron fatigue. The study demonstrates these functions generate rich chaotic dynamics distinct from traditional monotonic models.\n\n## How does synaptic adaptability impact chaotic dynamics in neural networks?\n\nThe findings indicate that adapting synapses lead to the suppression of chaos in networks with low connectivity. In contrast, for high connectivity, the chaotic behavior persists across different synaptic adaptation scenarios.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_QRdyka0IGjfED0Bp4ehPgjqH\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"D Boll\\u00e9 B Vinck Physica A 223 293 1996 title 'Physica A' 223 (1996) 293 Boll\\u00e9 Vinck 'Hebbian' 'continuous' 'neurons' 'analogue'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] arXiv:cond-mat\/9801312v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 29 Jan 1998\nURL: https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/cond-mat\/9801312\nThe generalization properties of an attractive network of non monotonic neurons which infers concepts from samples are studied.

Such learning may occur at the neural level in terms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_vMEEj4yKNFN3IDUhevuP6cg8\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Physica A\\\\\\\" 223 (1996) 293 Boll\\u00e9 Vinck title 'Physica A 223' '293' Boll\\u00e9 Vinck 1996 Physica A 223 293 title\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Unsolved ...\nURL: https:\/\/apps.dtic.mil\/sti\/tr\/pdf\/ADA343666.pdf\nby CR Doering \u00b7 1997 \u00b7 Cited by 10 \u2014 Bolle and B.

Together with a colleague specializing in neural networks from the same institution, they shifted focus to densely connected systems of continuous-state units. Their investigation explored the intricate 'movements' and potential for unpredictable, non-repeating patterns arising when these units, linked by Hebbian principles, possess activation responses that deviate significantly from the standard smoothed threshold curve.

{"example_id":18,"prompt":[{"content":"Identify the precise title of a 2020 publication featured in an IET journal focused on power generation and distribution. This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk.

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties.

The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk.

This article presents the chemical modification of surfactin esterified with three different alcohols, and nine novel surfactin derivatives have been separated from products by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The novel derivatives, identified with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), are the mono-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester, mono-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester, mono-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C14 ester, *di*-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester, *di*-hexyl-surfactin ester C15, *di*-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin ester C14, *di*-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin ester C15, *di*-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester and, *di*-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester. The reaction conditions for esterification were optimized and the dependence of yields on different alcohols and catalysts were discussed. This study shows that esterification is one of the most efficient ways of chemical modification for surfactin and it can be used to prepare more derivatives to meet the needs of study in biological and interfacial activities.\n\n**Keywords:** Keywords: surfactin, esterification, derivatives, lipopeptide, carboxyl group\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nSurfactin produced by strains of *Bacillus subtilis* is one of the most popular lipopeptide and has been studied for tens of years. It is a potent clotting inhibitor and can reduce the surface tension of water to 27 from 72 mN\/m [1]. Surfactin is one of the cyclic lipopeptides lactonized by a heptapeptide and a \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acid. The typical heptapeptide is l-Glu-l-Leu-d-Leu-l-Val-l-Asp-d-Leu-l-Leu [2,3,4], although there exist some homologues differentiated in their peptide sequence, such as [Val7] surfactin, [Ile7] surfactin [5], [Ala4] surfactin [6], [Asp1, Glu5] surfactin [7]. The \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acids are *n*-, *iso*-, or *anteiso*-3-hydroxy fatty with 12\u201316 carbons [7,8,9]. The representative structure of surfactin is shown in Figure 1.\n\nMuch interest has been focused on the chemical modification of surfactin. At present, most reported modifications were concentrated on opening the lactone ring through hydrolysis, and on methylation of the peptide loop side chain. It was reported that the lactone ring could be opened by treatment with alkaline [10,11], the resulted linear surfactin lost 97% of the protoplast-bursting activity [10], had no significant hemolysis and the surface activity of it was reduced compared to the cyclic ones [12]. Considering about methylation, there are two possible approaches to get the methyl surfactin, chemical modification [2,4,13,14,15,16,17] and biosynthesis [18,19,20]. Because of the two carboxylic groups on side chains of the lactone ring, there would be different esterified derivatives. Surfactin-Glu-\u03b3-methyl ester had a higher surfactant power than that of the surfactin, and a much higher haemolytic activity, 12 \u03bcM instead of 200 \u03bcM for 100% haemolysis [14], but lower anti-tumoral effect [18]. When residues of both an aspartic acid and a glutamic acid in surfactin were methylated (dimethyl-surfactin), the oil displacement activity increased by 20% and the derivatives showed an increased acid tolerance [16], but showed no virus-inactivation capacity [21]. The amidated surfactin had very similar properties of dimethyl-surfactin [16]. There were also some articles about total chemical synthesis, either in the liquid phase [22] or solid phase system [12,23,24,25] to get cyclic or linear surfactin and their analogues with low yields.\n\nIt could be inferred from the previous study that the increase of the hydrophobic of the polar domain could improve the surface activity of surfactin, but hydrolysis of the lactone ring would decrease the surface activity. Esterification is one of the most efficient ways of chemical modification [26]. In this article, we studied on producing variety of esterified surfactin derivatives in different reaction systems. The new compounds would provide some novel ideas to carry out study on the structure and property relationship of surfactin.\n\n## 2. Results and Discussion\n\n### 2.1. Identification of Surfactin-(Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-Hexyl Ester\n\nThe product formed by the reaction of surfactin with *n*-hexyl alcohol was purified by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) and identified by FT-IR (Fourier Transform InfraRed Spectroscopy) and ESI-MS (Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry). Four fractions B1, B2, B3 and B4 were separated, as shown in Figure 2. The yields of B1, B2, B3 and B4 were 3.4%, 5.4%, 32.4% and 48.2%, respectively.\n\nFT-IR spectroscopy of B1\u2013B4 was described in Figure 3. The FT-IR spectroscopy for purified compounds showed strong absorbance from 3500 to 3200 cm\u22121 with the maximum at 3303, 3304, 3305 and 3309 cm\u22121 for B1, B2, B3 and B4, respectively, which implies a typical feature stretching of N\u2013H in the peptide. The maximum absorbance around 1650 cm\u22121 belonged to C=O stretching vibration of the amide I region. The interaction of C\u2013N stretching mode of C\u2013N\u2013H group and N\u2013H bending vibration contributed to the absorbance around 1550 cm\u22121. The absorbance between 3000 and 2800 cm\u22121 was the evidence of aliphatic chain. The absorbance among 1800\u20131700 cm\u22121 was due to the C=O stretching mode of the lactone ring. Therefore, all these four fractions, B1, B2, B3 and B4 had the structure character of lipopeptide. C\u2013O\u2013C stretching mode located around 1190 and 1080 cm\u22121 region. Compared with that of the original surfactin-C14 and surfactin-C15, the absorbance intensity of B1\/B2 and B3\/B4 rose significantly in these two regions, which indicated the new ester bonds were introduced after this modification process. O\u2013H stretching had a broad absorbance from 3700\u20132200 cm\u22121, and the new compounds had narrow absorbance in this area revealed the reduction of carboxylic acid group. The FT-IR spectroscopy indicated that B1, B2, B3 and B4 were esterified surfactin.\n\nThe ESI-MS spectra of B1, B2, B3 and B4 showed the ionized molecular *m*\/*z* in Figure 4. For B1, the major *m*\/*z* peak was 1107, while *m*\/*z* peak at 1129 could also be found in the same mass spectrum. The difference between the two values was 22. Considering the common positive ionization mode: [M + H]+, [M + Na]+ and [M + K]+, the modes for B1 were [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+. The molecular weight of B1 was 1106, which was equaled to molecular weight calculation value of [Msurfactin-C14 + M n-hexylalcohol \u2212\n]. Combined with FT-IR results, B1 was mono-hexyl-surfactin-C14, which derived from surfactin-C14 with one of the carboxylic acid groups esterified by\n\n*n*-hexyl alcohol. The molecular weight of B2 was determined by the same way. B3 had the molecular weight of 1190, which equaled to the molecular weight calculation value of [M\n\nsurfactin-C14+ 2 \u00d7 M\n\n\u2212 2 \u00d7 ]. The molecular weight of B4 was equaled to molecular weight calculation value of [M\n\n*n*-hexylalcoholsurfactin-C15+ 2 \u00d7 M\n\n\u2212 2 \u00d7 ].\n\n*n*-hexylalcoholThe component identification results were listed in Table 1. B1 and B2 were mono-hexyl-surfactin ester, while B3 and B4 were *di*-hexyl-surfactin ester. The structures of B1, B2, B3 and B4 were described in Figure 5.\n\n#### Table 1.\n\n| Fraction |\nm\/z\n|\nIonization Mode | Molecular Weight | Compound |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| B1 | 1107 | [M + H]+\n|\n1106 | mono-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| 1129 | [M + Na]+\n|\n|||\n| B2 | 1121 | [M + H]+\n|\n1120 | mono-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester |\n| 1143 | [M + Na]+\n|\n|||\n| B3 | 1191 | [M + H]+\n|\n1190 |\ndi-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| 1213 | [M + Na]+\n|\n|||\n| B4 | 1205 | [M + H]+\n|\n1204 |\ndi-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester |\n| 1227 | [M + Na]+\n|\n\n### 2.2. Identification of (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-2-Methoxy-Ethyl-Surfactin Ester\n\nAnalytical and preparative HPLC were used to analyze and separate the product from the esterification and surfactin with 2-methoxyethanol. Three fractions, E1, E2 and E3, were purified from the product, as shown in Figure 6. The yields of E1, E2 and E3 were 1.3%, 11.0% and 16.9%, respectively.\n\nFT-IR contradiction between original surfactin and reaction products was described in Figure 7. E1, E2 and E3 showed a significant characteristic transmittance of lipopeptide at the certain wave number. For E1, E2 and E3, there was no strong absorbance around 2610 cm\u22121, which might relate to carboxylic acid dimmer of Glu and Asp. The absorbance in 1032 cm\u22121 implied the new ester bond was introduced, which implied that E1, E2 and E3 were surfactin esters.\n\nE1, E2 and E3 had quasi-molecular ion peak, *m*\/*z* at 1102.7, 1160.7 and 1174.7, respectively (Figure 8). The usual ionized mode in ESI-MS were [M + H]+, [M + Na]+ and [M + K]+. When the mode was assumed as [M + Na]+, the molecular weight of E1 was 1079.7, which equaled to the molecular weight calculation value of [Msurfactin-C14 + M2-methoxyethanol \u2212\n]. E1 was the surfactin C14 ester with one of the carboxylic acid groups esterified by 2-methoxyethanol, which could be named as mono-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C14 ester. The same analysis method was used to obtain the molecular weight of E2 and E3 (Table 2). Their structures were elaborated in Figure 9.\n\n#### Table 2.\n\n| Fraction |\nm\/z\n|\nIonization Mode | Molecular Weight | Compound |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| E1 | 1102 | [M + Na]+\n|\n1079 | mono-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| E2 | 1160 | [M + Na]+\n|\n1137 |\ndi-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| E3 | 1174 | [M + Na]+\n|\n1151 |\ndi-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin C15 ester |\n\n### 2.3. Identification of Surfactin-(Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-6-Hydoxyl-Hexyl Ester\n\nThe product obtained from reaction between surfactin and 1,6-hexanediol contained two major components, D1 and D2 (Figure 10). They were purified by semi-preparative HPLC under the above-mentioned condition. The yields of D1 and D2 were 33.8% and 53.1%, respectively.\n\nFT-IR spectroscopy of D1 and D2 were described in Figure 11. The FT-IR spectroscopy for purified compounds showed the maximum absorbance at 1654 and 1652 cm\u22121 belonging to C=O stretching vibration of the amide I region. And there was strong absorbance from 3500 to 3200 cm\u22121 with the maximum at 3309 and 3311 cm\u22121 for D1 and D2, respectively, which was a typical feature stretching of N\u2013H in the peptide. The absorbance at 1537 and 1538 cm\u22121 was due to the interaction of C\u2013N stretching mode of C\u2013N\u2013H group and N\u2013H bending vibration. The absorbance between 3000 and 2800 cm\u22121 was the evidence of aliphatic chain. The absorbance around 1730 cm\u22121 was due to the C=O stretching mode of the lactone ring. Therefore, it could be confirmed that D1 and D2 had the structure character of lipopeptide. Compared with that of the original surfactin-C14 and surfactin-C15, the absorbance intensity rose significantly at 1054 cm\u22121 for D1 and at 1058 cm\u22121 for D2. Those two regions related to C\u2013O\u2013C stretching mode, which proved new ester bonds were introduced. From 3700 to 2200 cm\u22121, the broad absorbance of O\u2013H stretching still remained for D1 and D2, but more narrow compared with that of original surfactin. The new absorbance of 987 cm\u22121 represents the interaction between (O\u2013H) bending vibration and (C=O) stretching. So hydroxyl group existed in both D1 and D2. It could be indicated that D1 and D2 were esterified surfactin with hydroxyl group.\n\nESI-MS of D1 and D2 was shown in Figure 12. The molecular weight of D1 was revealed to be 1222, for [M + H]+ ion at *m*\/*z* 1223 and [M + Na]+ ion at *m*\/*z* 1245 accordingly, which equaled to molecular weight calculation value of [Msurfactin-C14 + 2 \u00d7 M1,6-hexanediol \u2013 2 \u00d7\n]. D1 was *di*-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin ester C14. Component identification results were listed in Table 3. Both D1 and D2 were *di*-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin ester, which structures were described in Figure 13.\n\n#### Table 3.\n\n| Fraction | m\/z |\nIonization Mode | Molecular Weight | Compound |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| D1 | 1223 | [M + H]+\n|\n1222 |\ndi-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin C14 ester |\n| 1245 | [M + Na]+\n|\n|||\n| D2 | 1237 | [M + H]+\n|\n1236 |\ndi-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin C15 ester |\n| 1259 | [M + Na]+\n|\n\n### 2.4. Discussion\n\nThe typical surfactins are the two homological compounds, C14 and C15, and the difference between them is the length of the hydrophobic chain. New compounds B1, B3 and D1 were derived from surfactin-C14, while B2, B4 and D2 from surfactin-C15. HPLC chromatogram pattern had highly similarity between the original surfactins and the esterified ones. In the original surfactin, component ratio of C14 and C15 was approximately 1:1.57, while the yield one of (B1 + B3): (B2 + B4) equaled to 1: 1.50, E2:E3 equaled to 1:1.54 and D1:D2 equaled to 1:1.57. It implies that the individual derivative yields of C14 and C15 were directly related to the ratio of each component in the original surfactin.\n\nSince there are two carboxyl groups in the peptide moiety of surfactin, their chemically modified products exhibit two classes of forms. One is either Asp-\u03b2- or Glu-\u03b3-carboxyl group esterified by alcohol (monoester-SF), B1, B3 and E1, while the other is both of the two carboxyl groups esterified (diester-SF), B2, B4, E2, E3, D1 and D2. Owing to the composition of the surfactin and esterification mode, modified compounds were diverse in form. The structural diversity of the surfactin derivatives indicates their difference in properties.\n\nWe had tried to use concentrated HCl to catalyze the reaction of surfactin with 2-methyethanol and 1,6-hexanediol, but the results were not satisfied as there was almost 60% original surfactin still remained in the reaction solvent after stirred for over 4 days. It is probably because of the existence of two hydroxyl groups or polyoxyethylene group in the same molecule reduced the individual hydroxyl group electron density, and therefore decreased the reactivity of 2-methyethanol and 1,6-hexanediol. DCC\/DMAP [27] and EDC\/DMAP [28] were common catalysts for esterification, but based on current references, these two catalysts had not been applied to surfactin esterification. It was found that the product from DCC\/DMAP catalysis contained some byproducts, which is because of the 1,3-rearrangement of intermediate *O*-acylisoura leading to the forming of *N*-acylura that could not react with alcohol. The yield of byproducts was above 30%. While after reacted in the EDC\/DMAP system for 24 h, surfactin was completely transferred into ester. Based on current work, the merit of EDC\/DMAP catalyzing esterification method was fast and complete.\n\nFor HCl catalysis system, it was found that the ratios of monoester-SF and diester-SF in the products varied with the concentration of HCl and the reaction time. Three kinds of *n*-alcohol were selected to study the relationship between reaction condition and moiety type. Four conditions had been adopted to find regular pattern of the yield, condition 1 (C.1: catalyzed by 1 mol\/L HCl; reacted for 24 h), condition 2 (C.2: catalyzed by 1 mol\/L HCl; reacted for 48 h), condition 3 (C.3: catalyzed by concentrated HCl; reacted for 24 h) and condition 4 (C.4: catalyzed by concentrated HCl; reacted for 48 h). The ratios of monoester-SF and diester-SF in these four reaction conditions were plotted in Figure 14. The ratio for monoester-SF in the products was C.1 > C.2 > C.3 > C.4, while the ratio order was on the contrary for diester-SF. When the reaction was carried out in the 1 mol\/L HCl, it was more inclined to create monoester-SF. For diester-SF concentrated HCl was preferred. Prolonging reaction time from 24 to 48 h was advantageous for the production of diester-SF, but disadvantageous for monoester-SF, which was consistent with Thimon\u2019s report [14]. The results indicated that it was possible to regulate the ratio of surfactin monoester and diester, as well as to obtain specific derivative.\n\nCompared with the original surfactin, the retention time of those new compounds on the reverse phase column was elongated, which suggested the improvement of the hydrophobic property of them. Furthermore, in our experiment condition, B4 and D2 had nano pore phenomenon with the artificial bilayer membrane with only one side addition of them to the membrane, while original surfactin should be added on both sides to show such phenomenon [29]. This related to the importance of hydrophobic interaction in molecular penetration capability [11].\n\nThe calcium tolerance ability and the oil displacement activity [16] were improved through the modifications since Glu and Asp are negative charged amino acid residues in alkaline solutions and easily chelated with calcium [30].\n\n## 3. Experimental Section\n\n### 3.1. Reagents\n\nThe surfactin sample we used was obtained from the cell-free broth of *Bacillus subtilis* HSO 121 in our lab. The *n*-hexyl-alcohol, *n*-butyl-alcohol, *n*-amyl-alcohol, 2-methoxyethanol, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) were purchased from Aladdin-reagent Incorporation (Shanghai, China). The 1,6-hexanediol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\n### 3.2. Preparation of (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-Hexyl-Surfactin Ester\n\nFifty milligrams of surfactin was dissolved in 75 mL *n*-hexyl alcohol. Being added with 0.5 mL concentrated HCl, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 48 h and then successively washed by 0.5 mL redistilled water for three times to remove HCl, and dried with Na2SO4. After removing the residual alcohol under vacuum, the (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-hexyl-surfactin ester was prepared and applied to the analytical HPLC to monitor the components of the product. The purification was performed by RP-semi-preparative HPLC. The molecular weight and functional groups of product were detected by ESI-MS and FT-IR, respectively.\n\n### 3.3. Preparation of (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-2-Methoxy-Ethyl-Surfactin Ester\n\nOne hundred milligrams of surfactin was dissolved in 100 mL chloroform and added with 50 mg DCC\/5 mg DMAP and 3 mL 2-methoxyethanol in the ice-water bath. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then washed orderly by 100 mL fresh 1% citric acid solution, 100 mL 1% sodium bicarbonate solution, 100 mL redistilled water, 100 mL saturated salt water and 100 mL redistilled water, and retention organic phase was dried with Na2SO4. The organic solvent was filtered with 0.22 \u03bcm filter membrane before the chloroform removed under vacuum. After (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin ester was prepared, reverse phase HPLC was used to analyze the components of this product. Then the purification was achieved by RP-semi-preparative HPLC. The molecular weight and functional groups of product were separately detected by ESI-MS and FT-IR.\n\n### 3.4. Preparation of (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-6-Hydoxyl-Hexyl-Surfactin Ester\n\nOne gram of surfactin was dissolved in 100 mL chloroform and added with 0.45 g EDC\/0.29 g DMAP and 4.7 g 1,6-hexanediol in the ice-water bath, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then washed orderly by 100 mL fresh 1% citric acid solution, 100 mL 1% sodium bicarbonate solution, 100 mL redistilled water, 100 mL saturated salt solution and 100 mL redistilled water, and retained organic phase was dried with Na2SO4. After removing the chloroform under vacuum, (Glu-\u03b3, Asp-\u03b2)-6-hydoxyl-hexyl-surfactin ester was prepared. Analytical HPLC was used to monitor the components of this product. And the purification was achieved by semi-preparative HPLC. ESI-MS and FT-IR could be used for the product molecular weight and functional group detection.\n\n### 3.5.

The principal urban center of this newly formed dominion, an ancient port, is noted to have developed as an outpost concurrently with a neighboring settlement, both under the authority of an earlier, formidable medieval empire. This neighboring settlement, also originating in that historical period, was another territory controlled by this extensive empire, which was distinguished by its management of vital watercourses and its far-reaching trade networks before its power waned, enabling one of its own military commanders to rise to prominence. This commander, having previously served the declining empire, successfully broke away to institute his own dynastic sovereignty.

Clan families are patrilineal and are divided into clans, primary lineages or subclans, and dia-paying kinship groups. The clan symbolise the utmost kinship level. It possesses territorial properties and is commonly governed by a Sultan. Primary lineages are directly derived from the clans, and are exogamous political entities with no officially appointed leader. They constitute the division level that an individual typically indicates he or she is affiliated with, with the founding forefather reckoned to between six and ten generations.[8][5][9]\n\nThe Somali people are mainly divided among five patrilineal clans, the Hawiye, Darod, Rahanweyn, Dir, and Isaaq.[10] The average person is able to trace his\/her ancestry generations back. Somali clans in contemporary times have an established official structure in the country's political system, acknowledged by a mathematical formula for equitably distributing seats between the clans in the Federal Parliament of Somalia.[11][12][13]\n\nSomali clans were founded by various patriarchs who came to Africa following the emergence of Islam, and they are linked to the propagation of the religion in the Somali Peninsula. The traditions of descent from noble forefathers from Quraysh set the Somalis further apart from other neighbouring ethnic groups.[14][15][16][17]\n\n## Structure\n\n[edit]Somalis historically inhabit a region that extends from the Indian Ocean to the elevated terrains of eastern Ethiopia, and from the Gulf of Aden to the northern regions of Kenya. They represent the most extensive demographic within the Horn of Africa.[18]\n\nFrom an ethnological perspective, Somalis are classified as living in a segmentary society. This classification indicates that they are subdivided into numerous segments or lineages predicated upon genealogical proximity to a shared ancestor. Layered in all aspects of life, the clan is both a tool for identification and a way of life. Clans define in practice the relationships between all people and actors in Somalia.[19][20]\n\nThe principal organising tenet of the Somali clan system is the concept of patrilineal descent, referred to locally as 'Abtirsi' (lit. 'the counting of fathers'), derived from the Afroasiatic cognate for father, Ab[21] and *Tirsi*, a Somali term for 'the counting of'.[22][23][24] This notion encapsulates a minimal yet collectively recognised framework for understanding the structure and the hierarchy of genealogical relationships among the Somalis, ranging from the four primary clan families to their respective sub-lineages, which represent the most basic acknowledged units.[25][24]\n\n\u201cIt will now be clear that a Somali genealogy is not only a family tree conserving the historical origins of a group. In the sphere of politics, its significance lies in the fact that it represents the political affiliations of individuals and groups. By reference to his ancestors, a man\u2019s relations with others are defined \u2014 or at least circumscribed.\u201d\n\n[26]\n\nThe Somali concept of \u2018Abtirsi\u2019 refers to a systematically organized lineage-based registry or list of paternal ancestors among Somalis.[28][29] This lineage starts with the individual\u2019s father and extends to include the grandfather, great-grandfather, and so forth, ultimately culminating at the patriarch of the broader clan-family from which the individual is descended.[30] Although it is feasible to trace lineage beyond this juncture, the patriarch of the clan family, typically an Islamic sheikh denoting the importance of Islam, usually represents the terminus of such genealogical lines. Occasionally, this genealogy may also incorporate 'uterine' connections, which are grouped descendants of the male progenitor through a female spouse, thereby indicating the alliances formed by the descendants of that male ancestor by virtue of a shared mother.[31]\n\nThe Somali clan system is structured hierarchically, with five primary tiers of divisions (tol) identified, commencing from the top: the clan-family; the clans; the sub-clans; the lineages; and the sub-lineages or dia-paying groups.[32] Within the latter category, additional levels may be delineated. Over time, the parameters of inclusion undergo alterations, whereby sub-lineages may evolve into lineages. This is attributable to the fluctuations in the growth and decline of lineages and clans. As time progresses and demographic changes transpire, new units may emerge (diverge) from pre-existing ones, while earlier entities are condensed, a process that involves concentrating attention exclusively on prominent individuals within one's genealogical framework often referred to as 'Telescoping'.[33]\n\n\"The idea that the relationships must be there if only one can establish them is very powerful. It has the compelling force that great simplifying ideas have: it is so logical that it must be true\" (Virginia Luling; 2006: 474)\n\n\u2014 Virginia Luling\n\n\nThe terms 'clan-family', 'clan', 'sub-clan', or 'lineage' lack universally recognized equivalents in the Somali language. They are predominantly 'emic' formal designations. Consequently, this may give rise to a growing degree of ambiguity regarding the intermediate segmentation for external observers. Among Somalis, the term for clan is frequently denoted by the Arabic word 'Qabiil'. Thus, some individuals may perceive the endeavor of constructing a comprehensive Somali genealogy as misdirected or fruitless. Conversely, others may find themselves motivated to contemplate the intricacies of clan-line classification or to investigate historical and contemporary relationships among clans, clan names, and their intermingling and amalgamation as influenced by historical and socio-political dynamics.[33]\n\n\"Somalis themselves are very much busy with this idea and cherish it as a cultural ideology.\"\n\n[33]\n\nThe clan represents the highest degree of familial affiliation. It holds territorial properties and is typically overseen by a Sultan. Clans possess ancestral lands, which are associated with the migratory patterns of the Somali populace throughout their historical narrative. Each clan is administered by its designated leader and supported by its council of elders, with land being communally owned and overseen.[34] Various Somali clans utilise distinct titles for their leaders, including Sultan, Emir, Imam,[35] Ughaz,[36] and Garad.[37] Clan leadership may be hereditary, or leaders may be elected by the council of elders composed of representatives from diverse clan lineages. The leaders of these clans fulfill both religious and political responsibilities.[34] Although a historically ingrained socio-cognitive 'schema' exists among many Somalis concerning lineage, which delineates the various clan groups and 'tribes' that occupied specific territories and held (historical) claims therein, constructing an accurate genealogical tree would be unfeasible due to several factors, including the aforementioned 'telescoping.'[33]\n\nSomalis maintain a traditional attachment to territories where their kin are presumed to be more populous. To this day, the majority of Somalis still depend on patrilineal clan relatives for assistance and identification.[19] The degree of assistance rendered by one's clan is contingent upon the level of segmentation. At the more advanced levels of segmentation, particularly at the clan-family tier, there is no longer a guarantee of cohesion or collective action in particular instances.[33] In contemporary Somalia, the clan system exists in tandem with modern forms of societal and political organization. The reconfiguration and reassignment of responsibilities from traditional leaders to the judiciary, such as customary norms and laws, have altered the status and role of leaders within their communities.[34] The Somali clan system is often referred to as an obstacle to the state building efforts in Somalia.[11] The reasoning is aptly captured in this famous Somali proverb:\n\n\"Me and my clan against the world; Me and my family against my clan; Me and my brother against my family; Me against my brother.\"\n\n[38]\n\nCertain clans are traditionally classified as noble,referring to their pastoralist way of life, which contrasts with the more sedentary, agro-pastoral communities referred to as *Sab*. The principal noble clans include the Dir, Darod, Hawiye, and Isaaq.[39][40] Among these, the Dir and Hawiye trace their agnatic paternal lineage to Samaale, the likely source of the ethnonym *Somali,* Hawiye descending from Ahmed Bin Abdulrahman Bin Uthman.[41] In contrast, the Darod and Isaaq have separate agnatic traditions of descent from Abdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti and Ishaaq bin Ahmed respectively.[42]\n\nAccording to oral tradition, Sheikh Darod and Sheikh Ishaaq are asserted to have married women from the Dir clan, thus establishing matrilateral ties with the Samaale main stem.[43] The term *Sab* refers to agricultural clans such as the Rahanweyn, in contrast to Samaale.[44] Both Samaale and Sab are the children of the father \"Hiil\" who is the common ancestor of all Somali clans.[45][46]\n\n## Kinship\n\n[edit]The traditional political unit among the Somali people has been kinships.[2] Dia-paying groups are groupings of a few small lineages, each consisting of a few hundred to a few thousand members. They trace their foundation to between four and eight generations. Members are socially contracted to support each other in jural and political duties, including paying or receiving dia or blood compensation (*mag* in Somali).[47][48] Compensation is obligatory in regards to actions committed by or against a dia-paying group, including blood-compensation in the event of damage, injury or death.[2][49][50]\n\n## Social stratification\n\n[edit]Traditional Somali society, like that of other ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa and the wider region, has long exhibited a system of social stratification..[51][52][53] Historian Donald Levine identifies this structure as comprising high-ranking clans, low-ranking clans, caste groups, and slaves.[54] This rigid hierarchy and concepts of lineal purity contrast with the relative egalitarianism in clan leadership and political control.[52]\n\nNoble clans, the Samaale, constituted the upper tier and were known as *bilis*. The lower tier are the *Sab*, and are distinguished by their heterogeneous constitution and agropastoral lifestyle as well as some linguistic and cultural differences. The primary distinction between the noble clans and the *Sab* lies in their lineage structures. The Samaale clans are characterized by their linear purity, tracing descent through a single, unbroken paternal line to a common ancestor, which reinforces their cohesion and social prestige. In contrast to the *Sab who* constitute a confederation of multiple, often unrelated lineages brought together through alliance, shared lifestyle, or geographic proximity.[55][56]\n\nA third stratum within the Somali caste system consisted of artisanal groups, defined by their hereditary occupations and endogamy.[57] Among these groups, the *Midgan* traditionally served as hunters and performed circumcisions.[58][59] The *Tumal* (also spelled *Tomal*) were smiths and leatherworkers, and the Yibir (also spelled *Yebir*) were the tanners.[60][61]\n\nAnthropologist Virginia Luling notes that the northern artisanal caste groups shared the same ethnic origins as their higher-caste kinsmen, closely resembling them in appearance and generally exhibiting the same Caucasoid features typical of ethnic Somalis.[62] Despite this common ancestry and lack of ethnic distinction, noble clans have historically stigmatized these lower status groups, primarily due to their association with occupations considered socially degrading or ritually impure.[63]\n\nOutside the Somali caste system existed enslaved populations of Bantu origin, whose distinct physiognomy and occupational roles set them apart from ethnic Somalis and reinforced their marginal status within the social hierarchy.[64][65][66] Ethiopians, especially the Amhara and Tigrayan were also captured and sold to traders from Arabia, India, Greece, and beyond.[67] Oromo subjects were favored due to their features compared to other slaves.[68]\n\nTo satisfy the demands of the market for agricultural produce in the Arabian Peninsula and cater to the local needs, Somali clans in the Lower Shabelle region and along the ancient Banaadir coast began the procurement of Bantu slaves from Arab slave traders to provide labor and serve as client farmers for the Somali clans. The primarily Pastoralist clans surrounding the inter-riverine areas settled down not to farm, but to acquire slaves as agricultural laborers. With the growth of the plantation sector, pastoralists could convert part of their wealth in livestock to wealth in slaves, produce for a market, and earn a cash income to reinvest in the pastoral sector.[69]\n\n\"The farming was performed by local client-farmers, boon, or low status groups of the dominant Biimaal, Geledle, Hintirre, Murosade, Mobileyn and other predominantly pastoral clans which had established control of small portions of the valley. They produced mainly to serve local markets. Ample, fertile land remained uncultivated, due to a chronic shortage of farm labor. In order to respond to market demands for grain in South Arabia, the local Somali clans of the Lower Shabelle began purchasing slaves from Arab and Swahili slave ships. These slaves came first from Zanzibar (the Zegua or Mushunguli people).\"\n\n[70]\n\n## Law\n\n[edit]The customary justice system of Somalis, known as xeer, holds a significant position among the Somali clans, serving as a crucial mechanism for resolving conflicts. Somali clans are organized according to a patriarchal clan-based framework, which is further segmented into sub-clans, lineages, and mag groupings. These groupings are united through familial bonds or contractual agreements. Xeer justice primarily centers around the latter groupings, given their smaller size. Within these units, every member is held accountable for the actions of others and thus shares a portion of any imposed punishment. Under this system, only the victim or their immediate family has the authority to initiate criminal proceedings through xeer mediation. xeer relies on clan elders who utilize precedent, Sharia law, and mutual verbal agreements between clans to settle disputes and provide resolutions.[71][72]\n\n## Patronage system\n\n[edit]The Somali Abban system (lit. 'patron' or 'protector') is a system in Somali society that structured cross clan interactions and dealings with outsiders, especially merchants and foreign travelers. It functioned as a system of tutelage and brokerage, in which a local clan member, known as the Abban**,** acted as the formal intermediary between a guest, mainly traders or envoys. It ensured safe passage, negotiation of rights, and commercial facilitation across clan boundaries. This arrangement was not optional; it was obligatory and universally observed.[73] No foreigner or non local Somali could operate, move, or conduct trade in Somali territory without securing an Abban, whose role was not only customary but enforced by collective social expectation.[74][73] Ibn Battuta wrote of his travels to Mogadishu:[75]\n\n\"The host then sells his goods for him and buys for him, and if anyone buys anything from him at too low a price or sells to him in the absence of his host, the sale is regarded by them as invalid.\"\n\n\nFunctionally, the Abban served as an escort, broker, interpreter, and agent for facilitating trade and negotiations, managing all affairs on behalf of his client,[76][77] from introducing them to clan elders and Sultans, to overseeing every transaction and ensuring the client\u2019s protection. The Abban was also the referee in disputes, holding the authority to negotiate settlements or represent the client in cases of conflict.[78] This extensive role gave the Abban considerable power, as he received a fixed percentage from all commercial dealings and often extracted additional payments from his own clan members during the process. His lodging and food were provided by the guest, and without his permission, a traveler could neither make a march nor purchase any necessary item.[73] Though often viewed with suspicion by foreign observers due to the lack of checks on the Abban\u2019s conduct, the system was seen as indispensable and could not be waived at the whim of a visitor. It was, in essence, the earliest form of transit dues, a cost embedded in the structure of access and mobility.[76][78]\n\n\"It is naturally in the interest of the Abban to mediate as many transactions as possible for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He meets caravans on the road, establishes relationships with the merchants along the way, and obliges them with promises to sell their goods through him.\"\n\n\nBeyond economic matters, the Abban assumed personal and collective responsibility for the safety of his client and their property. As a member of the host, usually the dominant clan in the region where they passed,[79] his protection extended the force of collective clan honor; an attack on the traveler or their caravan was seen as an attack on the Abban\u2019s genealogical unit, his clan, and could therefore trigger inter clan retaliation.[74] In return, the Abban was bound to fight the battles of his client, if necessary, and if he were killed in the process, his tribe was expected to avenge him and compensate the client\u2019s losses.[76] If the client suspected theft, then the Abban would initiate a trial over the suspect. However the client would have to first pay a certain amount as honorarium.[78] This aspect made the system not only a practical arrangement but a morally binding pact grounded in Somali notions of collective responsibility and clan solidarity. The underlying principle of Abbanage therefore rested on a relational logic of mediation, where one party assumed responsibility for managing the outsider\u2019s integration, however temporary it was, into the existing moral and legal framework of Somali society.[79]\n\nThe Abban system was not only a mechanism of protection and mediation, but also a lucrative source of wealth for those who occupied the role.[73] Given the commissions from trade, the provision of lodging and food at the guest\u2019s expense, and the expectation of gifts or gratuities, serving as an Abban could bring significant material benefit. As a result, many Abbans cultivated long term relationships with visiting merchants, and in most cases, a merchant would return to the same Abban in future visits.[75]\n\n## Marriage\n\n[edit]Among Somali clans, in order to strengthen alliance ties, marriage is often to another ethnic Somali from a different clan. In a study of 89 marriages focusing on the Dhulbahante sub-clan, anthropologist I. M. Lewis noted that 62% were with women from the same clan but from differing subclans other than those of their husbands and 33.7% were with women of adjacent clans of other clan families 4.3% were with women of other clans of the same clan family.[80]\n\nSuch exogamy is always followed by the dia-paying group and usually adhered to by the primary lineage, whereas marriage to lineal kin falls within the prohibited \n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yusuf_Ali_Kenadid\n# Yusuf Ali Kenadid\n\n| Yusuf Ali Kenadid Yuusuf Cali Keenadiid | |\n|---|---|\nSultanLord of Alula [1] | |\n| 1st Sultan of Hobyo | |\n| Reign | April 1878 \u2013 28 September 1911 |\n| Predecessor | Monarchy established |\n| Successor | Ali Yusuf Kenadid (prince) |\n| Born | 1837 Alula, Majeerteen Sultanate |\n| Died | 1911 (aged 73\u201374) Hobyo, Hobyo Sultanate |\n| Spouse | Khadija Mohammed Hassan, Dahabo Islaan Aadan, Khadija, Awrala, Faduumo |\n| Issue | Ali Yusuf Kenadid, (prince Ali Yusuf) Osman Yusuf Kenadid, Muse Yusuf Kenadid, Mohammed Yusuf Kenadid, Asha Yusuf Kenadid, Mumina Yusuf Kenadid, Ahmed Yusuf Kenadiid |\n| Religion | Islam |\n\n**Yusuf Ali Kenadid** (Somali: *Yuusuf Cali Keenadiid*; 1837 \u2013 14 August 1911) was a Somali Sultan and the founder of the Sultanate of Hobyo. He was succeeded to the throne by his son Ali Yusuf Kenadid.[2][3]\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]Yusuf Ali Kenadid was born into the Bah Yaaqub (part of the larger Bah Dirooble) branch of the Osman Mahamuud, Majeerteen Darod family. He is the father of Osman Yusuf Kenadid, who would go on to create the Osmanya writing script for the Somali language.[4] Yusuf Ali's grandson, Yasin Osman Kenadid, would later help found the Society for Somali Language and Literature.[5]\n\nYusuf Ali was not a lineal descendant of the previous dynasties that governed over northeastern Somalia. He independently amassed his own fortune, and would later evolve into a skilled military leader commanding more senior troops. \"Kenadid\" was not his surname, but rather a title given to him by his rivals.[6]\n\nAs per custom among the period's prominent urban traders, to ensure commercial success in the interior, Kenadid married a local woman. While traveling to the coast in his capacity as a merchant prince, he would thereafter entrust his business affairs to his second wife, Khadija. Her duties during her husband's absence included maintaining the extant commercial transactions with the local population, collecting debts, securing loans, and safeguarding merchandise stock that had been acquired during previous journeys.[7]\n\nYusuf Ali's son, Ali Yusuf, succeeded him as Sultan of Hobyo.\n\n## Reign\n\n[edit]The sultanate of Hobyo originated from a rift within the Majeerteen Sultanate. The election of Yusuf Ali as Sultan by Bah Lelkase and Bah Yaqub in Alula (which from the time of Boqor Xawaadane had been designated as the residence of the Bah Yaqubs) was the origin of a dynastic conflict.[8]\n\nInitially, Yusuf Ali Kenadiid\u2019s goal was to seize control of the neighboring Majeerteen Sultanate, which was then ruled by his cousin and rival, Boqor Osman Mahamud. However, he was unsuccessful in this endeavour, and was eventually forced into exile in Yemen. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the Arabian Peninsula with a band of Hadhrami led by Husni Al Kathiri and with their assistance, he managed to overpower the local Habar Gidir clans in Mudug, and established the Sultanate of Hobyo in 1878.[9][10][11]\n\n### Hobyo-Italian protectorate treaty\n\n[edit]After consolidating his power in Hobyo, to protect himself from further Zanzibari hostility, he signed a protectorate treaty with Italy, still a power present only nominally. In fact, asking for protection from the English, already firmly established in 'Aden and Berbera, would have meant limiting one's autonomy and therefore one's ambitions. The Italian authorities were also informed by Yusuf Ali himself from the first contacts for the establishment of the protectorate. However, there was no direct intervention and this was probably the demonstration that the choice of Italy as protector could be the most congenial precisely because it was unable to intervene in the internal affairs of the Sultanate. And that was probably the reason why Keenadiid was able to later convince the more reluctant Boqor Cismaan to also accept the Italian protective umbrella over the Sultanate in Bari. Italian protection would play a very important role in the expansion of the Sultanate towards the interior. In 1889, when the protectorate agreement was signed, the sultanal power was only consolidated on a limited stretch of the coast: the agreement, on the other hand, recognized him as sovereign between Ras Awath (Cabaad), to the north, up to in Mereeg at noon, then the entire outlet to the sea of the Habar Gidir region. Instead, the northern part of Mudug, Cumar Maxamuud, was initially excluded from the agreement, including the Abgaal-Waceesle area of Mereeg which as we will see will be the source of subsequent conflicts. This protective umbrella was a guarantee from the interventions of other external powers among them Germany - but the expansion of the sovereignty of the Sultanate inwards was a personal initiative of the Sultan.[12]\n\nThe terms of each treaty specified that Italy was to steer clear of any interference in the sultanates' respective administrations.[13] In return for Italian arms and an annual subsidy, the Sultans conceded to a minimum of oversight and economic concessions.[14] The Italians also agreed to dispatch a few ambassadors to promote both the sultanates' and their own interests.\n\n## Exile\n\n[edit]The relationship between the Hobyo Sultanate and the Kingdom of Italy soured when Sultan Kenadid refused the Italians proposal to allow a British contingent of troops to disembark in his Sultanate so that they might then pursue their battle against Diiriye Guure and his emir Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's of the Dervish Movement.[15] Viewed as too much of a threat by the Italians, Sultan Kenadid was eventually exiled to Aden in Yemen and then to Italian Eritrea, as was his son Ali Yusuf, the heir apparent to his throne.[16]\n\n### Ali Suji\n\n[edit]According to Angus Hamilton, Cali Xaaji Axmed Aaden Suji was the highest ranked commander in the Dervish ranks in 1903, calling Ali Suji the dervish \"first lieutenant\". Angus also states that due to ALi Suji's high rank, Yusuf Ali Kenadid targeted Ali Suji rather than the Mullah:[17]\n\nIn this it seemed that the flocks and herds of Yusuf Ali were the object of the Mullah\u2019s attacks, so, by way of reprisals, the followers of the old Sheikh retaliated on the camels of the Mullah\u2019s first lieutenant,\n\nAli Suji. As a rule Somali raids are bloodless encounters, since it is contrary to the principle of Somali warfare to take life. The maxim of the tribesmen is: \u201c Covet your neighbour\u2019s wife; seize his ox or his ass or camel; wreck his happy home generally; but avoid bloodshed.\u201d\n\nAlthough in the early 1903 Ali Suji headed the dervish army, prior to the Ruuga battle he headed Dervish cavalry:[18]\n\nCali Xaaji Axmed Aaden oo ay Sayidka habrawadaag ahaayeen, Cali waxaa dhasay Balax Seed Magan, Sayidkana hooyadii waxaa la oron jiray Carro Seed Magan. Waxaa la yiri dagaalkii Ruuga ee Koofil ayaa lagu dilay Cali Xaaji Axmed oo fardaha Daraawiisheed buu madax ka ahaa, markii dagaalka foodda la is geliyey asaan wali la isu jilib dhigin, ayaa gaalkii girligaan Daraawiishta ku afuufay\n\n\nAli Haji Ahmed Aden who was the Sayid's maternal cousin, Ali was birthed by Balah Seed Magan, whilst the Sayid's mother was called Arro Seed Magan. It was said that in the fight of Ruuga (Dul Madoba) wherein Corfield was killed and where Ali Ahmed Suji was head of the Dervish cavalry, that once the fight was on the horizon yet not yet underway the colonizers machine gunned the Dervishes with an automatic firearm\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## Notes\n\n[edit]**^**Kapteijns, Lidwien; Spaulding, Jay (1992). \"From Slaves to Coolies: Two Documents from the Nineteenth-Century Somali Coast\".*Sudanic Africa*.**3**: 1\u20138.

He writes:\n\n\"According to local oral tradition, the Hiraab imamate was a powerful alliance of closely related groups who shared a common lineage under the Gorgaarte clan divisions. It successfully revolted against the Ajuran Sultanate and established an independent rule for at least two centuries from the seventeen hundreds and onwards.[3]\n\nThe alliance involved the army leaders and advisors of the Habar Gidir and Duduble, a Fiqhi\/Qadi of Sheekhaal, and the Imam was reserved for the Mudulood branch who is believed to have been the first born. Once established, the Imamate ruled the territories from the Shabeelle valley, the Benaadir provinces, the Mareeg areas all the way to the arid lands of Mudug.[3]\n\nThe agricultural centres of Eldher and Harardhere included the production of sorghum and beans, supplementing with herds of camels, cattle, goats and sheep. Livestock, hides and skin, whilst the aromatic woods and raisins were the primary exports as rice, other foodstuffs and clothes were imported. Merchants looking for exotic goods came to Hobyo to buy textiles, precious metals and pearls. The commercial goods harvested along the Shabelle river were brought to Hobyo for trade. Also, the increasing importance and rapid settlement of more southerly cities such as Mogadishu further boosted the prosperity of Hobyo, as more and more ships made their way down the Somali coast and stopped in Hobyo to trade and replenish their supplies.[3]\n\n### Sultanate of Hobyo\n\n[edit]By the late 19th century, the Imamate began to decline. At the start of Colonialism in Somalia in 1884, shortly after the Berlin Conference, a young ambitious rebel called Sultan Kenadiid of the Majeerteen, managed to conquer Hobyo and established The Kingdom of Hobyo in 1884.[5]\n\nFrom 1900 to 1910, Hobyo was ruled by Yusuf Ali Kenadid who established the Sultanate of Hobyo in 1884. As with the Majeerteen Sultanate, the Sultanate of Hobyo exerted a strong centralized authority during its existence, and possessed all of the organs and trappings of an integrated modern state: a functioning bureaucracy, a hereditary nobility, titled aristocrats, a state flag, as well as a professional army.[6][7] Both sultanates also maintained written records of their activities, which still exist.[8]\n\nInitially, Ali Yusuf Kenadid's goal was to seize control of the neighboring Majeerteen Sultanate, which was then ruled by his cousin Boqor Osman Mahamud. However, he was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and was eventually forced into exile in Yemen. A decade later, in the 1880s, Kenadid returned from the Arabian Peninsula on a British ship with a band of Hadhrami musketeers and a group of devoted lieutenants. With their assistance, he managed to establish a sultanate in 1884.[9][2][5]\n\nIn the late 19th century, all extant Somali monarchs entered into treaties with one of the colonial powers, Abyssinia, Britain or Italy except the Dhulbahante.[10] Likewise, in late 1888, Sultan Kenadid entered into a treaty with the Italians, making his realm an Italian protectorate. His rival Boqor Osman would sign a similar agreement vis-a-vis his own Sultanate the following year. Both rulers had signed the protectorate treaties to advance their own expansionist objectives. In signing the agreements, the rulers also hoped to exploit the rival objectives of the European imperial powers so as to more effectively assure the continued independence of their territories.[11]\n\nHowever, the relationship between Hobyo and Italy soured when Sultan Kenadid refused the Italians' proposal to allow a British contingent of troops to disembark in his Sultanate so that they might then pursue their battle against the Dervish forces.[12] Viewed as too much of a threat by the Italians, Sultan Kenadid was eventually exiled to Aden in Yemen and then to Eritrea, as was his son Ali Yusuf, the heir apparent to his throne.[13] However, unlike the southern territories, the northern sultanates were not subject to direct rule due to the earlier treaties they had signed with the Italians.[14]\n\n## Climate\n\n[edit]Hobyo has a hot arid climate (K\u00f6ppen *BWh*).\n\n| Climate data for Hobyo | |||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Month | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec | Year |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F) | 29.7 (85.5) |\n30.6 (87.1) |\n32.0 (89.6) |\n33.6 (92.5) |\n31.8 (89.2) |\n29.9 (85.8) |\n28.9 (84.0) |\n28.7 (83.7) |\n29.2 (84.6) |\n30.2 (86.4) |\n31.4 (88.5) |\n30.4 (86.7) |\n30.5 (87.0) |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F) | 22.1 (71.8) |\n22.8 (73.0) |\n23.8 (74.8) |\n24.6 (76.3) |\n24.1 (75.4) |\n22.7 (72.9) |\n21.7 (71.1) |\n21.8 (71.2) |\n22.2 (72.0) |\n23.1 (73.6) |\n23.1 (73.6) |\n22.6 (72.7) |\n22.9 (73.2) |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches) | 4 (0.2) |\n1 (0.0) |\n8 (0.3) |\n15 (0.6) |\n53 (2.1) |\n6 (0.2) |\n0 (0) |\n0 (0) |\n0 (0) |\n34 (1.3) |\n39 (1.5) |\n20 (0.8) |\n180 (7) |\nSource: Climate-Data.org, altitude: 3 metres or 10 feet[15]\n|\n\n## Demographics\n\n[edit]Hobyo has a population of around 11,800 inhabitants.[16] The broader Hobyo District has a total population of 67,249 residents.[17]\n\n## Transportation\n\n[edit]Hobyo has a seaport which serves the town.[18]\n\nFor air transportation, the city is served by the Obbia Airport.[19]\n\nIn August 2019, Qatar initiated a project to build the port of Hobyo as part of the development agreements signed between Somalia and Qatar in December 2018.[20][21]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Dhageyso Gudoomiyaha Hobyo oo ka Hadlay Shabaabka u dhow magaalada Hobyo\u2026\". 24 February 2017.- ^\n**a****b**Lee V.

It was in the 13th century the Ajuran first appeared and began gaining power. For several centuries they exerted strong political influence on the inland pastoralists, while also embracing coastal trade and infrastructure.[16] The sultanate functioned for approximately three centuries.[9]\n\n### Origins and the House of Garen\n\n[edit]The House of GareenKnown members |\n|---|\n|\n\nThe House of Garen was the ruling hereditary dynasty of the Ajuran Empire.[17][18] Its origin lies in the Garen Kingdom that during the 13th century ruled parts of the Somali Region of Ethiopia.[19] With the migration of Somalis from the northern half of the Horn region southwards, new cultural and religious orders were introduced, influencing the administrative structure of the dynasty.[20]\n\nA system of governance began to evolve into an Islamic government. Through their genealogical Baraka, which came from the saint *Balad* (who was known to have come from outside the Kingdom).[21][22][23]\n\n### Rise to prominence and dominance\n\n[edit]The Ajuran gradually became a notable and respected empire.[3] They rose to dominance in the interior of the Banaadir region in the late 1300s, after which they maintained hegemony for approximately three centuries. The introduction of a great variety of technological innovations are attributed to the empire, such as systems of dykes and dams on the Shabelle river, large homes and stone fortifications along with the creation of large stone wells, many of which were still in use well into the 20th century. Notably, the Ajuran were the first to impose a regular system of tribute on the surrounding populations.[24] The empire fielded a powerful army which employed firearms towards the end of its dominant period. As a 'water dynasty', the Ajuran monopolized the Jubba and Shabelle rivers through hydraulic engineering.[8]\n\nHistorically, the Sultanate of Mogadishu was confined by the Adal Sultanate in the north.[25][26] Throughout the Middle Ages, the Ajurans routinely aligned themselves politically with the Adalites.[27][28] Described as one country by Ibn Battuta, a journey to Mogadishu from the town of Zeila took him eight weeks to complete.[29][30] The Ajuran Empire's sphere of influence in the Horn of Africa was among the largest in the region.[31][32] At the height of its reach, the empire covered most of southern Somalia as well as eastern Ethiopia,[12][33] with its domain at one point extending from Hobyo in the north to Kismayo in the south, and Qelafo in the west.[34][35][36]\n\n### Ajuran-Portuguese battles\n\n[edit]\nThe European Age of Discovery brought Europe's then superpower the Portuguese Empire to the coast of East Africa, which enjoyed a flourishing trade with foreign nations. The southeastern city-states of Kilwa, Mombasa, Malindi, Pate and Lamu were all systematically sacked and plundered by the Portuguese.[37] Trist\u00e3o da Cunha then set his eyes on Ajuran territory, where the Battle of Barawa was fought.[38][39] After a long period of engagement, the Portuguese soldiers burned the city and looted it.[40][41] Fierce resistance by the local populace and soldiers resulted in the failure of the Portuguese to permanently occupy the city, and the inhabitants who had fled to the interior eventually returned and rebuilt the city.[42][43][44]\n\nAfter Barawa, Trist\u00e3o set sail for Mogadishu, the richest city on the East African coast.[45][46] Word had spread of what had happened in Barawa, and a large troop mobilization took place. Many horsemen, soldiers and battleships in defense positions were guarding the city. Nevertheless, Trist\u00e3o opted to storm and attempt to conquer the city, although every officer and soldier in his army opposed this, fearing certain defeat if they were to engage their opponents in battle. Trist\u00e3o heeded their advice and sailed for Socotra instead.[47][48]\n\nOver the next decades tensions remained high and the increased contact between Somali sailors and Ottoman corsairs worried the Portuguese who sent a punitive expedition under Jo\u00e3o de Sep\u00falveda, where he bombarded Mogadishu and captured Turkish vessels, compelling its ruler to sign a peace deal with the Portuguese. Barawa would also sign peace with the Portuguese after being sacked.[50][51] The Ottoman-Somali cooperation against the Portuguese on the Indian Ocean reached a high point in the 1580s when Ajuran clients of the coastal cities began to cooperate with the Arabs and Swahilis under Portuguese rule and sent an envoy to the Turkish corsair Mir Ali Bey for a joint expedition against the Portuguese. He agreed and was joined by a Somali fleet in order to attack the Portuguese colonies in Southeast Africa.[52]\n\nThe Somali-Ottoman offensive managed to drive out the Portuguese from several important cities such as Pate, Mombasa and Kilwa. However, the Portuguese governor sent envoys to Portuguese India requesting a large Portuguese fleet. This request was answered and it reversed the previous offensive of the Muslims into one of defense. The Portuguese armada managed to re-take most of the lost cities and began punishing their leaders, but they refrained from attacking Mogadishu, securing the city's autonomy in the Indian Ocean.[55][56] The Ottoman Empire would remain an economic partner.[12] Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries the Ajurans successively defied Portuguese hegemony on the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.[57][58][59][60]\n\n### Muslim migrations\n\n[edit]From the late 15th and up until the 17th centuries saw the arrival of Muslim families from Arabia, Persia, India and Spain to the Ajuran realm of territories, the majority of whom settled in the coastal provinces. Some migrated because of the instability in their respective regions, as was the case with the Hadhrami families from Yemen and Muslims from Spain fleeing the Inquisition.[61][62] Others came to conduct business or for religious purposes. Due to their strong tradition in religious learning, the new Muslim communities also enjoyed high status among the Somali ruling elite and commoners.[63][64]\n\n#### Bale\n\n[edit]The most famous Somali scholar of Islam from the Ajuraan period is Sheikh Hussein, who was born in Merca, one of the power jurisdiction and cultural centers of the Ajuran Empire.[65] He is credited with converting the Sidamo people living in the area of what is now the Bale Province, Ethiopia to Islam.[66] He is also credited with establishing the Sultanate of Bale.[67][68]\n\nDespite the Bale Sultanate not being directly under Ajuran rule, the two kingdoms were deeply connected and Bale was heavily influenced by Ajuran. His tomb lies in the town of Sheikh Hussein in what is considered the most sacred place in the country for Ethiopian Muslims, in particular those of Oromo ethnic descent.[69][70]\n\n### Gaal Madow Wars\n\n[edit]In the mid-17th century, the Oromo people collectively began expanding from their homeland towards the southern Somali coast at a time when the Ajurans were at the height of their power.[71] The Garen rulers conducted several military expeditions known as the *Gaal Madow* *Wars,* on the Oromo invaders, converting those that were captured to Islam.[72][73][74][75]\n\n### Fall of Benadir and Southern Somalia\n\n[edit]The Ajuran Empire slowly declined in power at the end of the 17th century. In this period the rulers of the empire abandoned Sharia, became oppressive and enacted heavy taxation.[9] The dethronement of the Muzaffar clients in Mogadishu and other coastal cities by the Abgaal imam who then established the Hiraab Imamate taking residence in Mogadishu was a significant setback,[76] and the defeat of the Silcis vassals by a former Ajuran general in the interior of the state, Ibrahim Adeer, who established the Gobroon dynasty.[77][78] By the early 1700s there was effectively no trace of Ajuran left in Banaadir.[24]\n\nTaxation and the practice of primae noctis were the main catalysts for the revolts against Ajuran rulers.[79] The loss of port cities and fertile farms meant that much needed sources of revenue were lost to the rebels.[78] Somali maritime enterprise significantly declined after the collapse of the Ajuran Empire. However, other principalities such as the Isaaq Sultanate, Warsangali Sultanate, Majeerteen Sultanate, and the Sultanate of Hobyo in a way ensured its continuity.[80]\n\n## Administration\n\n[edit]The Ajuran nobility used many of the typical Somali aristocratic and court titles, with the Garen rulers styled Imam.[81] These leaders were the empire's highest authority, and counted multiple Sultans, Emirs, and Kings as clients or vassals. The Garen rulers also had seasonal palaces in Mareeg, Qelafo and Merca, important cities in the Empire were Mogadishu and Barawa. The state religion was Islam, and thus law was based on Sharia.[82][83][84]\n\n- Imam \u2013 Head of State\n[85] - Emir \u2013 Commander of the armed forces and navy\n- Na'ibs \u2013 Viceroys\n[86] - Wazirs \u2013 Tax and revenue collectors\n- Qadis \u2013 Chief Judges\n\n## Citizenry\n\n[edit]\nThrough their control of the region's wells, the Garen rulers effectively held a monopoly over their nomadic subjects as they were the only hydraulic empire in Africa during their reign. Large wells made out of limestone were constructed throughout the state, which attracted Somali and Oromo nomads with their livestock.[87] The centralized regulations of the wells made it easier for the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials who would act as mediators. Long distance caravan trade, a long-time practice in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran times. Today, numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the medieval period.[88]\n\nWith the centralized supervision of the Ajuran, farms in Afgooye, Kismayo and other areas in the Jubba and Shabelle valleys increased their productivity. A system of irrigation ditches known locally as *Kelliyo* fed directly from the Shebelle and Jubba rivers into the plantations where sorghum, maize, beans, grain and cotton were grown during the *gu* (Spring in Somali) and *xagaa* (Summer in Somali) seasons of the Somali calendar. This irrigation system was supported by numerous dikes and dams. To determine the average size of a farm, a land measurement system was also invented with *moos*, *taraab* and *guldeed* being the terms used.[89]\n\n## Taxation\n\n[edit]The State collected tribute from the farmers in the form of harvested products like durra, sorghum and bun, and from the nomads, cattle, camels and goats. The collecting of tribute was done by a wazir. Luxury goods imported from foreign lands were also presented as gifts to the Garen rulers by the coastal sultans of the state.\n\nA political device that was implemented by the Garen rulers in their realm was a form of *ius primae noctis*,[90] which enabled them to create marriages that enforced their hegemonic rule over all the important groups of the empire. The rulers would also claim a large portion of the bride's wealth, which at the time was 100 camels.[87]\n\nFor trade, the Ajuran Empire minted its own Ajuran currency.[91] It also utilized the Mogadishan currency originally minted by the Sultanate of Mogadishu, which later became incorporated into the Ajuran Empire.[55] Mogadishan coins have been found as far away as present-day United Arab Emirates in the Middle East.[92]\n\n## Military\n\n[edit]\nThe Ajuran State had a standing army with which the governors ruled and protected their subjects. The bulk of the army consisted of recruited soldiers who did not have any loyalties to the traditional Somali clan system, thereby making them more reliable.[93][94][95] The soldiers were recruited from the inter-riverine area; other recruits came from the surrounding nomadic region. Arab, Persian and Turkish mercenaries were at times employed as well.[96][97]\n\nIn the early period, the army's weapons consisted of traditional Somali weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, battle axes, and bows. The Empire received assistance from the Ottoman Empire, and with the import of firearms through the Muzzaffar port of Mogadishu, the army began acquiring muskets and cannons.[98][99]\n\nThe Ottomans would also remain a key ally during the Ajuran-Portuguese wars. Horses used for military purposes were raised in the interior, and numerous stone fortifications were erected to provide shelter for the army in the coastal districts.[100] In each province, the soldiers were under the supervision of a military commander known as an Emir.[94] The coastal areas and the lucrative Indian Ocean trade was protected by a navy.[52]\n\n## Urban and maritime centers\n\n[edit]\nThe urban centers of Merca, Mogadishu, Barawa, and their respective ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating from the interior of the state.[101] The farming communities of the hinterland brought their products to the coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained foreign commerce with ships sailing to and from Arabia, India, Venice, Persia, Egypt, Portugal, and as far as China.[102][103][104][105]\n\nVasco da Gama, who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century[106] noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its centre and many mosques with cylindrical minarets.[107][108] In the 16th century, Duarte Barbosa noted that many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya sailed to Mogadishu with cloths and spices for which they in return received gold, wax and ivory.[109][110] Barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat, wheat, barley, horses, and fruit on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants.[111][112]\n\nMogadishu, the center of a thriving weaving industry known as *toob benadir* (specialized for the markets in Egypt and Syria),[113] together with Merca and Barawa also served as transit stops for Swahili merchants from Mombasa and Malindi and for the gold trade from Kilwa.[114] There were Jewish merchants from the Hormuz who brought their Indian textile and fruits to the Somali coast in exchange for grain and wood.[115][116]\n\nTrading relations were established with Malacca in the 15th century,[117] with cloth, ambergris and porcelain being the main commodities of the trade.[118] In addition, giraffes, zebras and incense were exported to the Ming Empire of China.[119] Hindu merchants from Surat and Southeast African merchants from Pate seeking to bypass both the Portuguese blockade and Omani interference used the ports of Merca and Barawa (which were out of the two powers' jurisdiction) to conduct their trade in safety.[120]\n\n### Major cities\n\n[edit]The Ajuran Empire was an influential Somali kingdom that held sway over several cities and towns in central and southern Somalia during the Middle Ages.[121] With the fall of the Sultanate, a number of these settlements continued to prosper, eventually becoming major cities in present-day Somalia.[122][123] A few were abandoned or destroyed:\n\n- Capital\n\n- Mareeg (initially) (town in the Galguduud region of Somalia)\n- Qelafo (town in the Somali Region of Ethiopia)\n- Merca (port city in the Lower Shebelle region of Somalia)\n- Mogadishu (harbor city and current capital of Somalia)\n\n- Port cities\n\n- Hobyo (harbor city in the Mudug region of Somalia)\n- Eyl (port town in the Nugal region of Somalia)\n- El Buur (town in the Galgaduud region of Somalia)\n- Kismayo (port city in the Lower Juba region of Somalia)\n- Barawa (port town in the Lower Shebelle region of Somalia)\n- Warsheikh (port town in the Middle Shebelle region of Somalia)\n\n- Other cities\n\n- Afgooye (town in the Lower Shebelle region of Somalia)\n- Baidoa (a city in the Bay region of Somalia)\n- Gondershe (abandoned, but now a popular tourist attraction site)\n- Hannassa (abandoned)\n- Ras Bar Balla (abandoned)\n\n## Economy\n\n[edit]The Ajuran Empire relied on agriculture and trade for most of its income. Major agricultural towns were located on the Shebelle and Jubba rivers, including Kismayo and Afgooye. Situated at the junction of some of the busiest medieval trade routes, the Ajuran and its clients were active participants in the East African gold trade, the Silk Road commerce, trade in the Indian Ocean, and commercial enterprise as far as East Asia.[12][124]\n\nThe Ajuran Empire also minted its own Ajuran currency. Many medieval bronze coins inscribed with the names of Ajuran Sultans have been found in the coastal Benadir province, in addition to pieces from Muslim rulers of Southern Arabia and Persia.[91]\n\nThrough the use of commercial vessels, compasses, multiple port cities, light houses and other technology, the merchants of the Ajuran Empire did brisk business with traders from the following states:\n\n| Trading countries in Asia | Imports | Exports |\n|---|---|---|\n| Ming Empire | celadon wares and their currency | horses, exotic animals, and ivory |\n| Mughal Empire | cloth and spices | gold, wax and wood |\n| Malacca Sultanate | ambergris and porcelain | cloth and gold |\n| Maldive Islands | cowries | musk and sheep |\n| Kingdom of Jaffna | cinnamon and their currency | cloth |\n| Trading countries in the Near East | ||\n| Ottoman Empire | muskets and cannons | textiles |\n| Safavid Persian Empire | textiles and fruit | grain and wood |\n| Trading countries in Europe | ||\n| Portuguese Empire | gold | cloth |\n| Venetian Empire | sequins | \u2013 |\n| Dutch Empire | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Trading countries in Africa | ||\n| Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo) | \u2013 | cloth |\n| Adal Sultanate | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Ethiopian Empire | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Swahili Coast | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Monomopata | gold and ivory | spices and cloth |\n| Gonderine Ethiopian Empire | gold \n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ibrahim_Adeer\n# Ibrahim Adeer\n\n| Ibrahim Adeer \u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0623\u062f\u064a\u0631 | |\n|---|---|\n| Sultan of the Geledi | |\n| Reign | late 17th century\u2013mid-18th century |\n| Predecessor | Monarchy established |\n| Successor | Mahamud Ibrahim |\n| Dynasty | Gobroon dynasty |\n| Religion | Islam |\n\n**Ibrahim Adeer** (Somali: *Ibraahin Adeer*, Arabic: \u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0623\u062f\u064a\u0631) was a Somali ruler. He founded the Sultanate of the Geledi. He subsequently established the Geledi sultanate's ruling house, the Gobroon dynasty, after having to successfully rebel and expel the Ajuran Sultanate and ruled large parts of Horn of Africa.[1]\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]In the late 17th century, Adeer, who was an Ajuran general at the time, gathered 12,000 members of the Geledi tribe, under the leadership of Ibrahim Adeer successfully pushed back the imperial Ajuran army out of Afgooye. He had united all Maay speaking people, Digil & Mirifle clans using both military and diplomatic means. Sultan Ibrahim repeatedly defeated the Ajuran army in numerous battles; marched through what is now known Bakool and Bay regions where he defeated the Madanle clan part of the imperial Ajuran confederacy, and Afgooye where he defeated the Silcis Dynasty also part of the imperial Ajuran confederacy. He marched towards Bardheere and Luuq in Gedo region where he expelled the Ajuran clan and established a garrison in Dolow. His final conquest when he marched south of Jubba valley reaching what is now known as Kismayo and quickly expelling the Ajuran imperial armies and in the process, he had conquered half the entirety of the Ajuran Empire.\n\nSultan Ibrahim, who was the son of Adeer Gobroon, thus became the first sultan of the new dynasty. His son, Mahamud Ibrahim, would later succeed him atop the throne.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## Notes\n\n[edit]**^**Abdullahi, Abdurahman (2017-09-18).*Making Sense of Somali History: Volume 1*. p. 62.

It was celebrated annually on the Somali new year alongside other festivals such as Nowruz. The martial arts festival later became a centralized tournament under the Sultanate of the Geledi. During the reign of Sultan Ahmed Yusuf, separate teams were established, each supported by an assembly of poets, female vocalists and dance groups throughout the duration of the contest.[4]\n\nIn the modern era, the festival evolved into a local attraction; particularly during the 1970s and 80s. It is still practiced annually in the southern Afgooye region.\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]The event itself consists of a mock fight between the people residing on each side of the river bed in the town of Afgooye. Symbolizing the defence of one's community and honor, it coincides with the start of the main harvest season. Istunka was originally performed in full combat gear, with battle-axes, swords and daggers. However, for safety reasons, performers later replaced those weapons with large sticks or batons.[2]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Istunka: A New Year's Ritual\".

It is the center of the Afgooye District. Afgooye is the third largest city of Southwest State.[1] Afgooye is one of the oldest towns on the lower Shebelle valley, 30 kilometers north of Mogadishu. Afgooye is the site of Lafoole college, the first college of education in Somalia, built on the site of the battle of Lafoole of 1896. Afgooye is also known for the Istunka, the annual \"stick fight\" carnival commemorating the New Year in the riverine region. It was a trade center for the Silcis Dynasty in the medieval period then fell under Ajuran rule. Around the late 17th century, Afgooye became the capital of Geledi Sultanate.[2]\n\n## Etymology\n\n[edit]In the Somali language, *Afgooye* translates to split mouth or open\/ split closing.\n\n## Location\n\n[edit]It is situated about 30 kilometres west of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.[3] The Shabelle River passes through the middle of the town.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Medieval Period\n\n[edit]The Silcis Dynasty were a section of Ajuran that governed the Afgooye district. Neither the Silcis nor the Ajuran developed the town, but limited themselves to controlling the caravan routes and collecting taxes and tribute. The Silcis center of power was in Lama Jiidle (present day Afgooye). Lama Jiidle means \"two roads\" in Somali.[4]\n\nThe Silcis imposed taxation on their subject clans, such as the Wacdaan, a fellow subclan of the Gurgate Hawiye, and the Geledi, a Rahanweyn subclan. According to Virginia Luling, \"The Sil'is imposed their dominion on the Geledi, who had to pay as tribute a measure (suus) of grain every day from each household; it was collected and loaded on a camel, others say a donkey. A tax was also imposed on those who brought their stock to water at the river\u201d. Barile also describes the taxes levied by the Silcis.[5]\n\nThe final ruler of the Silcis in Lama Jiidle (Afgooye) was the sultan 'Umur Abukar Abroone. According to Luling, \"His daughter Imbia used to go round collecting the daily tribute of grain, accompanied by her slaves\" from her father's Wacdaan and Geledi subjects. Oral accounts hold that one day, \"when the Sultan's daughter came round to collect the tribute, she got a beating instead of the grain\", as the Geledi refused to pay. When Imbia reported this event to her father, he exclaimed \"waa la i afgooye\", literally \"they have cut off my mouth\", meaning that the regime's source of provision had been terminated. Lama Jiidle's name became Afgooye to commemorate this victory over the Silcis.[6]\n\nThe Geledi mobilized and under Ibrahim Adeer a general who used to serve the Ajuran drove the Silcis out of Afgooye and established the Geledi Sultanate.[7]\n\n### Early Modern\n\n[edit]Afgooye was in its golden age in the early modern period under the reign of the Gobroon dynasty which was not only a powerful military machine but, by its use of Asraar or Ta'daar the feared \"secret mystical language\" was a formidable force in other respects as well. Afgooye at that time was a trading hub center controlling the trade route between the coast and interior. All roads were linked to Afgooye which gave the city immense leverage. During the early 19th century, the city's population was estimated to have exceeded 80,000 making it one of the largest cities in East Africa of that time.[2] The city was surrounded by a large wall with five fortified gates. It had many complex structures such as multi-story high buildings, big palaces in the center, mosques, residential houses, shops, roads, and bridges. They also built an advanced plumbing system, a drainage system, and a sewage system. The city was very vibrant and developed in its time.[8]\n\nThe Sultanate ruled most of the inter-riverine region and Benadir coast. Its headquarters was located in Afgooye which was an extremely wealthy and large city. Afgooye having some thriving industries such as weaving, shoemaking, tableware, jewellery, pottery and produced other various products. Afgooye was the crossroads of caravans bringing ivory, leopard skins, and aloe in exchange for foreign fabrics, sugar, dates, and firearms. Afgooyans also traded livestock and slaves. The outside inhabitants of Afgooye grew sorghum, beans, cotton, bananas, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. The Afgooyans say \"Laka Beere beerwaye\" (you can count on your farm), as opposed to the nomads who counted their camels. Afgooyans raised cows, goats, sheep, and chicken for meat, milk, and ghee. It is said that every household in Afgooye was wealthy and you could not find a single poor person.[2][9]\n\nAfgooye merchants boasted their wealth; one of their wealthiest said\n\n\nMoordiinle iyo Mereeyey iyo mooro lidow, maalki jeri keenow kuma moogi malabside.\n\nBring all the wealth of Moordiinle, Mereeyey, and the enclosures of lidow, I scarcely notice it.[2]\n\n### Italian Somaliland\n\n[edit]At the turn of the 20th century, Afgooye was incorporated into Italian Somaliland. The Italians occupied the town in 1908 and in the process abolished the local slave market.[10] There was also a station in Afgooye on the Mogadishu-Villabruzzi Railway, which connected the town to the capital Mogadishu.\n\n### Modern\n\n[edit]In the 1980s, Afgooye was a common destination for investors from the Gulf States. The Emir of Kuwait also reportedly used to visit the town during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, parts of the town became a place of refuge for many of southern Somalia's internally displaced people.[11]\n\nOn May 25, 2012, Somali government forces backed by AMISOM tanks re-captured Afgooye from Al-Shabaab, which had established a base in the area.[12]\n\n## Istunka Afgooye Festival\n\n[edit]Istunka, also known as *isgaraac*, was the name for annual mock combat festival in Afgooye, which marks the new year and one of the best known tourist attractions in the region.[13][14][15][16]\n\nThe festival was developed during the medieval Ajuran period. It was later expanded upon by Sultan Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon) becoming a centralized tournament separate teams were established, each supported by an assembly of poets, female vocalists and dance groups throughout the duration of the contest.[7]\n\nIn the modern era, the festival evolved into a local attraction; particularly during the 1970s and 80s. It is still practised annually in the town.\n\n## Demographics\n\n[edit]Afgooye has a population of around 79,400 inhabitants.[17] The broader Afgooye District has a total population of 135,012 residents.\nAfgooye District is predominantly inhabited by the Geledi and Garre clans with a small minority of Begedi clan all sub-clans of Digil\/Rahanweyn.[18]\n\n## Geodesy\n\n[edit]Afgooye is a geodetic datum used in Somalia. Afgooye datum is based on the Krasovsky ellipsoid and the Greenwich prime meridian.\n\n## Notable residents\n\n[edit]- Abdullahi Issa, Prime Minister of the Trust Territory of Somalia\n- Mohamed Osman Jawari, Speaker of the Federal Parliament of Somalia\n- Mustafa Mohamed Moalim, Chief of the Somali Air Force School and Operations\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]**^**\"Geography Population Map cities coordinates location - Tageo.com\".*www.tageo.com*.- ^\n**a****b****c**Mukhtar, Mohamed Haji (25 February 2003).**d***Historical Dictionary of Somalia*.

Having never cut weight as an amateur, Leduc fought at his walking weight 171 lbs. He lost by referee stoppage in the first round and would return to the cage in November 2015 to face future ONE Championship title contender Koyomi Matsushima, this time attempting to drop down to 155 lbs.[35] Matsushima won by referee stoppage in the first round after Leduc was caught by a hammer fist trying to secure a triangle choke.[36]\n\nOn July 12, 2014, Leduc took part in the controversial Prison Fight in Thailand, where inmates with serious convictions can reduce their sentences and even earn their freedom by winning a series of fights against foreign fighters.[37][38] Prison Fight is sanctioned by the Thai Department of Corrections and described as a way for inmates to battle their way to an early release.[39] The event took place in the maximum security Klongpai Central Prison, in Nakhon Ratchasima, two hours north of Bangkok.[5] Leduc faced Thahan Chor.Chatchai, an experienced Muay Thai fighter who competed multiple times at Lumpini Stadium, but was arrested and incarcerated for trafficking methamphetamine. Leduc won by unanimous decision and left the top of his opponent's head lacerated because of repetitive elbow strikes.\n\nWhen it came to fighting convicts, Leduc said to the *Bangkok Post* that *he wouldn't feel bad if he won and his rival's sentence wasn't reduced*.[40] Leduc explained to Argentinian news Infobae the mentality of the inmates at the Prison Fight events, saying:\n\n\"\n\nThey do not fight for money, they fight for their freedom. I only fight for honor and glory.\"[41]\"They deserve to get my 100%, if he wins, then he earns it.\"[40]\n\n### 2016-2017: Championship pursuit and *Lethwei in Japan*\n\n[edit]In April 2016, Leduc competed in the *2016 Tiger Muay Thai Tryouts* in Phuket, and went on to win a place on the professional fight team, along with teammate Dan Hooker.[42]\n\nOn August 21, 2016, Leduc was invited to make his Lethwei debut at the 1st Myanmar Lethwei World Championship in Yangon, Myanmar,[43] against Too Too, (34\u20130) undefeated, 75 kg Lethwei World Champion.[44][45] Leduc dominated the fight and some furious fans threw projectiles in the ring.[46] The fight ended in a draw according to traditional Lethwei rules.[47][27][48]\n\nAfter his dominant performance over Too Too, Leduc challenged Myanmar star Tun Tun Min, at the time, the Openweight Lethwei World Champion, however the Lethwei Golden Belt was not at stake.[49] The match was held at Thein Pyu Stadium and organized by Great Tiger Group. Tun Tun Min was the heavy favorite heading into the fight and dominated the early rounds. Leduc came back and floored Tun Tun Min a few times. The match was closely contested and ended in a draw according to traditional Lethwei rules.[50] After the match, Tun Tun Min was quoted saying that he had *\"difficulties with Dave's control of distance, but that he was confident to put on a better performance in their rematch\"* in December 2016.[51]\n\nOn December 11, 2016, the very anticipated rematch took place at the Air KBZ Aung Lan Championship in Yangon, Myanmar.[52] After previously fighting in October to a draw, Tun Tun Min put the openweight Lethwei Golden Belt on the line.[8] Leduc opened the fight offensively, landing a fake roundhouse kick to sidekick and a counter elbow on Tun Tun Min's face soon after the opening bell. Following these attacks, Tun Tun Min's usual bull rushing style was replaced by a noticeable slower pace. The round continued with aggressive attacks from both sides. In round three, Leduc caught Tun Tun Min's overextended leg and flipped him to the floor twisting his knee, forcing his team to call his time-out.[23] The third round continued with a visibly shaken Tun Tun Min. After a short exchange in the clinch followed by a final takedown, Tun Tun Min was not able to continue and forfeited. Leduc was awarded the Golden Belt, becoming the first non-Burmese fighter to hold the Lethwei openweight world title.[53][30][54]\n\nThe journey to the world title was captured by Canal D[55] as part of the Canadian documentary titled *La Fosse aux Tigres* which aired in November 2017.[56][57] The documentary follows Leduc training and traveling to Yangon to win the Lethwei world title.[58]\nThe movie was filmed in Canada, Thailand and Myanmar.[59]\n\nOn February 16, 2017, for the second event organized by the International Lethwei Federation Japan[60] Leduc headlined Lethwei in Japan 2 at the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo Dome City, Japan.[61] Leduc defended his title for the first time against veteran Lethwei fighter Phoe Kay.[62][63] In the first round, Leduc performed a vicious spinning elbow knockout, forcing Phoe Kay's corner to call the permitted time-out.[64] They revived him and the fight continued. In the second round, after several knockdowns, Leduc ended the match by KO, winning his first title defense.[65][66] The Japanese people loved the brutality and aggression of Lethwei, and more events were announced to be held in Tokyo.[67][68]\n\nOn April 18, 2017, for his second title defense,[69] Leduc faced Turkish Australian fighter Adem Yilmaz at Lethwei in Japan 3 in Tokyo, Japan[70] under traditional Lethwei rules.[71][66][72] This match was the first Lethwei world title fight headlining two non-Burmese in the sport's history. For the occasion, the Ambassador of Myanmar to Japan was present at the event held in the Korakuen Hall.[73] In the first round, Leduc scored two knockdowns and landed a powerful headbutt in the clinch. In the second round, Leduc dislocated his right index finger in the clinch and was not able to use his right hand the duration of the fight, but managed to land elbows and headbutts on Yilmaz. After five rounds, the fight was declared a draw according to traditional Lethwei rules with Leduc defending the Lethwei Golden Belt.[74][75]\n\nFor his third title defense, Leduc was set to face American Veteran Cyrus Washington at Lethwei in Japan 4 in Tokyo, Japan.[76] Washington pulled out of the fight citing a hand injury he sustained during training.[77][78] Leduc's opponent changed to Muaythai Champion Nilmungkorn Sudsakorngym from Thailand.[79][80] The matchup was billed as Lethwei vs. Muaythai.[79][81] Leduc made his entrance dressed as the grim reaper at the Tokyo Dome City Hall. In the first round, he landed a headbutt on Nilmungkorn, followed by a right-kick to right-punch move, hitting Nilmungkorn on the jaw forcing him to use his time-out. Leduc ended the match with a knee to the face winning by knockout at 2m:23sec of the second round.[82][83][84][85]\n\n\"I respect Cyrus a lot, he is a crafty veteran, he has fought some of the best fighters of the sport, but he has never fought anyone like me. I am not like the others, I'm the King of Lethwei and he wants a taste of the crown\", Leduc said in an interview.[86]\n\nOn August 20, 2017, Leduc faced Cyrus Washington inside the Thuwunna National Indoor Stadium in Yangon, Myanmar, to defend his openweight Lethwei world title, at the *Myanmar Lethwei World Championship*.[87] With more than 100 fights on his record, Washington was the more experienced fighter of the two with Leduc having only 22 fights.[88] During Leduc's rise in Lethwei, fans often entertained the idea of a match with Cyrus Washington and pushed for a fight between the two. Having been the only other fighter to score a win over Tun Tun Min,[89][90] Washington used his time-out and spent remaining of the fight backing up from Leduc and going to the mat upon entering in the clinch trying to protect his lacerated forehead from any further damage. The fight was officially declared a draw under traditional Lethwei rules.[91] and marked Leduc's fourth consecutive title defence in eight months.[92]\n\nOn 10 December 2017, Leduc faced former WKN world champion heavyweight kickboxer Corentin Jallon from France.[93][91] *\"Fighting him is gonna be like a crocodile bringing a gazelle in the water.\"* Leduc said.[94] Historically, the *Air KBZ Aung Lan Golden Belt Championship* was a kryptonite event for Lethwei champions, Leduc having won the title by defeating Tun Tun Min, who had won it from Saw Nga Man on the same stage. Inside the Thein Pyu Stadium in Yangon, Leduc executed his ceremonial fight dance Lethwei yay, announcing the start of the match. Just before the first exchange, Leduc challenged Jallon with the Lekkha moun. The Frenchman automatically replied with a flurry of punches, which Leduc countered with an elbow counterattack. In the third round, Leduc executed a diving headbutt which landed on Jallon's right eye, drawing blood. In the fourth round, Leduc had Jallon bent over the ropes from trying to avoid a headbutt.[95] Leduc opened deep cuts and heavily used his headbutts in the clinch.[10] In the fourth round, while he had Jallon's back, Leduc did a provocative humping movement behind him.[96][97] The fight was declared a draw according to traditional rules and Leduc retained the openweight Lethwei Golden Belt, marking his fifth consecutive title defence.[98][99]\n\n### 2018: Myanmar Lethwei World Championship and Tun Tun Min Trilogy\n\n[edit]On 19 August 2018, at the 3rd Myanmar Lethwei World Championship,[100] Leduc returned to face former Rajadamnern Stadium, WPMF and IKF Champion Diesellek TopkingBoxing inside the Thein Pyu Stadium in Yangon, Myanmar.[101]\n\nThe matchup was mediatized as *Lethwei vs Muaythai*. With more than 200 fights to his record, Diesellek was the more experienced fighter of the two, with Leduc having only 24 fights.[102] For this fight and for the first time in his career, Leduc flew his longtime trainer Sifu Patrick Marcil to Myanmar.[103] Prior to the bout, Leduc said in an interview that he respected Diesellek's left kick,[104] having knocked out current Lumpini Stadium and Rajadamnern Stadium champion Youssef Boughanem in brutal manner at Lumpini Stadium in 2012.[105]\n\nThe fight started with some exchanges in the clinch, with Diesellek trying the first headbutt of the fight which missed and Leduc landing a left uppercut.[106] Leduc continued with a fake right knee, fake left knee, followed by a right elbow, knocking out his opponent.[107] Diesellek's corner called for the allowed injury time-out and woke him up.[102] The fight resumed with Diesellek landing a left kick to Leduc's head. Leduc threw a fake kick to punch, followed by a knee to jaw knocking out Diesellek and breaking his jaw.[108] Leduc won by KO at 2:23 in the first round, marking his sixth title defence. He raised the Myanmar flag and performed the traditional victory dance Lethwei yay.[109]\n\nOn December 16, 2018, the very anticipated third match between Tun Tun Min took place at the *Air KBZ Aung Lan Golden Belt Championship* in Yangon. The fight was billed as *The Biggest Fight In Lethwei History*.[110][111] The third fight saw Leduc fighting out of the red corner, the first time a foreigner has been able to do so in the history of Lethwei, as it is customary to have non-Burmese fighters come out of the blue corner.[112] Tun Tun Min was fully recovered, but had tremendous difficulty with the distance control of Leduc. At 1:28 seconds of the first round, Leduc landed a headbutt to the temple in the clinch which floored Tun Tun Min, but managed to get up at the count of eight.\n\nAt the 2:35 of the same round, Leduc landed a jumping elbow that knocked out Tun Tun Min.[113] His team had to call for the 2-minute injury time-out to revive him and attend to a cut above his right eye.[114][115] The later rounds saw both fighters vying for a finish but ended without another knockout at the final bell and Leduc retained the Lethwei Golden Belt title.[116]\n\n### 2019\u20132023: WLC, Lethwei in USA and vacating title\n\n[edit]In 2017, Leduc had expressed his disagreement with the World Lethwei Championship's usage of the modern Lethwei rules also known as *Tournament rules*.[117] In 1996, the tournament rules was created by the MTLF and added to some tournaments by removing the controversial injury time-out and adding a decision to determine a winner in the occasion there was no knockout.[72] \"*It's no secret that I have had real concerns at the beginning about the modern ruleset of WLC. Looking back I think it was more a territorial feud, I was protecting my territory.*\" Leduc told VICE[7]\n\nOn March 9, 2019, despite a long-running feud with the promotion,[118] Leduc announced that he had signed an exclusive contract with the World Lethwei Championship which would make it impossible for him to defend his world titles from other Lethwei organizations.[119]\n\nOn March 25, 2019, Leduc held a press conference at the Karaweik Palace in Yangon, Myanmar announcing that he was relinquishing three of his four Lethwei world titles.[120] The three titles included the *MLWC Title*, *Air KBZ Aung Lan Championship title* and the *ILFJ Openweight Lethwei World title*,[121] but keeping the Lethwei Golden Belt, therefore remaining the openweight Lethwei World Champion under traditional rules.[122] Leduc became the sports channel ambassador for Canal+ Myanmar.[123][6]\n\nIn 2019, for his promotional debut at World Lethwei Championship, Leduc was set to face TUF 11 & TUF 25 competitor and UFC veteran Seth Baczynski.[124][125][6] The bout was scheduled as the main event of WLC 9: King of Nine Limbs inside Mandalar Thiri Indoor Stadium in Mandalay, Myanmar[126] for the inaugural Cruiserweight World Lethwei Championship.[127][128] Baczynski felt confident leading up to the fight because he had significantly more fighting experience than Leduc.[129] The weigh ins and face-off was officiated by Full Metal Dojo founder Jon Nutt presenting the WLC belt.[130] On August 2, 2019, Leduc landed an elbow strike which exploded Bacynski's left ear[131] and then knocked him out with punches to win the inaugural Cruiserweight World Lethwei Championship.[132][133] Following his performance, Leduc was invited on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast by Joe Rogan and both men discussed Lethwei.[134] Leduc announced that the WLC had plans to host an event in the United States.[135]\n\nOn 7 November 2020, Leduc was challenged by American Cyrus Washington for the second and final time to determine who is the best foreign Lethwei fighter.[136][137] The fight was under traditional Lethwei rules at the Outlaw Saloon in Cheyenne, Wyoming inside a cage and Leduc won the fight by TKO.[138][139][140] Leduc retained the Lethwei openweight world title.[141]\n\nOn January 29, 2023, Leduc officially vacated the openweight Lethwei World Championship title before the fight between Tun Tun Min and Thway Thit Win Hlaing. As soon as the fight started the title was up for grabs.[142] In the event where the champion vacates the title, the two top contenders are required to fight for the belt. In these cases, in order to have a champion, the fight cannot end in a draw, a winner must obligatory be declared even if there is no knockout. Tway Thit Win Hlaing was awarded the title[142] and succeeded Leduc as Myanmar openweight champion.[143]\n\n### Retirement fight: Kun Khmer rules vs. Prom Samnang\n\n[edit]In 2023, the World Lethwei Federation agreed for Prom Samnang from Cambodia to challenge Leduc because of his extensive winning streak in Kun Khmer.[144][145][146] The match was scheduled to take place in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica,[147] but was cancelled because Samnang was denied a Schengen visa to enter Slovakia.[4]\n\nIn August 2023, Leduc announced that he was set to retire completely from professional fighting and will fight one more time under Kun Khmer in Cambodia.[148][149] Leduc stated he would compete under Kun Khmer rules out of respect for the host country.[150] Leduc invited the Prime Minister of Cambodia His Excellency Hun Manet to attend his match against Prom Samnang. Manet respond and agreed to meet Leduc when he comes to Kingdom of Cambodia.[151]\n\nOn November 3, 2023, Leduc and Samnang were invited to the Peace Palace in Phnom Penh to meet with Prime Minister of Cambodia His Excellency Hun Manet. Manet was quoted saying that the match between the two fighters *will reflect mutual respect and contribute to strengthen the ties of fri\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_aJDkzPZBNQHKLWCxbU4lU71d\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Prom Samnang honoured 'honoured by' 'Hun Manet' 'honored' fighter Prom Samnang honoured Hun Manet 'honoured by general'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Prom Samnang - Wikipedia\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prom_Samnang\nProm Samnang is a Cambodian Kun Khmer fighter.

Since its launch in 2012, the summit has evolved from a platform primarily for Bangladeshi artists into one of the largest international gatherings for contemporary art in South Asia, with a particular focus on new commissions and cross-disciplinary collaborations.\n\nUnlike art fairs, the Dhaka Art Summit does not involve sales and is free to the public. The summit brings together artists, architects, curators, writers, and researchers from around the world, showcasing a wide range of works including painting, sculpture, film, performance, photography, craft, and digital media. It also hosts talks, critical writing ensembles, children\u2019s workshops, and scholarly conferences, encouraging dialogue across disciplines and geographies.\n\nThe summit is recognised for commissioning ambitious new works by Bangladeshi and international artists, often on themes connected to climate change, migration, identity, and South Asia\u2019s cultural histories. It is now considered one of the most significant art events in the Global South, drawing more than half a million visitors in recent editions.[4][5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\n| Title | Date | Director | Artists | Visitors |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n1st Dhaka Art Summit 2012 |\n12\u201315 April 2012 | 200 | 20,000 | |\n2nd Dhaka Art Summit 2014 |\n7\u20139 February 2014 | Diana Campbell Betancourt | 250 | 70,000 |\n3rd Dhaka Art Summit 2016 |\n5\u20138 February 2016 | Diana Campbell Betancourt | 300 | 138,000 |\n4th Dhaka Art Summit 2018\n|\n2-10 February 2018 | Diana Campbell Betancourt | 350 | 317,000 |\n5th Dhaka Art Summit 2020\n|\n7-15 February 2020 | Diana Campbell Betancourt | 500 | ~500,000 |\n6th Dhaka Art Summit 2023\n|\n3-11 February 2023 | Diana Campbell Betancourt | 160+ | 500,000+ |\n\n## Editions\n\n[edit]### 2012\n\n[edit]The 1st edition of the Summit was held in collaboration with Shilpakala Academy and Bangladesh National Museum[8][9][10][11][12] and showcased the works of 249 artists and 19 galleries.[13][14] The 1st edition of the Summit focused only on the local artists and galleries.

The event drew more than 317,000 visitors.[34][35][36]\n\n### 2020\n\n[edit]The 5th edition of the Dhaka Art Summit, titled \"Seismic Movements\", was held from 7\u201315 February 2020 at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, Dhaka. Under Chief Curator Diana Campbell Betancourt, the nine-day summit emerged as the most ambitious edition to date, featuring participation from over 500 artists, curators, architects, scholars, thinkers, and representatives from more than 44 countries[37]\nThe exhibition revolved around layered notions of movement\u2014geological shifts, colonial legacies, independence movements, social revolutions, feminist futures, and spatial mobilities\u2014translated into immersive artworks, performances, installations, and discursive programming. A major highlight was Adri\u00e1n Villar Rojas\u2019s installation New Mutants, a floor-encrusted tableau of 400-million-year-old fossils, serving as a meditation on deep time and planetary precarity.\nThe summit also featured a research installation titled \"Geographies of the Imagination,\" curated by SAVVY Contemporary and Jothashilpa, which presented layered timelines of colonial and partition histories through cinema banner painting by Mohammad Shoaib, a veteran cinema banner painter, highlighting parallel legacies across Asia and Africa.\n\nThe Collective Body\u2014curated by Diana Campbell and Kathryn Weir with assistant curator Kehkasha Sabah\u2014brought together more than thirty collaborative, artist-led initiatives (around half from Bangladesh) to foreground community-rooted practices and cross-regional exchange across Asia, Africa, Central & South America, and Oceania.[38] DAS 2020 also hosted MAHASSA (Modern Art Histories in and across Africa, South and Southeast Asia), a research collaboration between Dhaka Art Summit, Cornell University\u2019s Institute for Comparative Modernities, and Asia Art Archive, supported by the Getty Foundation\u2019s Connecting Art Histories initiative; its February 2020 Dhaka session featured seminars and panels on modern architecture, art schools, collectives, and more.[39] Exhibition-making at DAS 2020 was shaped by Srijan-Abartan, a cross-cultural workshop for exhibition design led by common-interest (with support from Pro Helvetia) that developed ecologically sustainable, locally rooted display strategies for the Summit and published its process as open-access research.[40]\n\n### 2023\n\n[edit]The sixth edition of the Dhaka Art Summit, titled \u09ac\u09a8\u09cd\u09af\u09be\/Bonna, was held from 3 to 11 February 2023 at the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. The title, meaning \"flood\" in Bangla and also a common female name, served as a central metaphor for the exhibition's themes of fluidity, collective healing, and the transformative power of water in the context of the climate crisis and geopolitical challenges. [41]\n\nA major highlight was Very Small Feelings, co-commissioned with the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in New Delhi, where the project later travelled. The summit also presented significant projects by artists such as Joydeb Roaja, Miet Warlop, Sumayya Vally, Ashfika Rahman, Antony Gormley, and Afrah Shafiq.

Rejecting the traditional biennale format to create a more generative space for art and exchange, DAS\u2019s interdisciplinary programme concentrates its endeavours towards the advancement and promotion of South Asia\u2019s contemporary and historic creative communities, building alliances through shared values with international practices and initiatives. Chief Curator Diana Campbell leads the Summit with international key curators, artists, and thinkers.\n\n##### The Dhaka Art Summit (DAS) is an international, non-commercial research and exhibition platform for art and architecture related to South Asia. With a core focus on Bangladesh, DAS re-examines how we think about these forms of art in both a regional and an international context.\n\nFor each edition of DAS, Bangladeshi artists shortlisted for the Samdani Art Award exhibit their work under the guidance of an international guest curator. Organised in partnership with the Delfina Foundation, the Award has created an internationally recognised platform for the work of young Bangladeshi artists. Many shortlisted artists have later exhibited or acquired by international exhibitions and institutions, such as Tate, SF MoMA, the Kunsthalle Zurich, Gwangju Biennale, Singapore Biennale, Lyon Biennale, Asia Pacific Triennial, Sharjah Biennial, Para Site, and many others.\n\n\nAll of DAS\u2019s exhibitions are supported by an ambitious commissions programme, which invites internationally acclaimed contemporary artists related to South Asia to create new work. Past commissions include Lynda Benglis, Simryn Gill, Po Po, Rasheed Araeen, Damian Ortega, Nilima Sheikh, Monika Sosnowska, Daniel Steegmann Mangrane, along with and some of the most exciting names from the region: Sheela Gowda, Ayesha Sultana, Waqas Khan, Munem Wasif, Zihan Karim, Randhir Singh, Seher Shah, Reetu Sattar, Ramesh Mario Nithiyendran, Kamruzzaman Shahdin, Yasmin Jahan Nupur, Tanya Goel, and many more.\n\nCelebrated for its critically acclaimed exhibitions by local and international arts professionals, many of DAS\u2019s past projects have toured internationally to venues and festivals, including Para Site in Hong Kong; TS1 in Yangon; the Modern Art Museum in Warsaw; the Berlin Biennale; the Gwangju Biennale; the Singapore Biennale; the Queens Museum, New York; Kunsthalle Basel, Switzerland; Artspace in Sydney; the Office for Contemporary Art Norway; the San Jose Museum of Art, USA; the Liverpool Biennial; Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Sri Lanka; Kunsthall Trondheim, Norway; and MAIIAM Contemporary Art Museum, Thailand.\n\n\nFree to the public and ticketless, DAS 2023 drew over half a million visitors across its nine-day duration. Expanding from its initial South Asia mandate, DAS 2018 created new connections between South, South East Asia, and the Indian Ocean belt, exhibiting artists from Thailand, Malaysia, Madagascar, the Philippines, and several other countries. DAS 2020 expanded further to connect widely across the Global South based on shared struggles rather than current geopolitical definitions. DAS 2023 took a planetary approach through the lens of climate change.\n\n\n##### SEVENTH EDITION\n\n### TONDRA\n\nWe are pleased to introduce you to the theme we have been dreaming up with our curators and art mediators for the 7th edition of DAS - TONDRA. The meaning of the word TONDRA in Bangla can be described as a state of existence where reality and dreams collide; a lucid dream that captivates the soul.\n\n\nTONDRA is also a common female name in Bangladesh, which became popular during the mid 1990s-2000s for a character named Tondra in a novel by the Bangladeshi author Humayun Ahmed. Our story of TONDRA emerged from heartbreak expressed by a young visitor at DAS 2023, who wrote messages for a woman named TONDRA on the walls of our exhibition such as \u201cEveryone is here, but you are missing from my life\u201d. His writing style ranged from graffiti to poetry, referring to his Tondra as \u2018a cloudy day\u2019 and other beautiful metaphors that connected his deepest personal feelings for his beloved to the stories and films of Humayun Ahmed.\n\n##### FIFTH EDITION\n\n### DAS 2020\n\n### \u09b8\u099e\u09cd\u099a\u09be\u09b0\u09a3 \/ Seismic Movements\n\nInspired by the geological reading of the word \u2018summit\u2019 as the top of a mountain, Seismic Movements: Dhaka Art Summit 2020 (DAS 2020) considers the various ruptures that have realigned and continue to shift the face of our spinning planet. Seismic movements do not adhere to statist or nationalist frameworks. They join and split apart tectonics of multiple scales and layers; their epicentres don\u2019t privilege historical imperial centres over the so-called peripheries; they can slowly accumulate or violently erupt in an instant.\n\n##### FOURTH EDITION\n\n### DAS 2018\n\nThe fourth edition of the Dhaka Art Summit (DAS) took place from 2 to 10 February 2018, featuring both an Opening Celebration Weekend (February 2\u20134) and a closing Scholars\u2019 Weekend (February 8\u201310), and several tiers of new programming. Produced and primarily funded by the Samdani Art Foundation, DAS 2018 was held in a public-private partnership with the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, the country\u2019s National Academy of Fine and Performing Arts, with support from the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Ministry of Information of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, the National Tourism Board, the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), and in association with the Bangladesh National Museum.\n\n- Jonathan Shaughnessy, Associate Curator, Contemporary Art | Conservateur associ\u00e9, art contemporainNational Gallery of Canada | Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts du Canada (DAS 2020)\n\n\"I feel most fortunate to have had the chance to return to the 2020 Dhaka Art Summit after my initial visit in 2016. The focus on collective practices, \u201cSouth to South\u201d and indigenous networks that guided the programming within the context of Seismic Movements was grounded, insightful, and provided many crucial perspectives on the otherwise often untethered expanses of today\u2019s \u201cglobal\u201d art world. A dynamic gathering of artists, minds, and both general and specialized audiences, the strength of DAS (notwithstanding the clear breadth of research, organization and planning that goes into it) is that it is a platform that knows concertedly from where it speaks, and to what ends it serves, while fostering timely and urgent conversations across local, national, and international lines.\"\n\n- Alain Berset, President of Switzerland (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s intense and you can feel lot of energy - this is somehow logical when you think of Bangladesh as a country with 160 million inhabitants and a very young population - you can actually feel the energy in the exhibition.\u201d\n\n- Elisabeth van Odijk, Director, Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten, Amsterdam (the Netherlands) (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cVisiting Dhaka Art Summit 2018 was an interesting and challenging experience. A great opportunity to get more insight in contemporary art from e.g. Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, in the recent \u2018art history\u2019 of South Asia and in the \u2018cultural\u2019 discourse going on. I am more than impressed by the level and richness delivered by the Art Summit as well as by the open and transparent atmosphere. I learned a lot. The visit broadened my insight into cultural developments in South Asia, and enriched my professional network at different levels. I am looking forward to the next edition!\u201d\n\n- Gregor Muir, Director of Collection, International Art, Tate (DAS 2020)\n\n\"Dhaka Art Summit reveals itself in wonderful myriad ways. That the summit centres on the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy makes perfect sense, allowing for easy manoeuvring between exhibitions, talks, performances and outdoor sculpture. There was much to discover, and a sense of liveliness throughout. Above all, I shall never forget the engagement of the local people whose enthusiasm added to an air of excitement.\"\n\n- Sophie Goltz, Assistant Professor, NTU Centre for Contemporary Art, Singapore (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cDAS 2018 gave us a great opportunity not only to learn about South \/ South East Asian Art but much more to learn how we can engage in our time through art. The manifold conversations, guided tours and lectures challenged and expanded not only the knowledge about art from Asia but also about the Bengal region and its historical and contemporary cultural richness. The educational complexity of DAS gives young people such an important opportunity to learn thinking out of the (academic) box.\u201d\n\n- Glenn Lowry, Director, Museum of Modern Art New York (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cThe Dhaka Art Summit was a revelation. Sharply insightful exhibitions, expansive and generous conversations and panel discussions, and a deeply satisfying experience. I learned a great deal, made unexpected connections, and enjoyed being with so many artists, curators, and scholars whose collective energy animated the Summit.\u201d\n\n- Koyo Kouoh, Founding Artistic Director, RAW Material Company (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cThere is so much to share from this stimulating, inspiring, politically engzged, art historically facinating, sensual, joyful and last but not least simply beautiful show that is the Dhaka Art Summit. Bringing together nine tightly curated exhibitions by a group of the most talented curators practicing today, as well as a though provoking series of screenings, conversations, presentations, performances and symposia; not to mention the incredible education programme with some of the most critically practicing artists, artist\u2019s collectives and thinkers, amazing Diana has completed yet another tour de force for which she can only be highly commended for its curatorial, intellectual, historical and contemporary scop, depth of research and unlimited sense of hospitality.\u201d\n\n- Shuddhabrata Sengupta, Artist, Raqs Media Collective (DAS 2018)\n\n\"The Dhaka Art Summit 2018 has been an intense, exhilarating and thought provoking experience. The curated exhibitions at DAS 2018 offer opportunities to rethink global histories of contemporary art while remaining anchored in a cogently and sharply expressed South Asian context. I had many wonderful experiences and exchanges and was able to get a clear sense of the energy and enthusiasm of the Bangladeshi Contemporary Art scene. The production values of the entire show set a very high standard. DAS is emerging as probably the most significant intersection of creative and discursive energies in the region. With DAS, the artistic and creative communities of Bangladesh stake their claim to being the incubators and custodians of a contemporary cultural sensibility that is truly planetary. This initiative\u2019s continued success is crucial for the health of culture in the entire South Asian region.\"\n\n- Beatrix Ruf, Director, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (DAS 2014)\n\n\"What a memorable experience the Dhaka Art Summit and Samdani Art Foundation organised. An amazing attendance of artists, curators, art professionals and collectors and the challenging and thought provoking panel discussions enabled meetings of people, intensive exchange and an insight not only into how art is integrating in Dhaka and Bangladesh but all of South Asia.\"\n\n- Sebastian Cichocki, Deputy Director and Chief Curator, Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cDAS is not only a show, it is a self-learning apparatus, which changes the patterns of understanding, recognition and global dissemination from the South Asia region. DAS is a polyphony of voices, resonating deep in the contemporary art world but also locally, triggering the imagination of diverse audiences and touching upon the most urgent social, political and economic issues of our times. DAS might be defined also as a free academy, conceptual playground and a carnival. DAS is also a story-teller. One can learn a lot just from listening carefully.\u201d\n\n- Jitish Kallat, artist and curator of Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2014 (DAS 2014)\n\n\"I leave Dhaka, carrying with me a whole lot of generative ideas, great thoughts and memories.I feel what I witnessed is truly historic and will be discussed as a key transformative catalyst for the entire region in the many years to come. Congratulations to Rajeeb and Nadia Samdani and Diana Campbell Betancourt on this whole-hearted visionary effort.\"\n\n- Philippe Pirotte, Dean of the Staedelschule, Frankfurt (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cFor me the Dhaka Art is a welcome alternative to the biennale circuit. Assuming in a discursively responsible way that such initiatives become more and more condensed events, in a global competition for attention, the Dhaka Art Summit, advances the notion of the \u201csummit\u201d which allows for very different, yet all interesting projects and initiatives, to share a venue, in which conceptual diversity is preferred over the constraints of one curatorial premise. Talks, exhibitions, prizes, documentaries, and even a fair of artist initiatives enrich each other in new surprising ways. Maybe the Dhaka Art Summit is not only an interesting answer to the often fatigue perceived in the biennale circuit but also to the global inflation of art fairs.\u201d\n\n- Jessica Morgan, The Daskalopoulos Curator, International Art, Tate Modern (DAS 2014)\n\n\"I heard over and over that Dhaka Art Summit had managed the complicated and sometimes impossible by bringing together artists, thinkers and curators from South Asia, providing a meeting place and a discursive space which is really to be applauded. The entire event was outstandingly well organised and installed. It was really exceptional to have the live encounter with Nikhil Chopra's performance and without doubt it was the presence of works like his, Shilpa Gupta, Naeem Mohaiemen, Rashid Rana and Mithu Sen, among others, who made work specially for the event, that brought a unique aspect to Dhaka Art Summit.\"\n\n- Maria Lind, Critic and Artistic Director, Gwangju Biennale 2016 (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cI almost gave up reading art writing. I have come to reconsider this through the Summit...\u201d\n\n- Adam Szymczyk, Artistic Director, Documenta 14 (DAS 2014)\n\n\"The Summit was a surprisingly personal, low key and highly focused gathering of many amazing individuals from several countries in South Asia. A variety of experiences brought under one roof was what I really appreciated as it exceeded the usual monoforms of a \"biennial\", \"art fair\", \"conference\" etc., offering instead a holistic experience of being with the artists, seeing their work and discussing it on the spot. Unpretentious and intelligently designed in skillful hands of Chief Curator, Diana Campbell, the Summit felt like it was a labour of love and not a dull cultural marketing exercise.\"\n\n- Lucas Huang, The National Gallery of Singapore (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cI thought the Dhaka Art Summit 2016 was a splendid affair of critical clout and great programming. There is literally nothing like it in Asia and I am certain the next one will be an even bigger success.\u201d\n\n- Dayanita Singh, Artist, India (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cI have never experienced something as art focused, open and inclusive as I just did at Dhaka Art Summit. The calibre of the conversations was a rare happening in our region.\u201d\n\n- Stuart Comer, Chief Curator of Media and Performance, Museum of Modern Art, New York (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cThe Dhaka Summit proved to be an invaluable interface with a number of key artists, discourses, and histories that suggest the increasingly urgent voice South Asia has in the current global cultural discourse....We look forward to developing many of these conversations as we deepen our engagement in the region.\u201d\n\n- Bunty Chand, Director of Asia Society, India (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cDhaka Art Summit has set the gold standard for the visual arts in South Asia\u201d\n\n- Frances Morris, Director of Tate Modern, London, UK, On her second trip to Dhaka, Bangladesh (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cThe Dhaka Summit has rapidly become an important focus for artists from South Asia and beyond and this year is attracting widespread international attention.\u201d\n\n##### THIRD EDITION\n\n### DAS 2016\n\nDAS provokes reflections on transnationalism, selfhood and time with invited artists, curators and thinkers who build exhibitions through commissioned research and experience within the region\u2014without being prescriptive. Neither a biennial, symposium nor festival but somewhere in between, the unique format of the Summit transforms the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy into a generative space to reconsider the past and future of art and exchange within South Asia and beyond. DAS 2016 included loans from the Bangladesh National Collection; the Museum Folkwang in Essen; the Pinault Collection and many public and private South Asian collections as well as partnerships with institutions such as the Centre Pompidou; Asia Art Archive and Harvard South Asia Institute, DAS considers South Asia from the view of doing and becoming rather than cartography, occupying the triplet planes of imagination, will and circumstance.\n\n##### SECOND EDITION\n\n### DAS 2014\n\nThe 2nd edition of the Dhaka Art Summit unfolded from February 7 to 9, 2014 at the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. Marking a strategic shift, the Summit decided to concentrate its focus on South Asia starting from this edition. DAS 2014 showcased a diverse array of programs, including five curatorial exhibitions by both international and Bangladeshi curators, along with 14 solo art projects curated by Diana Campbell Betancourt, the Artistic Director of the Samdani Foundation. These projects celebrated artists from across South Asia. The summit encompassed a citywide public art initiative, performances, the screening of experimental films, speaker panels, and the active participation of 15 Bangladeshi and 17 South Asia-focused galleries.\n\n##### FIRST EDITION\n\n### DAS 2012\n\nThe 1st edition of the Summit was held in collaboration with Shilpakala Academy and Bangladesh National Museum and showcased the works of 249 artists and 19 galleries. The 1st edition of the Summit focused only on the local artists and galleries. The Summit was visited by over 40,000 visitors The Summit also organised talks.\n\nFollowing the fifth edition subtitled Seismic Movements which welcomed nearly 500,000 visitors in nine days in February 2020, its sixth edition is the first edition with a Bangla subtitle; \u09ac\u09a8\u09cd\u09af\u09be\/Bonna.\n\n\nDAS 2023 considers the ways in which we inherit and form vocabularies to understand the world around us, and the mistranslation that can ensue when we try to apply these vocabularies to unfamiliar contexts; the same word can migrate from positive to negative connotations and back depending on how and where it travels. Weather and water as shapers of history and culture as well as being metaphors for life in general are viewed in an embodied way through the lens of those who live in Bangladesh, next to the sea and rivers, underneath the storm systems, feeling the wind and rain.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_4nG9LRHrgCK1xBvGvnScuLF0\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy location 'Shilpakala Academy' address 'Dhaka' 'Sher-e-Bangla Nagar' 'Segunbagicha'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy - Wikipedia\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bangladesh_Shilpakala_Academy\nLocation.

You inherit one HFE gene from each of your parents. The HFE gene has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D. Genetic testing can reveal whether you have these changes in your HFE gene.\nQ: How do you treat H63D hemochromatosis?\nA: The standard treatment of HFE-hemochromatosis is simple, as the body's excess iron is removed by repeated lettings of whole blood (phlebotomy) [63, 64]. It is an effective and low-cost procedure to reduce iron overload and there are few side effects.\nQ: What are the diseases associated with HFE?\nA: HFE HC has been described as bronze diabetes with cirrhosis, primary hemochromatosis, genetic hemochromatosis, hereditary hemochromatosis, and hemochromatosis type 1.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_ddPdYL99Tty7wpKphAqA6DiY\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.042701499\\\",\\\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/11867720\/\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.042701499\nError fetching https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.042701499: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.042701499'\n\n# Content from https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/11867720\/\n# Regulation of transferrin-mediated iron uptake by HFE, the protein defective in hereditary hemochromatosis\n\n-\nPMID:\n**11867720** - PMCID: PMC122482\n- DOI: 10.1073\/pnas.042701499\n\n# Regulation of transferrin-mediated iron uptake by HFE, the protein defective in hereditary hemochromatosis\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe protein defective in hereditary hemochromatosis, called HFE, is similar to MHC class I-type proteins and associates with beta2-microglobulin (beta2M). Its association with beta2M was previously shown to be necessary for its stability, normal intracellular processing, and cell surface expression in transfected COS cells. Here we use stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing both HFE and beta2M or HFE alone to study the effects of beta2M on the stability and maturation of the HFE protein and on the role of HFE in transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)-mediated iron uptake. In agreement with prior studies on other cell lines, we found that overexpression of HFE, without overexpressing beta2M, resulted in a decrease in TfR1dependent iron uptake and in lower iron levels in the cells, as evidenced by ferritin and TfR1 levels measured at steady state. However, overexpression of both HFE and beta2M had the reverse effect and resulted in an increase in TfR1-dependent iron uptake and increased iron levels in the cells. The HFE-beta2M complex did not affect the affinity of TfR1 for transferrin or the internalization rate of transferrin-bound TfR1. Instead, HFE-beta2M enhanced the rate of recycling of TfR1 and resulted in an increase in the steady-state level of TfR1 at the cell surface of stably transfected cells. We propose that Chinese hamster ovary cells provide a model to explain the effect of the HFE-beta2M complex in duodenal crypt cells, where the HFE-beta2M complex appears to facilitate the uptake of transferrin-bound iron to sense the level of body iron stores. Impairment of this process in duodenal crypt cells leads them to be iron poor and to signal the differentiating enterocytes to take up iron excessively after they mature into villus cells in the duodenum of hereditary hemochromatosis patients.\n\n## Figures\n\n## References\n\n-\n- Cartwright G E, Edwards C Q, Kravitz K, Skolnick M, Amos D B, Johnson A, Buskjaer L.

The HFE protein interacts with other proteins on the cell surface to detect the amount of iron in the body.\nQ: When to check HFE gene?\nA: Testing for gene changes. Testing DNA for changes in the HFE gene is recommended if there are high levels of iron in the blood. If you're considering genetic testing for hemochromatosis, discuss the reasons for and against with your healthcare professional or a genetic counselor.\nQ: Who is most likely to get hereditary hemochromatosis?\nA: People at risk Hereditary hemochromatosis is most common among people with Northern European ancestry. Men with hereditary hemochromatosis are more likely to develop complications than women, and men are often diagnosed at an earlier age.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_yMINkx3ADD3gmJWrgWHKjmyg\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Intracellular signaling pathways in stellate cell activation\\\\\\\" Britton Bacon 1999 authors 'Intracellular signaling pathways in stellate cell activation' Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1999 23 922-925 authors 'Britton RS' 'Bacon BR'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Apoptosis of rat hepatic stellate cells induced by anti-focal ...\nURL: https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC4656330\/\nby XJ Liu \u00b7 2002 \u00b7 Cited by 34 \u2014 Britton RS, Bacon BR.

The story of patients dying unnecessarily in this way had a powerful effect on the public. Numerous (often sensationalistic) accounts in the lay media across the country speculated on possible causes of the errors, publicly chastised the pharmacy technicians and other professionals involved, and called into question the safety of all of Canada's healthcare institutions. As a result of these events, an independent inquiry of the incident was conducted, a new patient safety position was created for the region,1 a review of best practices was commissioned, and many changes were made to ensure \u201cthis would never happen again.\u201d Often it is the public response to a story about an adverse event or medical error that drives changes in practice, rather than careful attention to the available evidence.2\n\nSince the publication of the Institute of Medicine's report, *To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health Care System*,3 the safety of medications, and of patients in general, has caught the attention of the general public and hospital healthcare practitioners. This report identified medication errors as the single largest cause of medical errors in hospitals, accounting for some 7000 deaths each year in the United States. Another report estimated that more than one million medication errors occur every year in US hospitals,4 and about 5% of all admissions to hospital are related to adverse drug events.5 Since the report, most safety research has focused on measuring the incidence of adverse events, including medication errors, rather than evaluating the effectiveness of current or proposed safety practices relating to medication and patients. The use of potassium supplements and safe handling of potassium are examples of the kind of practice affecting the safety of patients that is common and ought to be improved through the rigorous application of evidence based practices. Surveillance systems in US hospitals report that potassium chloride concentrate is the drug most often implicated in fatal incidents.6\n\nWe conducted a qualitative systematic review of the literature evaluating best practices for handling products containing potassium in hospital settings, at all stages of the process by which medications are used, to help frontline personnel improve patients' safety in the hospital setting. We identified and summarised the evidence supporting practices for handling products containing potassium safely, to provide policy makers and healthcare practitioners with guidance to facilitate best practice.\n\n**Summary points**\n\nRecommendations for improved patients' safety, specifically the safety of products containing potassium, are often based on practice guidelines and untested recommendations widely endorsed by various experts or organisations\n\nValid and empirical evidence to support or discourage implementation of even the most widely identified potassium safety practices is completely lacking\n\nResearch aimed at evaluating healthcare systems as a whole, accompanied by implementation of effective evidence based medication safety practices, is essential and urgently needed\n\n## Methods\n\nWe searched the reference lists of major reviews already completed on the safety of medication and known bibliographies relevant to patients' safety and medication error. We supplemented this by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2nd quarter 2004), Medline (1966 to May 2004, week 4), Embase (1988 to 2004, week 22), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to May 2004). We used broad search terms to ensure that we identified all studies related to the safe use of potassium. Searches were not limited to specific study designs, to allow us to identify research encompassing all levels of evidence. We examined the reference lists of all related articles for relevant studies. We considered only English language reports.\n\nWe also examined sources of relevant grey literature for information about medication safety. We searched the internet to identify pertinent government agencies and non-governmental organisations, special interest groups or lobby groups, accreditation agencies, key informants, and other websites of interest. We contacted key informants from these organisations.\n\nIn recognition of the current early state of literature about the safety of patients and medications and the importance of practices that are relevant to existing systems, we systematically searched for publications that would provide a comprehensive set of best practice information across a continuum of evidence. We did not include reports that were simply descriptive in nature or that lacked any supporting evidence. We examined the entire medication process, from production in the pharmaceutical companies to direct administration of drugs to patients, to identify potential interventions. Although each stage of the medication process offers opportunities for improving patients' safety, the primary focus of this review is on those interventions that are directly applicable to the administration of potassium.\n\n## Results\n\nOf the 2533 citations identified in the literature search, we retrieved 238 that seemed potentially relevant. We excluded all from this analysis because they were case reports, anecdotal papers, or opinion papers. We did not find a single study that evaluated the effectiveness of any of the practices routinely recommended for the safe use of products containing potassium, nor for the use of analysis of healthcare systems, including organisational culture and structure, in medication safety. The literature discussing the safety of potassium consists largely of case reports of errors resulting from the improper use of potassium, and expert recommendations for preventing these case specific errors. These recommendations are not based on evidence on the relative effectiveness of various corrective practice options but rather on expert consensus, the experience of various hospitals that have implemented specific practices, and practices endorsed by well respected patient safety and medication safety organisations. These organisations, found largely in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, provide support, expertise, and resources for improving the safety of medications. Box 1 shows the spectrum of recommendations for potassium safety that we found, not as an endorsement of any particular practice, but to illustrate the broad scope of practices commonly implemented\u2014practices that, as far as we were able to ascertain, have no evidence basis indicating they might actually reduce harm.\n\n### Removing potassium chloride from clinical areas\n\nThe single most often suggested strategy for reducing medication errors involving potassium chloride is to remove all stocks of concentrated potassium chloride from clinical areas. Rather than being based on specific research studies that have determined the efficacy of this, and other, recommendations, this suggestion is based on forcing function concepts (whereby the system is designed to force healthcare professionals to act in a certain way, preventing adverse events) drawn from research literature into human factors. Although safety organisations strongly recommend removing concentrated potassium chloride from wards, many hospitals continue to stock this medication in clinical areas. A 1997 survey of US hospitals determined that concentrated potassium chloride was kept in 59.4% of all emergency departments and 71.9% of all intensive care units.6 The same survey indicated that the primary reason that hospital staff found it necessary to maintain stocks of potassium chloride in these departments was because patients requiring this medication often need it very quickly, and any delay in administering it could severely compromise patients' care. In addition, many hospital pharmacies have limited hours of operation, necessitating storage of potassium chloride in clinical areas. For this reason, several agencies specify that stocks of potassium chloride can remain in critical care areas, but care must be taken to avoid transferring ampoules between clinical areas.6,7 In addition, it is often recommended that when potassium chloride must be kept on the wards it should be kept in a locked cupboard, separate from all other solutions.6-8 Proper protocols should be developed to monitor the removal, use, and restocking of potassium chloride, including the checking of drug use against prescription orders, and to reduce unauthorised transfer of drugs across clinical departments.9\n\n### Packaging and preparation of potassium chloride\n\nMistakes are often made during the preparation of dilute solutions containing potassium. Similar packaging to other solutions, storage of potassium chloride in close proximity to other solutions, and a lack of effective independent double checking have all contributed to medication errors involving potassium chloride.10 For this reason, commercially prepared dilute solutions are often recommended.6,8,11 Some literature on safe medication recommends that healthcare providers should prescribe potassium solutions in standardised concentrations, available as commercially prepared products.7 However, when premixed solutions are not feasible, required dilutions should be made only in the pharmacy and never in clinical areas.12 It is recommended that in the pharmacy, efforts should be made to ensure potassium products are easily distinguishable from similar products.8,9,13 This can be accomplished by having a separate storage area for products containing concentrated potassium and adding auxiliary fluorescent warning labels to both concentrated potassium chloride and diluted intravenous solutions.13 In addition, some hospitals purchase concentrated potassium solutions from a different vendor from the one they use to supply dilute solutions to avoid errors caused by packaging similarities.14\n\n**Box 1: Recommendations for safe handling of potassium products**\n\n**Drug storage**\n\nRemove concentrated potassium chloride from clinical areas\n\nStore potassium products in locked cupboards in clinical areas\n\nEliminate the transfer of potassium products between wards and other clinical areas\n\n\n**Drug preparation**\n\nHave pre-prepared intravenous infusion available that contains potassium\n\nPrepare needed infusions in the pharmacy\n\n\n**Drug packaging**\n\n\u2022 Ensure ampoules of potassium chloride are distinguishable from other injectable preparations\n\n**Prescribing**\n\nPrescribe potassium chloride in concentrations available as ready made infusions\n\nAvoid \u201cincomplete\u201d and illegible prescribing\n\nPrescribe oral potassium chloride to treat hypokalaemia when clinically feasible\n\n\n**Drug administration**\n\nDevelop clear therapeutic guidelines defining the maximum concentration of potassium in an intravenous solution\n\nDevelop clear therapeutic guidelines defining infusion rates for the administration of intravenous potassium\n\nInstitute a double check policy\n\nEnsure safe use of infusion pumps\n\n\n**Pharmaceutical industry standards**\n\n\u2022 Encourage distinct, standardised labelling and packaging as an industry standard\n\n### Development of guidelines for appropriate administration\n\nMany people recommend that therapeutic guidelines be developed for the administration of potassium chloride13 and once developed, continuous training of healthcare staff should be implemented to ensure these guidelines are understood and implemented. The Safety and Quality Council of Australia has summarised the recommended components of potassium chloride guidelines (box 2).9\n\nMost medication errors occur at the prescribing and administration level.15,16 For this reason, clear guidelines should be developed to ensure that safe prescribing practices are used for products containing potassium. Common recommendations include ensuring that all prescriptions include instructions for dilution and infusion rates, and avoiding the term \u201cbolus\u201d for intravenous orders.9 In terms of administering products containing potassium, the universal recommendation is to develop double check policies (similar to those used for blood transfusion) for every step in the process of administering medications. For example, it is often suggested that two healthcare providers always check for the correct product, dose, dilution, labelling, route, and rate before administering any medication, to ensure it complies with the therapeutic guidelines.9\n\n**Box 2: Recommendations for guidelines for administration of potassium chloride**\n\nOral potassium should be used to treat hypokalaemia when clinically feasible\n\nPrescribing should be standardised to ensure all intravenous potassium chloride is ordered in millimoles (mmol)\n\nPrescribing should be standardised, and premixed solution should be encouraged\n\nClear definitions should be developed to indicate the maximum concentration of potassium chloride in an intravenous solution\n\nThe maximum hourly rate and daily limits that a patient may receive, in addition to infusion rates and infusion pump requirements, should be specified\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIt is not, perhaps, surprising to find a complete lack of valid evidence to support or discourage implementation of even the most widely recommended, identified practices for administering medication safely, with respect to the safe administration of potassium. However, considerable debate surrounding the current state of the science occurs in the literature on patients' safety and a recurrent theme consistently emerges: what role (if any) does evidence have in medication safety?\n\nIn response to the medical error data published in *To Err is Human*,3 the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned the University of California, San Francisco-Stanford University Evidence-Based Practice Center to produce a report summarising the literature surrounding practices relevant to improving patients' safety. This landmark report, *Making Health Care Safer: A Critical Analysis of Patient Safety Practices,* contains summaries of the evidence supporting 83 safety practices.17 Only six of these practices concern medication safety,18 and none of them deals with practices specifically relating to the safe administration of products containing potassium. This report generated controversy in the literature on patients' safety, largely because most of the practices advocated by leading patient safety agencies were not tackled nor even considered. In addition, this report sparked new interest in the continuing debate surrounding the principles of evidence based medicine and its role in patients' safety.\n\n### Safety practices\n\nMany leading medication safety experts and agencies believe that the safety of medications, indeed of patients in general, is primarily a \u201csystems\u201d issue. Unfortunately, this hypothesis has not been tested rigorously, and it is often claimed that changes to systems are not as easily evaluated as specific, individual practices and technologies. In addition, several practices that are widely endorsed were not mentioned in the report of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality but are nevertheless directly relevant to the safe handling of potassium. These include19:\n\nInstituting pharmacy based intravenous admixture systems\n\nRemoving concentrated potassium chloride vials from areas where patients are being cared for and stocking premixed solutions on wards\n\nDeveloping special procedures for high risk drugs by using a multidisciplinary approach (written guidelines, checklists, preprinted orders, double checks, special packaging, special labelling)\n\nProviding doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and all other clinicians involved in the medication process with education on ordering, dispensing, administering, and monitoring medications\n\nHaving a pharmacist available on call after hours of pharmacy operation.\n\n\nMany of these practices reflect the basic tenets of the systems based approach, such as building in system redundancies (\u201cdouble checks\u201d), reducing options, and standardising or simplifying processes.7\n\nInvestigations of fatalities and injuries caused by the misuse of potassium need to take into account the full range of systems based factors that might affect the safety of medications, including the priority and resources given to patients' safety in general. Furthermore, to reduce the incidence of potassium related (and other medications) errors\u2014many of which are preventable\u2014effectively, hospitals must go beyond investigating individual incidents and focus more on identifying and implementing effective, systems based improvements that are grounded in evidence of reasonable quality.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThis systematic review highlights the lack of strong evidence in support of specific best practice initiatives related to the safe handling of potassium containing products. The quality and quantity of evidence in support of best practices related to other patient safety issues is likely in a similar state. If the aim is to identify and implement the most effective medication safety practices, then systems oriented evaluation research accompanied by implementation of evidence based medication safety practices is essential. The need is especially urgent given our main finding that no valid studies evaluate the effectiveness of any of the practices currently recommended for the safe handling of products containing potassium.\n\n**Additional educational resources**\n\n*Making health care safer: a critical analysis of patient safety practices* (www.ahrq.gov\/clinic\/ptsafety\/)\u2014The report of an evidence based project, funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, that collected and critically reviewed the existing evidence on practices relevant to improving the safety of patients, including medication safety (primarily pertaining to heparin and warfarin)\n\nNational Patient Safety Agency (www.npsa.nhs.uk)\u2014This UK agency aims to foster a culture in which errors in the NHS healthcare system can be investigated and innovative solutions developed.

This report identified medication errors as the single largest cause of medical errors in hospitals, accounting for some 7000 deaths each year in the United States. Another report estimated that more than one million medication errors occur every year in US hospitals,4 and about 5% of all admissions to hospital are related to adverse drug events.5 Since the report, most safety research has focused on measuring the incidence of adverse events, including medication errors, rather than evaluating the effectiveness of current or proposed safety practices relating to medication and patients. The use of potassium supplements and safe handling of potassium are examples of the kind of practice affecting the safety of patients that is common and ought to be improved through the rigorous application of evidence based practices. Surveillance systems in US hospitals report that potassium chloride concentrate is the drug most often implicated in fatal incidents.6\n\nWe conducted a qualitative systematic review of the literature evaluating best practices for handling products containing potassium in hospital settings, at all stages of the process by which medications are used, to help frontline personnel improve patients' safety in the hospital setting. We identified and summarised the evidence supporting practices for handling products containing potassium safely, to provide policy makers and healthcare practitioners with guidance to facilitate best practice.\n\n**Summary points**\n\nRecommendations for improved patients' safety, specifically the safety of products containing potassium, are often based on practice guidelines and untested recommendations widely endorsed by various experts or organisations\n\nValid and empirical evidence to support or discourage implementation of even the most widely identified potassium safety practices is completely lacking\n\nResearch aimed at evaluating healthcare systems as a whole, accompanied by implementation of effective evidence based medication safety practices, is essential and urgently needed\n\n## Methods\n\nWe searched the reference lists of major reviews already completed on the safety of medication and known bibliographies relevant to patients' safety and medication error. We supplemented this by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2nd quarter 2004), Medline (1966 to May 2004, week 4), Embase (1988 to 2004, week 22), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to May 2004). We used broad search terms to ensure that we identified all studies related to the safe use of potassium. Searches were not limited to specific study designs, to allow us to identify research encompassing all levels of evidence. We examined the reference lists of all related articles for relevant studies. We considered only English language reports.\n\nWe also examined sources of relevant grey literature for information about medication safety. We searched the internet to identify pertinent government agencies and non-governmental organisations, special interest groups or lobby groups, accreditation agencies, key informants, and other websites of interest. We contacted key informants from these organisations.\n\nIn recognition of the current early state of literature about the safety of patients and medications and the importance of practices that are relevant to existing systems, we systematically searched for publications that would provide a comprehensive set of best practice information across a continuum of evidence. We did not include reports that were simply descriptive in nature or that lacked any supporting evidence. We examined the entire medication process, from production in the pharmaceutical companies to direct administration of drugs to patients, to identify potential interventions. Although each stage of the medication process offers opportunities for improving patients' safety, the primary focus of this review is on those interventions that are directly applicable to the administration of potassium.\n\n## Results\n\nOf the 2533 citations identified in the literature search, we retrieved 238 that seemed potentially relevant. We excluded all from this analysis because they were case reports, anecdotal papers, or opinion papers. We did not find a single study that evaluated the effectiveness of any of the practices routinely recommended for the safe use of products containing potassium, nor for the use of analysis of healthcare systems, including organisational culture and structure, in medication safety. The literature discussing the safety of potassium consists largely of case reports of errors resulting from the improper use of potassium, and expert recommendations for preventing these case specific errors. These recommendations are not based on evidence on the relative effectiveness of various corrective practice options but rather on expert consensus, the experience of various hospitals that have implemented specific practices, and practices endorsed by well respected patient safety and medication safety organisations. These organisations, found largely in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, provide support, expertise, and resources for improving the safety of medications. Box 1 shows the spectrum of recommendations for potassium safety that we found, not as an endorsement of any particular practice, but to illustrate the broad scope of practices commonly implemented\u2014practices that, as far as we were able to ascertain, have no evidence basis indicating they might actually reduce harm.\n\n### Removing potassium chloride from clinical areas\n\nThe single most often suggested strategy for reducing medication errors involving potassium chloride is to remove all stocks of concentrated potassium chloride from clinical areas. Rather than being based on specific research studies that have determined the efficacy of this, and other, recommendations, this suggestion is based on forcing function concepts (whereby the system is designed to force healthcare professionals to act in a certain way, preventing adverse events) drawn from research literature into human factors. Although safety organisations strongly recommend removing concentrated potassium chloride from wards, many hospitals continue to stock this medication in clinical areas. A 1997 survey of US hospitals determined that concentrated potassium chloride was kept in 59.4% of all emergency departments and 71.9% of all intensive care units.6 The same survey indicated that the primary reason that hospital staff found it necessary to maintain stocks of potassium chloride in these departments was because patients requiring this medication often need it very quickly, and any delay in administering it could severely compromise patients' care. In addition, many hospital pharmacies have limited hours of operation, necessitating storage of potassium chloride in clinical areas. For this reason, several agencies specify that stocks of potassium chloride can remain in critical care areas, but care must be taken to avoid transferring ampoules between clinical areas.6,7 In addition, it is often recommended that when potassium chloride must be kept on the wards it should be kept in a locked cupboard, separate from all other solutions.6-8 Proper protocols should be developed to monitor the removal, use, and restocking of potassium chloride, including the checking of drug use against prescription orders, and to reduce unauthorised transfer of drugs across clinical departments.9\n\n### Packaging and preparation of potassium chloride\n\nMistakes are often made during the preparation of dilute solutions containing potassium. Similar packaging to other solutions, storage of potassium chloride in close proximity to other solutions, and a lack of effective independent double checking have all contributed to medication errors involving potassium chloride.10 For this reason, commercially prepared dilute solutions are often recommended.6,8,11 Some literature on safe medication recommends that healthcare providers should prescribe potassium solutions in standardised concentrations, available as commercially prepared products.7 However, when premixed solutions are not feasible, required dilutions should be made only in the pharmacy and never in clinical areas.12 It is recommended that in the pharmacy, efforts should be made to ensure potassium products are easily distinguishable from similar products.8,9,13 This can be accomplished by having a separate storage area for products containing concentrated potassium and adding auxiliary fluorescent warning labels to both concentrated potassium chloride and diluted intravenous solutions.13 In addition, some hospitals purchase concentrated potassium solutions from a different vendor from the one they use to supply dilute solutions to avoid errors caused by packaging similarities.14\n\n**Box 1: Recommendations for safe handling of potassium products**\n\n**Drug storage**\n\nRemove concentrated potassium chloride from clinical areas\n\nStore potassium products in locked cupboards in clinical areas\n\nEliminate the transfer of potassium products between wards and other clinical areas\n\n\n**Drug preparation**\n\nHave pre-prepared intravenous infusion available that contains potassium\n\nPrepare needed infusions in the pharmacy\n\n\n**Drug packaging**\n\n\u2022 Ensure ampoules of potassium chloride are distinguishable from other injectable preparations\n\n**Prescribing**\n\nPrescribe potassium chloride in concentrations available as ready made infusions\n\nAvoid \u201cincomplete\u201d and illegible prescribing\n\nPrescribe oral potassium chloride to treat hypokalaemia when clinically feasible\n\n\n**Drug administration**\n\nDevelop clear therapeutic guidelines defining the maximum concentration of potassium in an intravenous solution\n\nDevelop clear therapeutic guidelines defining infusion rates for the administration of intravenous potassium\n\nInstitute a double check policy\n\nEnsure safe use of infusion pumps\n\n\n**Pharmaceutical industry standards**\n\n\u2022 Encourage distinct, standardised labelling and packaging as an industry standard\n\n### Development of guidelines for appropriate administration\n\nMany people recommend that therapeutic guidelines be developed for the administration of potassium chloride13 and once developed, continuous training of healthcare staff should be implemented to ensure these guidelines are understood and implemented. The Safety and Quality Council of Australia has summarised the recommended components of potassium chloride guidelines (box 2).9\n\nMost medication errors occur at the prescribing and administration level.15,16 For this reason, clear guidelines should be developed to ensure that safe prescribing practices are used for products containing potassium. Common recommendations include ensuring that all prescriptions include instructions for dilution and infusion rates, and avoiding the term \u201cbolus\u201d for intravenous orders.9 In terms of administering products containing potassium, the universal recommendation is to develop double check policies (similar to those used for blood transfusion) for every step in the process of administering medications. For example, it is often suggested that two healthcare providers always check for the correct product, dose, dilution, labelling, route, and rate before administering any medication, to ensure it complies with the therapeutic guidelines.9\n\n**Box 2: Recommendations for guidelines for administration of potassium chloride**\n\nOral potassium should be used to treat hypokalaemia when clinically feasible\n\nPrescribing should be standardised to ensure all intravenous potassium chloride is ordered in millimoles (mmol)\n\nPrescribing should be standardised, and premixed solution should be encouraged\n\nClear definitions should be developed to indicate the maximum concentration of potassium chloride in an intravenous solution\n\nThe maximum hourly rate and daily limits that a patient may receive, in addition to infusion rates and infusion pump requirements, should be specified\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIt is not, perhaps, surprising to find a complete lack of valid evidence to support or discourage implementation of even the most widely recommended, identified practices for administering medication safely, with respect to the safe administration of potassium. However, considerable debate surrounding the current state of the science occurs in the literature on patients' safety and a recurrent theme consistently emerges: what role (if any) does evidence have in medication safety?\n\nIn response to the medical error data published in *To Err is Human*,3 the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned the University of California, San Francisco-Stanford University Evidence-Based Practice Center to produce a report summarising the literature surrounding practices relevant to improving patients' safety. This landmark report, *Making Health Care Safer: A Critical Analysis of Patient Safety Practices,* contains summaries of the evidence supporting 83 safety practices.17 Only six of these practices concern medication safety,18 and none of them deals with practices specifically relating to the safe administration of products containing potassium. This report generated controversy in the literature on patients' safety, largely because most of the practices advocated by leading patient safety agencies were not tackled nor even considered. In addition, this report sparked new interest in the continuing debate surrounding the principles of evidence based medicine and its role in patients' safety.\n\n### Safety practices\n\nMany leading medication safety experts and agencies believe that the safety of medications, indeed of patients in general, is primarily a \u201csystems\u201d issue. Unfortunately, this hypothesis has not been tested rigorously, and it is often claimed that changes to systems are not as easily evaluated as specific, individual practices and technologies. In addition, several practices that are widely endorsed were not mentioned in the report of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality but are nevertheless directly relevant to the safe handling of potassium. These include19:\n\nInstituting pharmacy based intravenous admixture systems\n\nRemoving concentrated potassium chloride vials from areas where patients are being cared for and stocking premixed solutions on wards\n\nDeveloping special procedures for high risk drugs by using a multidisciplinary approach (written guidelines, checklists, preprinted orders, double checks, special packaging, special labelling)\n\nProviding doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and all other clinicians involved in the medication process with education on ordering, dispensing, administering, and monitoring medications\n\nHaving a pharmacist available on call after hours of pharmacy operation.\n\n\nMany of these practices reflect the basic tenets of the systems based approach, such as building in system redundancies (\u201cdouble checks\u201d), reducing options, and standardising or simplifying processes.7\n\nInvestigations of fatalities and injuries caused by the misuse of potassium need to take into account the full range of systems based factors that might affect the safety of medications, including the priority and resources given to patients' safety in general. Furthermore, to reduce the incidence of potassium related (and other medications) errors\u2014many of which are preventable\u2014effectively, hospitals must go beyond investigating individual incidents and focus more on identifying and implementing effective, systems based improvements that are grounded in evidence of reasonable quality.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThis systematic review highlights the lack of strong evidence in support of specific best practice initiatives related to the safe handling of potassium containing products. The quality and quantity of evidence in support of best practices related to other patient safety issues is likely in a similar state. If the aim is to identify and implement the most effective medication safety practices, then systems oriented evaluation research accompanied by implementation of evidence based medication safety practices is essential. The need is especially urgent given our main finding that no valid studies evaluate the effectiveness of any of the practices currently recommended for the safe handling of products containing potassium.\n\n**Additional educational resources**\n\n*Making health care safer: a critical analysis of patient safety practices* (www.ahrq.gov\/clinic\/ptsafety\/)\u2014The report of an evidence based project, funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, that collected and critically reviewed the existing evidence on practices relevant to improving the safety of patients, including medication safety (primarily pertaining to heparin and warfarin)\n\nNational Patient Safety Agency (www.npsa.nhs.uk)\u2014This UK agency aims to foster a culture in which errors in the NHS healthcare system can be investigated and innovative solutions developed.

The Safety and Quality Council of Australia has summarised the recommended components of potassium chloride guidelines (box 2).9\n\nMost medication errors occur at the prescribing and administration level.15,16 For this reason, clear guidelines should be developed to ensure that safe prescribing practices are used for products containing potassium. Common recommendations include ensuring that all prescriptions include instructions for dilution and infusion rates, and avoiding the term \u201cbolus\u201d for intravenous orders.9 In terms of administering products containing potassium, the universal recommendation is to develop double check policies (similar to those used for blood transfusion) for every step in the process of administering medications. For example, it is often suggested that two healthcare providers always check for the correct product, dose, dilution, labelling, route, and rate before administering any medication, to ensure it complies with the therapeutic guidelines.9\n\n**Box 2: Recommendations for guidelines for administration of potassium chloride**\n\nOral potassium should be used to treat hypokalaemia when clinically feasible\n\nPrescribing should be standardised to ensure all intravenous potassium chloride is ordered in millimoles (mmol)\n\nPrescribing should be standardised, and premixed solution should be encouraged\n\nClear definitions should be developed to indicate the maximum concentration of potassium chloride in an intravenous solution\n\nThe maximum hourly rate and daily limits that a patient may receive, in addition to infusion rates and infusion pump requirements, should be specified\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIt is not, perhaps, surprising to find a complete lack of valid evidence to support or discourage implementation of even the most widely recommended, identified practices for administering medication safely, with respect to the safe administration of potassium. However, considerable debate surrounding the current state of the science occurs in the literature on patients' safety and a recurrent theme consistently emerges: what role (if any) does evidence have in medication safety?\n\nIn response to the medical error data published in *To Err is Human*,3 the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned the University of California, San Francisco-Stanford University Evidence-Based Practice Center to produce a report summarising the literature surrounding practices relevant to improving patients' safety. This landmark report, *Making Health Care Safer: A Critical Analysis of Patient Safety Practices,* contains summaries of the evidence supporting 83 safety practices.17 Only six of these practices concern medication safety,18 and none of them deals with practices specifically relating to the safe administration of products containing potassium. This report generated controversy in the literature on patients' safety, largely because most of the practices advocated by leading patient safety agencies were not tackled nor even considered. In addition, this report sparked new interest in the continuing debate surrounding the principles of evidence based medicine and its role in patients' safety.\n\n### Safety practices\n\nMany leading medication safety experts and agencies believe that the safety of medications, indeed of patients in general, is primarily a \u201csystems\u201d issue. Unfortunately, this hypothesis has not been tested rigorously, and it is often claimed that changes to systems are not as easily evaluated as specific, individual practices and technologies. In addition, several practices that are widely endorsed were not mentioned in the report of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality but are nevertheless directly relevant to the safe handling of potassium. These include19:\n\nInstituting pharmacy based intravenous admixture systems\n\nRemoving concentrated potassium chloride vials from areas where patients are being cared for and stocking premixed solutions on wards\n\nDeveloping special procedures for high risk drugs by using a multidisciplinary approach (written guidelines, checklists, preprinted orders, double checks, special packaging, special labelling)\n\nProviding doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and all other clinicians involved in the medication process with education on ordering, dispensing, administering, and monitoring medications\n\nHaving a pharmacist available on call after hours of pharmacy operation.\n\n\nMany of these practices reflect the basic tenets of the systems based approach, such as building in system redundancies (\u201cdouble checks\u201d), reducing options, and standardising or simplifying processes.7\n\nInvestigations of fatalities and injuries caused by the misuse of potassium need to take into account the full range of systems based factors that might affect the safety of medications, including the priority and resources given to patients' safety in general. Furthermore, to reduce the incidence of potassium related (and other medications) errors\u2014many of which are preventable\u2014effectively, hospitals must go beyond investigating individual incidents and focus more on identifying and implementing effective, systems based improvements that are grounded in evidence of reasonable quality.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThis systematic review highlights the lack of strong evidence in support of specific best practice initiatives related to the safe handling of potassium containing products. The quality and quantity of evidence in support of best practices related to other patient safety issues is likely in a similar state. If the aim is to identify and implement the most effective medication safety practices, then systems oriented evaluation research accompanied by implementation of evidence based medication safety practices is essential. The need is especially urgent given our main finding that no valid studies evaluate the effectiveness of any of the practices currently recommended for the safe handling of products containing potassium.\n\n**Additional educational resources**\n\n*Making health care safer: a critical analysis of patient safety practices* (www.ahrq.gov\/clinic\/ptsafety\/)\u2014The report of an evidence based project, funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, that collected and critically reviewed the existing evidence on practices relevant to improving the safety of patients, including medication safety (primarily pertaining to heparin and warfarin)\n\nNational Patient Safety Agency (www.npsa.nhs.uk)\u2014This UK agency aims to foster a culture in which errors in the NHS healthcare system can be investigated and innovative solutions developed.

He is a professor in pediatrics and child health, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences. He is also CEO and Scientific Director of the Children\u2019s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba and the Academic Director of the George & Fey Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation. He was awarded a prestigious Tier 1 CRC, which comes with $1.4 million in funding over seven years, from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. *UM Today *caught up with him to learn a bit about him and the research he is undertaking.\n\n**Tell us about your research. **\n\nMy research is centered on testing new treatments and approaches to improving the outcomes of children and their families. I use the randomized controlled trial as the most powerful tool to give trustworthy results. My clinical area is pediatric emergency medicine and so much of my research focuses on new treatments in this area. COVID-19 is demonstrating the key importance of clinical trials in both determining effective new treatments and whether the vaccines are safe and effective.\n\n**Tell us a bit about yourself. **\n\nI did medical school and my pediatric residency at UM. After that my academic career as a clinician scientist in pediatric emergency medicine developed in Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario\/University of Ottawa and Stollery Children\u2019s Hospital\/University of Alberta. I was recruited back to UM in 2010 to assume the leadership of Children\u2019s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba.\n\nDoing large network clinical trials, UM has a strategic advantage in being located in the middle of the country. The George and Fay Centre for Healthcare Innovation, one of the CIHR SUPPORT Units, has been great infrastructure to develop clinical trials and has some really excellent clinical trialists. Dr. Ryan Zarychanski has been an international leader in COVID-19 trials to discover effective and safe treatments.\n\n**What does CRC funding mean to you as a researcher? **\n\nMy CRC in Clinical Trials will allow us to build a strong basis to do innovative randomized controlled trials. We will be able to develop strength in Bayesian analyses for randomized controlled trials. We would like to train the next generation of clinical trialists.\n\n**How did you feel when you learned you were awarded your Canada Research Chair?**\n\nI was absolutely delighted to learn I was awarded my CRC. It was truly one of the most exciting moments in my life. It was great to share a celebratory moment with my family and friends.\n\n**What inspires you? **\n\nConducting randomized controlled trials in pediatric emergency medicine is motivating as there are times where my grandkids do visit the emergency department with a fracture. Some of the trials we are doing will advance the care we provide children with a fracture. The ability to do something that will make it better for one\u2019s grandkids is inspiring.\n\nDr. Marilyn Li in Ottawa inspired me to go into Pediatric Emergency Medicine. She helped me do my first randomized controlled trial in bronchiolitis. Later Dr.Ian Chalmers, founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, has been an amazing person to look up to. His commitment to doing the best clinical research based on patients\u2019 needs is remarkable.\n\n**What about you would people find surprising?**\n\nPeople may find it surprising that I spent my childhood in Belize. My dad helped run some primary schools there and founded a high school that is still in operation. I went there for one year before we returned to Canada to finish my high school. My childhood has given me a very rich view of life and very supportive of diversity and inclusion.\n\n**Do you have any advice for students\/young grad students starting their career?**\n\nFocus on asking interesting questions in a very supportive environment \u2013 using the best methodology available \u2013 that is innovative and cutting edge.\n\n\n*Research at the University of Manitoba is partially supported by funding from the Government of Canada Research Support Fund.*\n\n# Content from https:\/\/enrichyourscience.ca\/comitees\/terry-klassen\/\nSkip to content\nSearch\nAbout Us\nPrograms\nRISE LMS\nEnrichment Program & Awards\nEvents\nIllumination Program\nCurriculum\nNetwork\nWho we are\nCommittees\nLearners\nGovernance\nMentors\nSupporters and Partners\nRegional Leaders\nEnrichment Groups\nIllumination Program\nContact Us\nAnnual Symposium\nAbout Us\nPrograms\nRISE LMS\nEnrichment Program & Awards\nEvents\nIllumination Program\nCurriculum\nNetwork\nWho we are\nCommittees\nLearners\nGovernance\nMentors\nSupporters and Partners\nRegional Leaders\nEnrichment Groups\nIllumination Program\nContact Us\nAnnual Symposium\nTerry\nKlassen\nIncreasing Capacity for Maternal and Paediatric Clinical Trials Chair\n,\nMentorship Committee\nBiography\nDr. Terry Klassen is a highly regarded clinician scientist in pediatric emergency medicine who has had a highly successful academic leadership career in a variety of areas. Dr. Klassen is well known for excellence in clinical trials, as well as knowledge synthesis and translation. He is the co-founder of Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) and Scientific Director of Translating Emergency Knowledge for Kids (TREKK), a Network of Centres of Excellence in Knowledge Mobilization initiative. Through TREKK and PERC, Dr. Klassen was able to create and disseminate knowledge that has resulted in fewer hospital admissions for children with croup. Dr. Klassen has a strong vision to align pediatric research efforts across the country. In recognition of his lifetime contributions, he was inducted into the National Academy of Medicine in 2010 in the foreign associate category. He is also a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences. His research has had a large impact on the practice of pediatric emergency medicine, which was recognized when he received a 2011 Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) \u2013 Canadian Medical Association Journal Top Achievements in Health Research Award.

Here, performing with the Prep Players, he gained his first theatrical experience. At Marquette University, he participated in the Marquette University Players. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1960, he decided to seek a career in theater, starting in New York City in improv with a troupe called The Premise. After compulsory service as a draftee in the United States Army, he worked with an improv troupe in San Francisco known as The Committee, whose members included Rob Reiner, David Ogden Stiers, Howard Hesseman and Hamilton Camp.[4]\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]Bonerz's first network television appearance was in 1965 on *The Addams Family* in the season-two episode \"Morticia, The Writer\".[5] He had several more TV appearances in the late 1960s and also had roles in several films, including *Funnyman* (1967); *What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?* (1969); *Medium Cool* (1969); *Catch-22* (1970), which also included his future co-star Bob Newhart; *Jennifer on My Mind* (1971); and *Fuzz* (1972). In 1971, Bonerz was part of an ensemble cast in the short-lived improvisational television show *Story Theatre*, which also included Alan Alda and Valerie Harper. In 1972, he landed the popular supporting role of Dr. Jerry Robinson, the eccentric orthodontist on *The Bob Newhart Show*, whose most frequent comic foil was Marcia Wallace as Carol, the sharp-tongued receptionist. Bonerz would reprise this role in a cameo appearance in the final, unaired episode of Bob Newhart's third series, *Bob*.[6] He also directed 29 episodes. The show ran for six seasons, with ratings among the top 20 in the first three seasons. Bonerz became the last surviving main cast member upon the death of Bob Newhart in 2024.\n\nHis later acting roles included the TV miniseries *The Bastard* (1978) and as a psychiatrist in the movie *Serial* (1980). In 1979, Bonerz appeared on *Password Plus* as a game show contestant\/celebrity guest star with Marcia Wallace, his costar from *The Bob Newhart Show*. In 1986, Bonerz co-starred with Tuesday Weld and River Phoenix in the television movie *Circle of Violence: A Family Drama*. In 1999, he played Ed. Weinberger in the movie *Man on the Moon*. He voiced Sal in the *Aaahh!!! Real Monsters* episode \"Internal Affairs\".

It published comics from 1929 to 1973. At its peak, it was the most prominent and successful American company in the medium.[1] In 1953, Dell claimed to be the world's largest comics publisher, selling 26 million copies each month.[2]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Origins\n\n[edit]Its first title was *The Funnies* (1929), described by the Library of Congress as \"a short-lived newspaper tabloid insert\" rather than a comic book.[3] Comics historian Ron Goulart describes the 16-page, four-color, newsprint periodical as \"more a Sunday comic section without the rest of the newspaper than a true comic book. But it did offer all original material and was sold on newsstands\".[4] It ran 36 weekly issues, published Saturdays from January 16, 1929, to October 16, 1930.[5] The cover price rose from 10\u00a2 to 30\u00a2 with issue #3.[6] This was reduced to a nickel from issue #22 to the end.[6]\n\nIn 1933, Dell collaborated with Eastern Color Printing to publish the 36-page *Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics*, considered by historians the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\".[7][8] It was distributed through the Woolworth's department store chain, though it is unclear whether it was sold or given away; the cover displays no price, but Goulart refers, either metaphorically or literally, to the publisher \"sticking a ten-cent pricetag [sic] on the comic books\".[9]\n\nIn early 1934, Dell published the single-issue *Famous Funnies: Series 1*, also printed by Eastern Color. Unlike its predecessor, it was intended from the start to be sold rather than given away.[10][11]\n\nIn 1936, the company partnered with McClure Syndicate in which Dell would finance and distribute publications that McClure would produce and edit on behalf of then-company executive Max Gaines and editor Sheldon Mayer. Among the titles Gaines oversaw were *The Comics*, *Popular Comics* and *The Funnies*.[12][13] Gaines would leave McClure, and by extension, Dell in 1939, in order to set up All-American Publications with a distribution\/partnership agreement at DC.[14]\n\n### Western Publishing\n\n[edit]The company formed a partnership in 1938 with Western Publishing, in which Dell would finance and distribute publications that Western would produce. While this diverged from the regular practice in the medium of one company handling finance and production and outsourcing distribution, it was a highly successful enterprise with titles selling in the millions. Most of the Dell-produced comics done for Western Publishing during this period were under the **Whitman Comics** banner (later also used by Gold Key Comics); notable titles included *Crackajack Funnies* (1938\u20131942) and *Super Comics* (1938\u20131949).\n\nComic book historian Mark Carlson has stated that at its peak in the mid-1950s, \"while Dell\u2019s total number of comic book titles [was] only 15% of those published, it control[ed] nearly a third of the total market. Dell [had] more million-plus sellers than any other company before or since\".[15]\n\n### Licensed material\n\n[edit]Dell Comics was best known for its licensed material, most notably the animated characters from Walt Disney Productions, Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Walter Lantz Studio, along with many movie and television properties such as the Lone Ranger, Tarzan, Felix the Cat, Howdy Doody, Yogi Bear and other Hanna-Barbera characters.\n\n*Four Color*\n\n[edit]From 1938 to 1962, Dell's most notable and prolific title was the anthology *Four Color*.[16] Published several times a month, the title (which primarily consisted of standalone issues featuring various licensed properties) saw more than 1,300 issues published in its 23-year history. It often served as a try-out title (much like DC's *Showcase*) and thus the launching pad for many long-running series, a number of which (such as *The Twilight Zone*) were continued not by Dell, but Gold Key Comics, the competing company formed when Western ended its partnership (see below).\n\n### Lil' Eightball\n\n[edit]Responding to pressure from the African-American community, the character Lil' Eightball (who appeared in a handful of Walter Lantz cartoons in the late 1930s and in those initial appearances constituted what animation and comics historian Michael Barrier described as being a \"grotesquely stereotypical black boy\") was discontinued as one of the featured characters in the Lantz anthology comic book *New Funnies*; the last appearance of the character was in the August 1947 issue.[17]\n\n### Fredric Wertham\n\n[edit]In 1948, Dell refused an invitation of membership in the nascent Association of Comics Magazine Publishers. The association had been formed to pre-empt government intervention in the face of mounting public criticism of comic books. Dell vice-president Helen Meyer told Congress that Dell had opted out of the association because they didn't want their less controversial offerings to serve as \"an umbrella for the crime comic publishers\".[18] When the Comics Code was formed in 1954 in reaction to Wertham's *Seduction of the Innocent*, Dell again refused to join and instead began publishing in its comics a \"Pledge to Parents\" that promised their editorial process \"eliminates, rather than regulates, objectional [sic] material\" and concluded with the now classic credo \"Dell Comics Are Good Comics.\"\n\nBart Beaty in his book *Fredric Wertham and the Critique of Mass Culture* describes a concerted campaign by Dell against publication of Wertham's *Seduction of the Innocent* to the extent of recruiting several of the companies that it licensed characters from (including Warner Brother Cartoons, the Lone Ranger Inc. and Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc.) to send letters of protest to Wertham's publisher Stanley Rinehart.[19]\n\nDell in this period even burnished its image by taking out full-page ads in the *Saturday Evening Post* in late 1952 and early 1953 that emphasized the wholesomeness of its comics.[2]\n\n### Dell Comics Club and subscription promotions\n\n[edit]From mid-1950 to Spring 1959 Dell promoted subscriptions to its non-Disney titles with what it called the Dell Comics Club. Membership was automatic with any one year subscription to such titles and came with a certificate of membership plus a group portrait of the most prominent non-Disney characters published by Dell. Dell also offered various subscription premiums during the 1940s and 1950s (in some cases these were prints of covers or other character artwork and in one instance a cel from a Warner Brothers cartoon) in what Mark Evanier has dubbed a coordinated concerted \"aggressive subscription push\"[20] and offered the option of an illustrated note or card be sent to the recipients of a gift subscription for birthdays or Christmas.[21]\n\nMulti-year subscriptions were also available (in the case of *Walt Disney's Comics and Stories*, at one point in the 1940s subscriptions for up to five years were offered).[22][23]\n\n### Alternate format\n\n[edit]In 1961, Dell issued two atypical, comic-book like paperbacks without coloring, with cardboard covers and heavier-weight paper than standard comics, and selling for one dollar when most comic books were 12 cents: the 116-page *The Flintstones on the Rocks*[24] and the 117-page *Huck & Yogi Jamboree*[25][26] One historian describes the latter as \"a collection of drawings with text (there\u2019s not a word balloon to be found). But there are drawings that are sequential which tell stories.... [T]his was intended for Huck and Yogi\u2019s *adult* fans. Of which there apparently were more than a few, given the format and high price \u2014 $1!\"[27]\n\n### Western partnership ends, Dell declines\n\n[edit]In 1961, Dell became the first comic book company to increase its cover prices, raising the prices to fifteen cents; this was soon lowered to twelve cents.[28] In 1962 the partnership with Western ended, with Western taking most of its licensed properties and its original material and creating its own imprint, Gold Key Comics.[1]\n\nWhile most of the talent who had worked on the Dell line continued at Gold Key, a few creators like John Stanley stuck with Dell and its new line. Dell also drew new talent to its fold, such as Frank Springer, Don Arneson, and Lionel Ziprin.\n\nDell Comics continued for another 11 years with licensed television and motion picture adaptations (including *Mission: Impossible*, *Ben Casey*, *Burke's Law*, *Doctor Kildare*, *Beach Blanket Bingo*) and a few generally poorly received original titles. Among the few long lasting series from this time include the teen-comic *Thirteen Going on Eighteen* (29 issues, written by John Stanley), *Ghost Stories* (37 issues, #1 only written by John Stanley), *Combat* (40 issues), *Ponytail* (20 issues), *Kona Monarch of Monster Isle* (20 issues), *Toka the Jungle King* (10 issues), and *Naza Stone Age Warrior* (9 issues).[29] Dell additionally attempted to do superhero titles, including *Nukla*, *Superheroes* (starring the Fab 4, as the group's name was spelled on covers),[30][31] *Brain Boy*, and a critically ridiculed[ citation needed] trio of titles based on the Universal Pictures monsters Frankenstein, Dracula and Werewolf that recast the characters as superheroes.\n\nDell Comics ceased publication in 1973,[32] with a few of its former titles moving to Gold Key Comics.[ citation needed]\n\n## Corporate acquisitions\n\n[edit]Dell was acquired by Doubleday in 1976.[33] Doubleday was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1986, who formed Bantam Doubleday Dell as its US subsidiary.[34] Bertelsmann acquired Random House in 1998 and renamed its US business after the acquisition.[35] After the merger, Bantam was merged with Dell Publishing.[36] In 2001, Random House purchased Golden Books' book publishing properties[37] effectively reuniting the remnants of Dell and Western Publishing. Bantam Dell became part of the Random House publishing group in 2008.[38] Ballantine Books was merged with Bantam Dell in 2010.[39] In 2013, Random House merged with Penguin to form Penguin Random House.[40]\n\n## Fan revivals\n\n[edit]After Dell ceased publication, a number of its obscure characters were brought back in independent comics. In August 2016, InDELLible Comics was formed in tribute to the public domain characters orphaned by Dell.

It was one of the first half-hour American TV shows that dealt with serious contemporary social issues.\n\n[1]\n\nIn 1970, *Room 222* earned the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding New Series, while Constantine and Valentine won for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively.\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]Although the series primarily focuses on an American history class in Room 222 at the fictional Walt Whitman High School, in Los Angeles, California, it also depicts other events in and outside the school, such as the home lives of the racially diverse student body and faculty.\n\nThe history class is taught by Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes), an idealistic African American teacher. Other characters featured in the show include the school's compassionate guidance counselor, Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas), who is also Pete's girlfriend; the dryly humorous school principal, Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine); the petite and enthusiastic Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine), who is initially a student teacher, later full-time teacher whom Pete mentors; and Principal Kaufman's secretary, Miss Hogarth, played by Patsy Garrett. Also, many recurring students are featured from episode to episode.\n\nPete Dixon delivers gentle lessons in tolerance and understanding to his students, and they admire his wisdom, insight, and easygoing manner. The themes of the episodes are sometimes topical, reflecting the contemporary political climate of the late 1960s and early-to-mid 1970s, such as the Vietnam War, women's rights, race relations, and Watergate. However, most plots are timeless and feature themes still common to modern-day teenagers. For example, the 1969 episode \"Funny Boy\" deals with a class clown who is self-conscious about being overweight. In the 1971 episode \"What Is a Man?\", a student is a mistaken victim of anti-gay harassment, while the 1974 episode \"I Didn't Raise My Girl to Be a Soldier\" delves into parent\u2013teenage child issues.[2]\n\n## Cast\n\n[edit]### Main cast\n\n[edit]- Lloyd Haynes as Mr. Pete Dixon, the protagonist, teaches 11th grade American History in room 222 of Walt Whitman High School\n- Denise Nicholas as Miss Liz McIntyre, guidance counselor at Whitman, dating Pete\n- Michael Constantine as Mr. Seymour Kaufman, the principal of Whitman, preoccupied with his duties but dryly humorous\n- Karen Valentine as Miss Alice Johnson, a student teacher learning from Pete\n\n### Recurring cast\n\n[edit]- Jan Shutan as Bonnie, (8 episodes, 1969\u20131970)\n- Heshimu Cumbuka (as Heshimu) as Jason Allen, the \"tough guy\" of the class (89 episodes, 1969\u20131974)\n- David Jolliffe as Bernie, the school basketball star (83 episodes, 1969\u20131974)\n- Judy Strangis as Helen Loomis, the \"quiet kid\" of the class (70 episodes, 1969\u20131974)\n- Howard Rice as Richie Lane, the \"brainy\" kid in the class (35 episodes, 1969\u20131971)\n- Ta-Tanisha as Pam, the \"popular girl\" of the class (31 episodes, 1969\u20131972)\n- Eric Laneuville as Larry (29 episodes, 1970\u20131974)\n- Ivor Francis as Mr. Kenneth Dragen (16 episodes, 1969\u20131974)\n- Patsy Garrett as Miss Hogarth (12 episodes, 1969\u20131973)\n- Robert Casper as Mr. Wisegarten, Mr Girard (12 episodes, 1969\u20131973)\n- Ty Henderson as Cleon (8 episodes, 1972\u20131974)\n- Ramon Bieri as Mr. Gil Casey, vice principal (4 episodes, 1969\u20131970)\n- Helen Kleeb as Miss Tandy (4 episodes, 1969\u20131971)\n- Bruno Kirby as Herbie Considine (3 episodes, 1971\u20131973)\n- Eve McVeagh as Madge Morano, Mrs Cates, PTA Member (2 episodes, 1969, 1971)\n\n### Guest stars\n\n[edit]Notable guest stars during the series five-season run include Larry Linville, Cindy Williams, Chuck Norris, Nancy Wilson, DeForest Kelley, Rob Reiner, Richard Dreyfuss, Burgess Meredith, Kurt Russell, Aretha Franklin, Bernie Kopell, Mako, Don Most, Angela Cartwright, Ed Begley Jr., Dabney Coleman and Mark Hamill.\n\n## Episodes\n\n[edit]| Season | Episodes | Originally released | Rank | Rating | ||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| First released | Last released | |||||\n| 1 | 26 | September 17, 1969 | March 18, 1970 | 35[3] | 19.4[3] | |\n| 2 | 26 | September 23, 1970 | April 7, 1971 | |||\n| 3 | 23 | September 17, 1971 | March 3, 1972 | 28 | 19.8[a] | |\n| 4 | 23 | September 15, 1972 | March 9, 1973 | 42[4] | 18.4[4] | |\n| 5 | 15[b] | September 14, 1973 | January 11, 1974 | 67[5] | 13.8[5] |\n\n## Production\n\n[edit]The program was filmed at 20th Century Fox studios. Exterior shots of Los Angeles High School, pre-1971 earthquake, were shown in the opening credits, and some outdoor scenes in the early seasons.[6]\n\nThe show draws some comparisons to a theatrical movie which premiered during the show's first season, *Halls of Anger*. In that movie, a new, black teacher joins a southern California high school; an attractive, sympathetic black female member of staff shows romantic interest; a militant black student is frequently involved in situations; issues of racism and integration are featured. The film and television show also share actors (Ta-Tanisha, Helen Kleeb, Rob Reiner). However, while *Room 222* is a comedy drama, milder in tone, *Halls of Anger* is purposefully aggressive, using deliberately controversial language and some forceful violence to highlight the real and dangerous potential of unresolved racial conflict.\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]*Room 222'*s initial episodes garnered weak ratings, and ABC was poised to cancel the program after one season. However, the show earned several nominations at the 1970 Emmy Awards, and ABC relented. In the spring of 1970, *Room 222* won Emmy Awards for Best New Series; Best Supporting Actor (Michael Constantine); and Best Supporting Actress (Karen Valentine). The following year, Constantine and Valentine were again nominated in the supporting acting awards category.\n\nAfter the shaky first season, *Room 222* nevertheless managed to receive respectable ratings during its next three years. Ratings peaked during the 1971\u201372 season, during which it held a #28 viewership ranking. By the start of the 1973\u201374 season, ratings had fallen drastically, and ABC canceled the show at mid-season. After the series ended, the program entered syndication and was rerun on several television stations throughout the United States.\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]The Television Academy Foundation has credited *Room 222* for not only in the way it portrayed a racially integrated classroom and revolved around \"a dedicated and student-friendly African-American history teacher,\" but also for predating Norman Lear's 1970s sitcoms when it came to invoking serious social issues, stating that \"A season and a half before Norman Lear made \"relevant\" programming a dominant genre with the introduction of programs like *All in the Family* and *Maude*, *Room 222* was using the form of the half-hour comedy to discuss serious contemporary issues. During its five seasons on the air, the show included episodes that dealt with such topics as racism, sexism, homophobia, dropping out of school, shoplifting, drug use among both teachers and students, illiteracy, cops in school, guns in school, Vietnam war veterans, venereal disease, and teenage pregnancy\".[1] According to the Television Academy Foundation, \"the show broke new narrative ground that would later be developed by the major sitcom factories of the 1970s, Grant Tinker's MTM Enterprises and Norman Lear's Tandem Productions.\"[1]\n\n## Music\n\n[edit]The theme song was written by composer Jerry Goldsmith, written primarily with a 7\/4 time signature. His theme and two episode scores for the series (\"Richie's Story\" (the pilot) and \"The Flu\") were later issued by Film Score Monthly on an album with his score for the film *Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies*.\n\n## Books and comics\n\n[edit]A series of novels based on characters and dialog of the series was written by William Johnston and published by Tempo Books in the early 1970s. Dell Comics published a comic book for four issues during 1970 and 1971.\n\n## Home media and rights\n\n[edit]In 2009 and 2010, Shout! Factory sublicensed the home videos rights from Fox, releasing the first two seasons of the show on DVD in Region 1. As of 2022, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print. It is unknown if the remaining three seasons will be released. In 2019, Rupert Murdoch sold most of 21st Century Fox's film and television assets to Disney, and *Room 222* was included in the deal.[7]\n\n| DVD name | Ep # | Release date |\n|---|---|---|\n| Season One | 26 | March 24, 2009 |\n| Season Two | 26 | January 19, 2010 |\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b**\"Room 222\".

This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

He was ethnically perhaps the most Danish Prince of the Danish Royal dynasty in his generation (at the time of Denmark's most recent succession crisis).\n\nHis family belonged to the House of Oldenburg, the royal house that included all the medieval Scandinavian royal dynasties among its distant forebears - which it shared with his rivals and relatives, other claimants to the Danish throne. Both lines claim descent from the medieval Danish House of Estridsen via Christian I of Denmark's ancestress Richeza of Denmark, Lady of Werle, the daughter of Eric V of Denmark, but Frederick also descended from Eric V's son Christopher II of Denmark whom no heir or monarch of Denmark had been descended from since Christopher III of Denmark. Frederik's paternal grandfather happened to have both grandfathers who were \"Royal\" dukes from the Oldenburg dynasty.\n\nFrederick also differed from his rivals in his specific ancestry among the contemporary Danish high nobility. His mother was from an ancient Danish family (Danneskiold-Sams\u00f8e), and his paternal grandmother Louise Auguste of Denmark was its royal princess. His paternal grandfather Frederik Christian II, Duke of Augustenborg numbered two ladies of Danish high nobility as his grandmothers (Danneskiold-Sams\u00f8e and Reventlow), and one Danish Countess as paternal great-grandmother (Ahlefeldt-Langeland). Frederick's family had high hopes that in the then-rising era of nationalism, this ancestry would be viewed with favour when the legal question over whose claim was strongest would be decided. The family groomed Frederick to become a King of Denmark.\n\nUnfortunately, Frederick, despite his more ethnically Danish ancestry was to become a symbol of German nationalism. Insider circles of Danish Royal government, for various reasons, were not favourable to the Augustenburgs. Instead, the Princess of Hesse and Prince of Glucksburg, closer relatives of the then royal family's core, were preferred. Prince Frederick's father became a protagonist in the 1848-1851 First Schleswig War, to the hostility of Danish nationalists.\n\nPrince Frederick's inherited claims were strongest to the almost wholly German-speaking Duchy of Holstein, while his rights as the heir-male of the House of Oldenburg proved too difficult to pursue, and Holstein, an originally Holy Roman Empire fief, had the Salic Law as a leading principle in its fundamental succession law. Schleswig and Denmark, much more Scandinavian in legal history, had legal precedents for elective and female succession. Frederick and his father, however Danish they actually were, realised this and leant towards German interests.\n\nYoung Frederick's father found himself in an untenable position after the collapse of Prussian support and defeat of his own government at the end of the First Schleswig War in 1851. He renounced his claims as first in line to inherit the twin duchies in favour of the king of Denmark and his successors on 31 March 1852 in return for a financial compensation. The ducal family was banished.[1]\nFrederick now became the symbol of the nationalist German independence movement in Schleswig-Holstein. The renunciation was a hurdle which was explained away by the Augustenburg dynasty and the German nationalists as not having any effect on Frederick, who had not personally renounced anything and on whose behalf no one, including the father, was empowered to make renunciations. Frederick's marriage in 1856 was part of an appeal to German nationalism (however, his younger brother married a daughter of Queen Victoria).\n\nIn November 1863 Frederick claimed the twin-duchies in succession after the death without a male heir of King Frederick VII of Denmark, who was also the Duke of Schleswig and Holstein. As Holstein was inherited after the salic law among descendants of Hedwig of Holstein, the independence movement had long nourished hopes that the king's death would lead to their goal. The Kingdom of Denmark was also under so-called Semi-Salic Law, but its male line ended with Frederick VII and Danish law contained a Semi-Salic provision which resulted in the election of Christian of Gl\u00fccksburg as new monarch. German nationalists claimed that Schleswig was also inherited according to the unmodified Salic Law, but this claim was refused by the Danish government, arguing that this province was subject to Danish law.\n\nOtto von Bismarck used the turbulence to invade the duchies in a Second War of Schleswig. The rule of Denmark in the duchies was terminated, and Frederick triumphantly entered Kiel, where he was eagerly welcomed. However, numerous political complications arose which prevented the formal reinstatement of the dynasty. By the terms of the Treaty of Vienna (October, 1864), the duchies were relinquished to Prussia and Austria, to be disposed of by them. Prussia, however, imposed conditions upon Frederick which made it impossible for him to assume the government. After the Peace of Prague, which terminated the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the lands were finally absorbed into the Kingdom of Prussia.[1]\n\nFrederick subsequently served on the staff of the Crown Prince, Frederick William of Prussia, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71.[1] Frederick and his heirs continued to use their title, which after the next generation passed to the Glucksburg branch, to heirs of an elder brother of Christian IX of Denmark.\n\n## Marriage and children\n\n[edit]On September 11, 1856 Frederick married Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a German. She was the second daughter of Ernst Christian Carl IV, Duke of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Princess Feodora of Leiningen, elder half-sister of Queen Victoria. They were parents to seven children:\n\n- Prince\n*Friedrich*Wilhelm Victor Karl Ernst Christian August (August 3, 1857 \u2013 October 20, 1858). - Princess\n*Auguste Viktoria*Friederike Luise Feodora Jenny (October 22, 1858 \u2013 April 11, 1921).

Married Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia. He was a male-line great-grandson of Frederick William III of Prussia. - Princess\n*Feodora Adelheid*Helene Luise Karoline Gustave Pauline Alice Jenny (July 3, 1874 \u2013 June 21, 1910).\n\n## Ancestry\n\n[edit]| Ancestors of Frederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\n\n## References\n\n[edit]### Citations\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b**Gilman, D.

He received a B.S. in Civil Engineering from the University of Alabama in 1975, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon and Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity.[5][6]\n\nStimpson began a nearly 40-year career in his family's lumber manufacturing business. Starting at an early age, he worked his way up through virtually every position in the family business including serving as its CFO and ultimately its Executive Vice President.\n\nStimpson is married to Jean Miller of Brewton, Alabama. They have been married since 1975 and have four grown, married children and 14 grandchildren. They are longtime, active members of Ashland Place United Methodist Church.[7]\n\nMayor Stimpson\u2019s civic and business endeavors, both locally and statewide, have been numerous and varied. He has served on the boards of the Boys & Girls Club of Southwest Alabama; the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce; the conservative think tank, the Alabama Policy Institute; the Business Council of Alabama; and the University of Alabama President\u2019s Cabinet.[8]\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]Upon graduating from the University of Alabama, Stimpson began a 37-year career with Gulf Lumber Company and its successor, Scotch & Gulf Lumber. He was chief financial officer prior to leaving the company to run for office in 2012.[9]\n\n### Mayor of Mobile\n\n[edit]He was elected August 27, 2013, with 54% of the vote, defeating incumbent Mayor Sam Jones.[10] Stimpson ran on a platform of public safety and economic development.[11][12][13][14] Stimpson was elected largely as a result of a surge in white voters, and received only single-digit support from African American voters.[15]\n\nIn 2017, Stimpson was reelected with 59% of the vote over Jones in a rematch.[16] He again polled in single digits with African American voters.[17] In 2021, he defeated Fred Richardson[ who?] and Karlos Finley\n\n[with 62.5% of the vote.\n\n*who?*][18]In 2025, he decided to not run for reelection.\n\n[4]\n\nUnder Stimpson, Mobile has seen reductions in bonded indebtedness by nearly $100 million and unfunded liabilities for pension and benefits by $200 million, leading to credit rating increases from both Moody's and S&P. During the same period, he has built and maintained a two-month rainy day reserve fund and awarded six raises totaling 17% for city employees.[19][20] Stimpson and his team made changes to streamline and simplify the city procurement process, and launched the city\u2019s first supplier diversity program.[21][22][23][24] Stimpson and his team have introduced initiatives such as Map for Mobile and the city\u2019s first supplier diversity program.[25][26][27][28]\n\nHowever, Stimpson has also repeatedly opposed environmental protection initiatives and health and safety legislation, despite severe pollution levels in Mobile.[29] Stimpson's administration has systematically reduced funding for the arts and heritage, substantially reducing allocations to the Historic Mobile Preservation Society, the Mobile Arts Council, the Mobile Opera, the Mobile Symphony Orchestra, and other local museums, which led to a number of layoffs.[30]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Sandy Stimpson elected as Mayor of Mobile\" Archived 2013-08-30 at the Wayback Machine, wkrg.com, August 27, 2013**^**\"Mayor Stimpson Wins Re-Election\"**^**\"Election Results\". 30 April 2022.- ^\n**a**Everett, Grayson (2024-09-27). \"Who might run for Mayor of Mobile?\".**b***Yellowhammer News*.

It is the third-most populous county in the state after Jefferson and Madison counties. As of the 2020 census, its population was 414,809.[2] Its county seat is Mobile, which was founded as a deepwater port on the Mobile River. The only such port in Alabama, it has long been integral to the economy for providing access to inland waterways as well as the Gulf of Mexico.[3]\n\nThe city, river, and county were named in honor of *Maubila*, a village of the paramount chief Tuskaloosa of the regional Mississippian culture. In 1540 he arranged an ambush of soldiers of Hernando de Soto's expedition in an effort to expel them from the territory. The Spaniards were armed with guns and killed many of the tribe. Mobile County and Washington County, Alabama make up the Mobile Metropolitan Statistical Area with a 2020 population of 430,197. The Mobile, AL MSA and Daphne-Fairhope-Foley, AL MSA make up the much larger Mobile-Daphne-Fairhope CSA with a 2020 population of 661,964.\n\nThe northern border of Mobile County and southern area of neighboring Washington County constitute the homeland of the state-recognized tribe of MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, descendants of Choctaw and Creek who stayed in this area during the period of Indian Removal. They have organized to preserve their culture and language. They were the first of nine tribes to be recognized by the state.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]This area was occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of Spanish expeditions in the early 16th century, it was part of the territory of the Mississippian culture, which constructed major earthwork mounds. It was ruled by the paramount chief Tuskaloosa.\n\nThe historic Choctaw emerged somewhat later, and are believed to be descendants of those earlier peoples. They occupied this area along what early French traders and colonists called the Mobile River. They also founded the settlement of Mobile on the river and bay in the early 18th century.\n\nThe British took over the territory in 1763 (along with other French territories east of the Mississippi River) after defeating the French in the Seven Years' War. During the American Revolutionary War, it came under Spanish rule as part of Spanish Florida. Spain ceded the territory to the United States after the War of 1812.\n\nIn the 1830s, the United States forced the removal of most of the Native American tribes in the area under President Andrew Jackson's policy and an act of Congress to relocate them to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Many of those who remained continued their culture, and took refuge in the swamps in the border area between Mobile and Washington counties. Since the late 20th century, several tribes have reorganized and gained state recognition. Among those is the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, which was recognized as a tribe in 1979 by the state. The people have long been based in this area of the former Choctaw homeland, along the northern border of Mobile County and the southern border of Washington County.\n\nAfter more than a century of European settlement, beginning with French colonists, Mobile County was organized by the state legislature and the proclamation of Governor Holmes of the Mississippi Territory on December 18, 1812.[1]\nWhen Mississippi was separated and admitted as a state on December 10, 1817, after adopting its constitution on August 15, 1817, Mobile County became part of what was called the Alabama Territory. Two years later, the county became part of the state of Alabama, granted statehood on December 14, 1819.[4][5]\n\nThe city of Mobile, first settled by French colonists in the early 18th century as part of *La Louisiane,* was designated as the county seat from the early days of the county.[1] Both the county and city derive their name from Fort Louis de la Mobile, a French fortification established (near present-day Axis, Alabama) in 1702. The word \"Mobile\" is believed to stem from a Choctaw word for \"paddlers\".[1] The area was occupied by French colonists from 1702 to 1763, and their influence has been strong in the city. It was ruled by the British from 1763 to 1780, when more American colonists began to enter the territory; and controlled by the Spanish from 1780 to 1813.\n\nAt the end of the War of 1812, the United States took over the territory. At that time, new settlers were being attracted to the land, eager to develop short-staple cotton in the uplands area. Invention of the cotton gin made processing of this type of cotton profitable, stimulating wholesale development of new cotton plantations in the Black Belt during the antebellum years. Mobile developed as a major deepwater port; in the nineteenth century, cotton was its major export.\n\nThere were nine documented lynchings in Mobile from 1891 to 1981.\n\n- March 31, 1891 \u2014 Zachariah Graham\n[6] - October 2, 1906 \u2014 Roy Hoyle\n[7] - October 2, 1906 \u2014 Willie Thompson\n[8] - October 2, 1906 \u2014 Corneilius Robinson\n[9] - September 22, 1907 \u2014 Mose Dossett\n[10] - January 23, 1909 \u2014 Richard Robertson\n[11] - July 31, 1910 \u2014 Bill Walker\n[12] - June 6, 1919 \u2014 James E.

About 15.60% of families and 18.50% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.20% of those under age 18 and 14.60% of those age 65 or over.\n\n## Government\n\n[edit]### Local\n\n[edit]Mobile County has a limited form of home rule and is governed by a three-member county commission. Each commissioner represents a single-member district and is elected by the voters of that district to serve a four-year term. Each commissioner has an equal vote on the commission. During an elected term, each commissioner serves as President of the Mobile County Commission for 16 months, beginning with the District 1 Commissioner.\n\nAs of November 2024, Mobile County Commissioners are:\n\n- District 1 (northern County) \u2013 Merceria L. Ludgood (D)\n- District 2 (western and central County) \u2013 Connie Hudson (R)\n- District 3 (southern County) \u2013 Randall Dueitt (R)\n\n### State\n\n[edit]Under the state constitution, the legislature maintains considerable power over county affairs.\n\nMobile County is represented in the Alabama Legislature by four senators and nine representatives.\n\nState Senators representing portions of Mobile County are:[25]\n\n- Republican Greg Albritton (22nd District),\n- Democrat Vivian Davis Figures (33rd District),\n- Republican Jack W. Williams (34th District), and\n- Republican David Sessions (35th District).\n\nState Representatives representing portions of Mobile County are:[26]\n\n- Democrat Adline Clarke (97th District),\n- Democrat Napoleon Bracy (98th District),\n- Democrat Sam Jones (99th District),\n- Republican Mark Shirey (100th District),\n- Republican Chris Pringle (101st District),\n- Republican Shane Stringer (102nd District),\n- Democrat Barbara Drummond (103rd District),\n- Republican Margie Wilcox (104th District), and\n- Republican Chip Brown (105th District).\n\n## Education\n\n[edit]In most areas of Mobile County, schools are operated by the Mobile County Public School System. The cities of Chickasaw, Saraland, and Satsuma have separate school systems; served by Chickasaw City Schools, Saraland Board of Education, and Satsuma City School System, respectively.[27]\n\nMobile County is the home of the University of South Alabama (USA), a public research university divided into ten colleges, including one of Alabama's two state-supported medical schools. USA has an enrollment of over 16,000 students and employs more than 6,000 faculty, administrators, and support staff. It is also home to two private institutions of higher learning. Spring Hill College, founded in 1830, is Catholic and the third-oldest Jesuit college or university in the U.S. Its enrollment is about 1,500 students and it offers 46 academic majors. The University of Mobile, established in 1961 and affiliated with the Alabama Baptist Convention (the state convention of the Southern Baptist Convention), has an enrollment of about 2,000 and offers 90 academic majors.\n\n## Politics\n\n[edit]Mobile County is very conservative for an urban county. The last Democrat to win the county was John F. Kennedy in 1960 and is one of only 7 counties in Alabama to back Gerald Ford over Jimmy Carter in 1976. Within the city of Mobile, the margins between the Republican and Democrat candidates are usually between 10 and 19 points. Since 1996, the Democrats have gotten 40-45% of the vote.\n\n| Year | Republican | Democratic | Third party(ies) | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| \u2116 | % | \u2116 | % | \u2116 | % | |\n1824\n|\n155 | 38.08% | 205 | 50.37%\n|\n47 | 11.55% |\n1828\n|\n178 | 31.01% | 396 | 68.99%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1832\n|\n0 | 0.00% | 331 | 100.00%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1836\n|\n739 | 46.04% | 866 | 53.96%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1840\n|\n1,481 | 56.92%\n|\n1,121 | 43.08% | 0 | 0.00% |\n1844\n|\n1,403 | 51.02%\n|\n1,347 | 48.98% | 0 | 0.00% |\n1848\n|\n1,319 | 55.14%\n|\n1,073 | 44.86% | 0 | 0.00% |\n1852\n|\n1,123 | 43.24% | 1,380 | 53.14%\n|\n94 | 3.62% |\n1856\n|\n0 | 0.00% | 1,838 | 50.93%\n|\n1,771 | 49.07% |\n1860\n|\n0 | 0.00% | 1,823 | 36.51%\n|\n3,170 | 63.49% |\n1868\n|\n5,200 | 43.85% | 6,658 | 56.15%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1872\n|\n5,946 | 47.69% | 6,522 | 52.31%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1876\n|\n4,272 | 44.49% | 5,330 | 55.51%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1880\n|\n3,239 | 44.84% | 3,784 | 52.38%\n|\n201 | 2.78% |\n1884\n|\n2,787 | 49.69% | 2,806 | 50.03%\n|\n16 | 0.29% |\n1888\n|\n2,542 | 44.98% | 3,109 | 55.02%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1892\n|\n397 | 5.63% | 4,680 | 66.33%\n|\n1,979 | 28.05% |\n1896\n|\n2,778 | 37.76% | 3,948 | 53.66%\n|\n631 | 8.58% |\n1900\n|\n2,243 | 41.64% | 2,939 | 54.56%\n|\n205 | 3.81% |\n1904\n|\n325 | 8.84% | 3,283 | 89.33%\n|\n67 | 1.82% |\n1908\n|\n453 | 14.03% | 2,422 | 75.03%\n|\n353 | 10.94% |\n1912\n|\n140 | 3.72% | 3,009 | 79.98%\n|\n613 | 16.29% |\n1916\n|\n832 | 21.36% | 2,968 | 76.18%\n|\n96 | 2.46% |\n1920\n|\n2,681 | 29.71% | 6,171 | 68.39%\n|\n171 | 1.90% |\n1924\n|\n1,814 | 28.54% | 4,125 | 64.91%\n|\n416 | 6.55% |\n1928\n|\n5,058 | 45.84% | 5,965 | 54.07%\n|\n10 | 0.09% |\n1932\n|\n1,705 | 14.90% | 9,658 | 84.42%\n|\n78 | 0.68% |\n1936\n|\n1,072 | 8.64% | 11,165 | 89.95%\n|\n175 | 1.41% |\n1940\n|\n1,887 | 13.99% | 11,480 | 85.08%\n|\n126 | 0.93% |\n1944\n|\n2,867 | 23.08% | 9,439 | 75.98%\n|\n117 | 0.94% |\n1948\n|\n2,685 | 19.41% | 0 | 0.00% | 11,150 | 80.59%\n|\n1952\n|\n14,153 | 49.29% | 14,473 | 50.40%\n|\n89 | 0.31% |\n1956\n|\n20,639 | 52.21%\n|\n17,163 | 43.41% | 1,732 | 4.38% |\n1960\n|\n24,608 | 45.12% | 28,626 | 52.48%\n|\n1,308 | 2.40% |\n1964\n|\n49,493 | 70.72%\n|\n0 | 0.00% | 20,488 | 29.28% |\n1968\n|\n10,509 | 11.43% | 18,615 | 20.25% | 62,812 | 68.32%\n|\n1972\n|\n62,639 | 73.15%\n|\n20,694 | 24.17% | 2,301 | 2.69% |\n1976\n|\n53,835 | 50.85%\n|\n50,264 | 47.47% | 1,777 | 1.68% |\n1980\n|\n67,515 | 57.71%\n|\n46,180 | 39.47% | 3,297 | 2.82% |\n1984\n|\n81,923 | 62.56%\n|\n47,252 | 36.08% | 1,784 | 1.36% |\n1988\n|\n72,203 | 60.88%\n|\n45,524 | 38.39% | 870 | 0.73% |\n1992\n|\n72,935 | 50.72%\n|\n54,962 | 38.22% | 15,891 | 11.05% |\n1996\n|\n66,775 | 51.32%\n|\n54,749 | 42.08% | 8,579 | 6.59% |\n2000\n|\n78,162 | 55.93%\n|\n58,640 | 41.96% | 2,943 | 2.11% |\n2004\n|\n92,014 | 58.69%\n|\n63,732 | 40.65% | 1,025 | 0.65% |\n2008\n|\n98,049 | 54.04%\n|\n82,181 | 45.30% | 1,194 | 0.66% |\n2012\n|\n94,893 | 54.18%\n|\n78,760 | 44.97% | 1,487 | 0.85% |\n2016\n|\n95,116 | 55.06%\n|\n72,186 | 41.79% | 5,435 | 3.15% |\n2020\n|\n101,243 | 55.27%\n|\n79,474 | 43.39% | 2,447 | 1.34% |\n2024\n|\n100,759 | 57.52%\n|\n72,055 | 41.14% | 2,350 | 1.34% |\n\n## Communities\n\n[edit]### Cities\n\n[edit]- Bayou La Batre\n- Chickasaw\n- Citronelle\n- Creola\n- Mobile (county seat)\n- Prichard\n- Saraland\n- Satsuma\n- Semmes\n\n### Towns\n\n[edit]### Census-designated places\n\n[edit]### Unincorporated communities\n\n[edit]### Ghost town\n\n[edit]## See also\n\n[edit]- National Register of Historic Places listings in Mobile, Alabama\n- National Register of Historic Places listings in Mobile County, Alabama\n- Properties on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in Mobile County, Alabama\n\n## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b****c****d**\"Mobile County, Alabama history\".

The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger\u2019s causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nStroke is the second-leading cause of death and a major cause disability worldwide (Feigin, 2021) and, in particular, ischemic stroke constituted 62.4% of all new strokes in 2019. Focal stroke lesions affecting either cortical and sub-cortical neurons or descending fiber tracts may affect the neural processing in the motor network (Ward and Cohen, 2004; Stinear et al., 2007). This leads to motor deficit, mainly caused by hemiparesis, that is one of the most common stroke-related disabilities (Katan and Luft, 2018). Nevertheless, it has been observed that patients with initially mild to moderate motor impairments may show substantial recovery of the motor function within the first 3 months after stroke onset. This may be driven by neural plasticity and reorganization, which can occur in the brain also far from the lesion site (Nudo, 2006; Cramer, 2008; Rehme and Grefkes, 2013).\n\nTo investigate cortical functional reorganization, connectivity models based on the concept that the brain is organized in specialized anatomically distinct areas functionally integrated in networks (Friston, 2002) were applied to neuroimaging techniques, both in experimental and computational simulation studies (Falcon et al., 2016; Allegra Mascaro et al., 2020). Functional connectivity is usually inferred by means of correlations among measurements of neuronal activity neglecting information on the coupling direction, whereas the directed functional connectivity investigates the causal influence that a brain region exerts over another (Friston, 2011; Barrett and Barnett, 2013). In the literature, the analysis of cortical directed and undirected functional connectivity has been extensively used to characterize the brain connections and investigate rehabilitation effects on patients after stroke events (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Connectivity studies can be carried out during both task and resting state conditions, the latter being the easiest protocol executable also for patients in the acute stage. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that changes in resting state connectivity, especially in the motor network, are predictive of motor function recovery in stroke patients (James et al., 2009; Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Volz et al., 2016; Hordacre et al., 2020).\n\nAmong neuroimaging techniques, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was one of the first employed to investigate brain connectivity. Given its high spatial resolution and the provided volumetric information, fMRI allows investigation of connections involving both cortical and deep structures in the brain (Farr and Wegener, 2010). Electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed as a valid alternative technique, as it allowed to reconstruct known resting state networks from signals acquired by scalp electrodes in healthy subjects (Mantini et al., 2007). Despite its lower spatial resolution, EEG offers a higher time resolution with respect to fMRI, allowing to better track the fast reconfiguration of neuronal networks and to extract information on the spectral characteristics of the functional networks related to specific brain rhythms. Moreover, it exploits cheaper and portable instrumentation, allowing measurements both on healthy and pathological subjects, also accessible in complex medical setting (Borich et al., 2015).\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, a plethora of measures and indexes have been proposed to infer both functional and causal connectivity from EEG recordings (Pereda et al., 2005), including bivariate and conditional Granger causality (GC), transfer entropy (TE), directed transfer function (DTF), directed coherence (DC), partial directed coherence (PDC) and dynamical Bayesian inference. Each of these metrics may be sensitive to different aspects of the neurophysiological data, evidenced either in time or frequency domains or through linear or non-linear relationships. Therefore, the choice of a metric over another depends on the particular aspect of interest in the connectivity network; moreover, the reliability of a specific metric can depend on different factors related to the specific application, such as the stationarity of the signal, non-linear effects or indirect connections among networks nodes. Different causal connectivity metrics can lead to different results and careful interpretation is required. Usually, only one metric is chosen to retrieve networks\u2019 topology and infer the spectral content of the information flow between network nodes. However, the use of a single metric cannot guarantee a comprehensive description of the network (Blinowska, 2011). For instance, GC and TE provide compact information on the overall information flow between network nodes, while DTF, DC and PDC focus on specific rhythms of physiological interest (Sameshima and Baccal\u00e1, 2014; Seth et al., 2015); bivariate GC\/TE and DC detect the overall flow of information from one node to another, while conditional GC\/TE and DTF\/PDC elicit direct connections but may lose ability to capture the coupling strength (Faes et al., 2012). Finally, the dynamical Bayesian inference approach has been proposed to assess the cross-frequency coupling strength both in neural networks and among different physiological systems, e.g., cardio-respiratory-cortical interactions (Stankovski et al., 2016). Until now, an agreed standard measure to assess EEG-based causal connectivity is not univocally employed in the literature, and the selection of the most appropriate measure still represents an open issue.\n\nMoreover, in the context of EEG analysis, causal connectivity was often identified directly from the electrodes signal, but it has been demonstrated that connectivity computed in the electrode space is affected by the scalp volume-conduction effect and the obtained results can be hardly interpreted as real brain connectivity (Hassan and Wendling, 2018; Marinazzo et al., 2019; Van de Steen et al., 2019). On the contrary, meaningful connectivity patterns can be derived from cortical source activities extracted from EEG inverse solutions (Michel and Murray, 2012; Haufe et al., 2013).\n\nAlthough the effects of stroke on resting-state brain connectivity have been widely investigated, especially in the acute phase with respect to healthy subjects, a limited number of works focused specifically on longitudinal effects of motor rehabilitation on the reorganization of the cortical motor network after stroke. Moreover, the majority of studies exploited fMRI to assess functional, non-directed connectivity (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Considering EEG analysis, up to now, the majority of studies explored functional connectivity in post-stroke populations in both acute (Caliandro et al., 2017; Vecchio et al., 2019a, 2019b; Fanciullacci et al., 2021; Hoshino et al., 2021) and chronic stages (Gerloff et al., 2006; De Vico Fallani et al., 2009, 2017; Wu et al., 2015; Hordacre et al., 2020; Molteni et al., 2020; Waterstone et al., 2020; Romeo et al., 2021); only fewer studies investigated the resting-state causal connectivity after stroke (Guo et al., 2014; Pichiorri et al., 2015, 2018; Calabr\u00f2 et al., 2018; Nicolo et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021). The few studies cited above employing EEG rarely focused on the investigation of the motor network, preferring a large-scale connectivity analysis of the whole brain with synthetic descriptors. Even though this type of information can serve as a general indication on the state of brain\u2019s connections after stroke, information about power spectral strength or flow direction in the identified connections are often missing. This type of information can be obtained by separate connectivity metrics computed from electrodes or brain sources signals and whose underlying interpretation should be carefully considered to compare the results between different studies.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, the investigation of motor network directed functional connectivity by means of EEG in sub-acute stroke patients should be deepened from both methodological and application perspectives. To this aim, in this work we perform an EEG-based longitudinal study of resting-state causal connectivity in a population of sub-acute stroke patients with motor impairment who underwent a rehabilitation treatment. We focus on the characterization of the motor network exploiting the cortical source signals reconstructed from EEG scalp recordings and using two different connectivity metrics, i.e., the Directed Coherence (DC) and the generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Combining the information carried by these two measures, we aim to provide a description of the variations induced by treatment in both the topography and the transfer of spectral power along the identified functional connections, investigating also possible correlations with the clinical assessment of motor recovery.\n\nIn Section 2, a detailed description of the participants enrolled for this study and the methodology followed is presented. In Section 3, the obtained results are reported and their discussion can be found in Section 4. Section 5 draws conclusions of the work.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1 Population Description\n\nEighteen subjects (age 67 \u00b1 10, seven females and 11 males) in the sub-acute stage after ischemic stroke were enrolled for this study. Inclusion criteria were age less than 80 years old, first unilateral stroke, distance from acute event less than 30 days, with no other concomitant orthopedic or rheumatologic disease, without global or comprehension aphasia, right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. Each subject was evaluated twice: firstly, at the admission to the rehabilitation center (T0, on average after 12 \u00b1 5 days from the stroke event) and secondly at the end of the rehabilitation treatment (T1, on average after 55 \u00b1 11 days from the event). In Table 1, details about participants\u2019 characteristics are reported. To participate, each subject signed a written informed consent. The study was reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee \u201cComitato Etico Provinciale dell\u2019Insubria\u201d and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nPatients followed a rehabilitation treatment for both upper and lower limb recovery: each patient underwent to a rehabilitation treatment twice per day, each session lasting 45 min. Training was tailored according to patients\u2019 residuals motor capacity and it included exercise for upper and lower limbs. Lower and upper limbs stretching, lower and upper limbs muscle strengthening, static and dynamic balance exercises, proprioception exercises, trunk control exercise, gait at the parallel bars or in clinical open spaces were the exercise performed.\n\n### 2.2 Functional Assessment\n\nClinical evaluations were performed by clinicians, i.e., physiotherapist and medical doctor. To assess the upper limb performance the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) (Fugl-Meyer et al., 1975) before and after treatment was used. The FMA motor score ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 66 (upper limb normal motor performance). As for the lower limb, the level of walking ability was assessed by the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC). This gait assessment scale distinguishes six levels of walking ability based on the amount of physical support required. The lowest level 0 indicates a patient who is not able to walk, while level 5, indicates a patient who can walk everywhere independently, including stairs (Holden et al., 1984). Participants\u2019 scores assigned at T0 and T1 for both clinical scales, i.e., FMAT0, FMAT1, FAC T0 and FAC T1, are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe variations \u0394FMA = FMAT1\u2013FMAT0 and \u0394FAC = FACT1\u2013FACT0 was considered as primary clinical outcomes of subject\u2019s motor recovery.\n\n### 2.3 EEG Data Acquisition\n\nResting state EEG recordings were performed with the Neuroscan system (Compumedics Neuroscan, Compumedics, NC, United States) using 64 Ag\/AgCl electrodes placed according to the International 10\/20 standard system. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz, with the reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz positions and the ground electrode positioned anterior to Fz. During the acquisition, patients were asked to keep their eyes closed in a sitting relaxed position for at least 5 min. As for functional assessment, EEG recordings were repeated twice, before (T0) and after (T1) the rehabilitation treatment.\n\n### 2.4 EEG Data Analysis\n\nIn Figure 1, a scheme of the principal steps followed for the analysis of single EEG recordings is reported. Three main stages can be identified: EEG signal pre-processing, current sources reconstruction and directed functional connectivity. In the scheme, inputs and outputs of each block are highlighted. Detailed explanation of each step is provided in the following sections.\n\n**FIGURE 1**. Pipeline of single acquisition and analysis. Abbreviations: MVAR, multivariate auto-regressive; DC, Directed Coherence; gPDC, generalized partial directed coherence.\n\n##### 2.4.1 EEG Pre-Processing\n\nEEG signals were pre-processed offline in Matlab environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) using the open source EEGLab signal processing Toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).\n\nData were down-sampled at 128 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 45 Hz to remove slow drifts and high-frequency components, such as the power line noise. Flat and \u201cbad\u201d channels were removed for further analysis. A flat channel was identified if it showed amplitude around zero (flatline) for more than 5 s consecutively, whereas a channel was identified as \u201cbad\u201d if it was noisy for more than 90% of the acquisition duration. An Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm (Mullen et al., 2015) was applied to all retained channels to identify and remove transient or high-amplitude artifacts, e.g., eye movements. According to Chang and others (Chang et al., 2020), the application of this cleaning approach improves the accuracy of subsequent Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The ASR algorithm automatically identifies clean periods of the EEG data using a sliding window. An artifact rejection threshold is calculated, based on the calibration signal distribution of variance and a user-defined cut-off parameter. Data portions, whose variance is larger than this threshold, are removed and reconstructed from neighboring channels using a covariance matrix computed from the calibration data. According to the cut-off parameter *k* chosen by the user, the method can be more or less aggressive in removing EEG components portions of data. In this work, *k* = 20 was employed, according to the range suggested by Chang and others, who validated the ASR method on real EEG data and found that a *k* in the range 10\u2013100 allows removing ocular artifacts still preserving cerebral components (Chang et al., 2020). Furthermore, ICA was applied to the ASR-cleaned EEG recordings exploiting the RUNICA Infomax algorithm as implemented in EEGLab (Makeig and Bell, 1996). RUNICA un-mixes the EEG recordings in cortical and non-cortical spatially distinct and temporally independent components (IC). Once the non-cortical components are identified and removed, the final cleaned EEG signal can be reconstructed. To guide the selection of ICs accounting for non-brain (artifactual) activities the ICLabel plugin was employed (Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019). It is an automated classifier which provides an estimation of the type of each of the IC (brain, eye, muscle, line noise, etc.) based on some component characteristics, i.e., power spectrum, its time-course, topography dipole localization and percentage data variance accounted in the considered component. A final visual check of the signals was performed. The originally removed \u201cbad\u201d channels were then reconstructed by the interpolation of the neighbor channels signals, thus obtaining a uniform EEG spatial sampling. Finally, EEG data were re-referenced to a common average reference and 1 min of cleaned, artifact-free 60 channels EEG was selected for all subjects.\n\n##### 2.4.2 Individual Alpha Frequency\n\nTo improve the accuracy of the EEG analysis in the frequency domain, the interindividual variability of the alpha rhythm peak was considered for the determination of the spectral bands of interest, as proposed by Klimesch in 1999 (Klimesch, 1999). In particular, for the purpose of this study, we focused our analysis on alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands, which are reported as the most involved in motor system functions (Pfurtscheller et al., 1994, 1996). After computing the power spectral density (PSD) for the parieto-occipital channels by the Welch method (Welch, 1967), the Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF) was determined as the average peak position in the spectral range 7.5\u201312.5 Hz. The average IAF found in our population was equal to 9.07 \u00b1 0.99 Hz. The IAF was used to define the alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands as follow: \u03b1 = [IAF-2 Hz \u00f7 IAF+2 Hz] and \u03b2 = [IAF+2.5 Hz \u00f7 IA\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_YxPZ4oR96QVBcOrzgb1zYpyB\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35450158\/\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35450158\/\n# Resting State EEG Directed Functional Connectivity Unveils Changes in Motor Network Organization in Subacute Stroke Patients After Rehabilitation\n\n-\nPMID:\n**35450158** - PMCID: PMC9016279\n- DOI: 10.3389\/fphys.2022.862207\n\n# Resting State EEG Directed Functional Connectivity Unveils Changes in Motor Network Organization in Subacute Stroke Patients After Rehabilitation\n\n## Abstract\n\nBrain plasticity and functional reorganization are mechanisms behind functional motor recovery of patients after an ischemic stroke. The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger's causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n\n**\nKeywords:\n**\nEEG; brain sources; causal connectivity; directed coherence; motor network; partial direct coherence; stroke; subacute.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Pirovano, Mastropietro, Antonacci, Bar\u00e0, Guanziroli, Molteni, Faes and Rizzo.\n\n## Conflict of interest statement\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n## Figures\n\n## References\n\n-\n- Allegra Mascaro A.

Using resting-state EEG, it delves into the *directed* functional connections within the motor network of patients in the subacute stage, post-rehabilitation. The investigation highlights changes in information flow by employing and comparing two frequency-domain measures designed to assess causal influence, differentiating direct pathways from mediated ones, particularly within alpha and beta rhythms. The research team brought together expertise from Italy's national research council, university departments spanning the mainland to Sicily, and a dedicated rehabilitation facility. Among the authors is a female figure prominent in Italian biomedical research, whose background includes foundational work on autonomic nervous system signals derived from ECG, as well as contributions to sophisticated neuroimaging analyses involving diffusion techniques and magnetization transfer, sometimes collaborating with London-based institutions.

It was renamed as East Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd on 23 June 1962. It was again renamed as Dacca Stock Exchange Ltd on 13 May 1964. After 1971 the trading was discontinued for five years. In 1976 trading restarted in Bangladesh, and DSE was started on 16 September 1986. The formula for calculating DSE all share price index was changed according to IFC on 1 November 1993. Automated trading was initiated on 10 August 1998 and started on 1 January 2001. A central securities depository system was initiated on 24 January 2004.\n\nAs of 16 November 2009, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) crossed 4000 points for the first time, setting a new high at 4148 points. In 2010, the index crossed 8500 points and finally crashed in the first quarter of 2011. Millions of investors lost their money and came out onto the street, blaming the speculators and regulators for the bubble that finally burst in what became known as the 2011 Bangladesh share market scam. Currently, there are 22 industrial sectors in DSE which accommodate 625 listed companies. In January 2023, DSE and Nasdaq announced their partnership with trading technology.[6] However, no new companies were approved for IPOs in 2024, underscoring the market's paralysis. Well-performing family-owned businesses are reluctant to list, fearing regulatory scrutiny and governance reforms that threaten their traditional control. As a result, Bangladesh\u2019s market capitalization has stagnated at around 20% of GDP.[7]\n\n## Formation\n\n[edit]Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) is a public limited company.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE)? The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), located in the Motijheel Park area of Dhaka, is one of two financial marketplaces in Bangladesh. The other is the Chittagong Stock Exchange. The DSE was incorporated in 1954 and began formal trading in 1956. Understanding the Dhaka Stock Exchange The Dhaka Stock Exchange endeavors to be the leading exchange in its region and a key driver of economic growth. As such, the DSE is proactive about keeping pace with technological advancements. The DSE initiated automated trading in 1998, and installed a central securities depository system in 2004. Since its inception, the Dhaka Stock Exchange has aspired to compete on the world stage of financial markets. It is cognizant of what it must do to persevere toward this goal and has set an ambitious schedule of objectives that it aims to fulfill in coming years, which include the following: Attracting more foreign investors in order to attain a steady level of at least 30% total market cap Achieving a sustainable average daily turnover of BDT 25 billion Ensuring steady domestic and offshore institutional investments of at least three-quarters of its total investments Enhancing its offerings by listing government municipal (munis), and corporate bonds Doubling its number of listed individual company securities Increasing its scope to offer index futures, exchange traded funds (ETFs), and derivatives Advancing its technology to enable global trading and settlement The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE): Background Originally, the DSE was called the East Pakistan Stock Exchange Association Ltd. In 1962, the name was revised to East Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd., and two years later, the name again changed to the current, Dhaka Stock Exchange Ltd. The Dhaka Stock Exchange is registered as a Public Limited Company (PLC) and is regulated by the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Ordinance of 1969, the Companies Act of 1994 (Bangladesh) and the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Act of 1993, which established oversight for the Dhaka Stock Exchange. As with the SEC in the United States, the Bangladesh SEC's responsibilities are broadly \"to protect the interest of investors in securities, develop the securities markets, and formulate rules on securities related matters.\" The Dhaka Stock Exchange trades in Bangladeshi taka, which is the currency of Bangladesh, and whose official International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 currency code is BDT. The taka was issued in 1972, replacing the Pakistani rupee at a ratio of one to one. Companies listed on the DSE are based primarily in Bangladesh. As of Oct. 13, 2021, the DSE\u2019s market capitalization in adjusted U.S. dollars was $67.11 billion. Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

It is a crossing of the Rio Grande that connects the cities of Rio Grande City, Texas and Camargo, Tamaulipas. The bridge is also known as the **Starr \u2013 Camargo Bridge** and, in Spanish, **Puente Camargo**. It is the southern terminus of Farm to Market Road 755.[1]\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]The two-lane steel girder bridge, which was completed and opened in 1966, is 591 feet (180 m) long. The bridge is owned and managed by the Starr Camargo Bridge Company based in Rio Grande City.[1]\n\nOn the U.S. side, the crossing connects with Pete Diaz Avenue and Bridge Avenue, which provides access to U.S. Route 83.[2] On the Mexican side the bridge connects with Carr Al Puente Internacional to Ciudad Camargo. Truckloads are restricted to 60 short tons (54,000 kg).\n\n## Border crossing\n\n[edit]The Rio Grande City Port of Entry is located at the Rio Grande City \u2013 Camargo International Bridge.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, a small ferry operation connected the cities of Camargo and Rio Grande City. Finally in 1966, a bridge was built by the Starr Camargo Bridge Company.[3] and a new border inspection station was built at that time. The station was upgraded in 2000.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a**\"Rio Grande City-Camargo Bridge\". Texas Department of Transportation.

There are six major Shona language\/dialect clusters: **Manyika**, **Karanga**, **Zezuru**, **Korekore**, **Kalanga**, and **Ndau.**\n\n\n\n## Classification\n\n[edit]The Shona people are grouped according to the dialect of the language they speak. Their estimated population is 22.6 million:[7][8]\n\n- Korekore (northern region of Zimbabwe)\n- Zezuru (central Zimbabwe)\n- Manyika (eastern Zimbabwe around Mutare, Buhera, Nyanga and into Mozambique)\n- Ndau (southeast Zimbabwe around Mutare, Chimanimani, Chipinge and into Mozambique)\n- Karanga (south-central Zimbabwe around Masvingo)\n- Kalanga (southwest Zimbabwe, interspersed with the Ndebele)\n\n## History\n\n[edit]During the 11th century, the Karanga people formed kingdoms on the Zimbabwe plateau. Construction, then, began on Great Zimbabwe; the capital of the kingdom of Zimbabwe. The Torwa dynasty ruled the kingdom of Butua, and the kingdom of Mutapa preceded the Rozvi Empire (which lasted into the 19th century).\n\nBrother succeeded brother in the dynasties, leading to[ clarification needed] civil wars which were exploited by the Portuguese during the 16th century. The kings ruled several chiefs, sub-chiefs and headmen.\n\n[9]\n\nThe kingdoms were replaced by new groups who moved onto the plateau. The Ndebele destroyed the weakened Rozvi Empire during the 1830s; the Portuguese gradually encroached on the kingdom of Mutapa, which extended to the Mozambique coast after it provided valued exports (particularly gold) for Swahili, Arab and East Asian traders. The Pioneer Column of the British South Africa Company established the colony of Rhodesia, sparking the First Matabele War which led to the complete annexation of Mashonaland; the Portuguese colonial government in Mozambique fought the remnants of the kingdom of Mutapa until 1911. The Shona people were also a part of the Bantu migration where they are one of the largest Bantu ethnic groups in Sub-Saharan Africa.[9]\n\n## Language\n\n[edit]The dialect groups of Shona developed among dispersed tribes over a long time and further groups of immigrants have contributed to this diversity. Although \"standard\" Shona is spoken throughout Zimbabwe, dialects help identify a speaker's town or village. Each Shona dialect is specific to a sub-group.\n\nIn 1931, during his attempt to reconcile the dialects into a single standard Shona language, Clement Doke identified five groups and subdivisions:[10]\n\n- The\n**Manyika**group, including Hungwe, Manyika themselves, Te\u03c5e, Unyama, Karombe, Nyamuka, Bunji, Domba, Nyatwe, Guta, Bvumba, Hera, Ajindwi, and Abocha - The\n**Korekore**including Ta\u03c5ara, Shangwe, Korekore, Go\u03c5a, Budya, the Korekore of Urungwe, the Korekore of Sipolilo, Tande, Nyongwe of \"Darwin\", and Pfungwe of Mrewa - The\n**Zezuru**group, including Shawasha, Hara\u03c5a, another Go\u03c5a, Nohwe, Njanja, Mbire, Nobvu, Vakwachikwakwa, Vakwazvimba, Tsunga - The\n**Karanga**group, including Duma, Jena, Mari, Go\u03c5era, Nogo\u03c5a, and Nyubi - The\n**Ndau**group (mostly in Mozambique), including Ndau, Garwe, Danda, and Shanga[*citation needed*]\n\nThe Ndau dialect, which is somewhat mutually intelligible with the main Shona dialects, has click sounds which do not occur in standard Shona. Ndau has a wealth of Nguni words as a result of the Gaza Nguni occupation of their ancestral land in the 19th century.[11]\n\n## Economics\n\n[edit]### Agriculture\n\n[edit]The Shona have traditionally practiced subsistence agriculture. They grew sorghum, beans, African groundnuts, and after the Columbian Exchange, pumpkins. Sorghum was largely replaced by maize after the crop's introduction.[12] The Shona also keep cattle and goats, since livestock are an important food reserve during droughts.[9]\n\n### Mining\n\n[edit]Precolonial Shona states derived substantial revenue from the export of mining products, particularly gold and copper.[9]\n\n## Culture\n\n[edit]### Clothing\n\n[edit]Traditional clothing was usually animal skins that covered the front and the back, and was called 'M*hapa'* and 'S*hashiko'.*[ citation needed] These later evolved when the Shona people started trading for cloth with other groups, such as the Tsonga, and native cloths began to be manufactured.\n\n[\n\n*citation needed*]### Music\n\n[edit]Shona traditional music's most important instruments are Ngoma drums and the Mbira. The drums vary in size and shape, depending on the type of music they are accompanying. How they are played also depends on drum size and music type. Large drums are typically played with sticks, and smaller drums with an open palm; the small drum used for the A**mabhiza** dance is played with a hand and a stick. The stick rubs, or scratches, the drum to produce a screeching sound.[13]\n\nThe mbira has become a national instrument of sorts in Zimbabwe.[14] It has several variants, including the Nhare, Mbira Dzavadzimu, the Mbira Nyunga Nyunga, Njari Mbira, and Matepe. The Mbira is played at religious and secular gatherings, and different Mbiras have different purposes. The 22\u201324-key Mbira Dzavadzimu is used to summon spirits, and the 15-key Mbira Nyunga Nyunga is taught from primary school to university.[15] Shona music also uses percussion instruments such as the Marimba (similar to a Xylophone), shakers (*'Hosho*'), leg rattles, wooden clappers ('M*akwa'*), and the 'C*hikorodzi*,' a notched stick played with another stick.[16]\n\n### Arts\n\n[edit]Both historically and in contemporary art, the Shona are known for their work in stone sculpture, which re-emerged during the 1940s. Shona sculpture developed during the eleventh century and peaked in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, before beginning a slow decline until their mid-20th-century rediscovery.[17] Most of the sculptures are made from sedimentary stone (such as Soapstone) and depict birds or humans; though some are made with harder stone such as serpentinite. During the 1950s, Zimbabwean artists began carving stone sculptures for sale to European art collectors; these sculptures quickly became popular and were bought and exhibited at art museums around the world.[ citation needed] Many of the sculptures depict the transformation of spirits into animals or vice versa, and some are more abstract. Many Zimbabwean artists carve wood and stone to sell to tourists.\n\nPottery is also a traditionally practiced craft, with the storage and serving pots being the most decorative, contrasted with those used for cooking. In Shona clay earthenware pots are known as H*ari*.[ citation needed]\n\n### Architecture\n\n[edit]Traditional Shona housing (*Musha*) are round huts arranged around a cleared yard (*Ruvanze*). Each hut has a specific function, such as acting as a kitchen or a lounge.[18] Also, Shona architecture consists of drystone walling that goes back to the ancestors of modern-day Shona people and also Kalanga and Venda peoples. This drystone walling consists of drystone walls, drystone walled stairs on hilltops and free-standing drystone walls known as great Zimbabwe-type drystone walling (examples: Great Zimbabwe, Chisvingo). Then there are additional types of drystone walling that the Shona people did in Rozvi state that is platform terraces drystone walling. In the eastern province of Zimbabwe there is ziwa-type drystone walling with cattle crawls for an indigenous African species of cattle that still exists today and underground homes with drystone walled verandas.\n\n### Cuisine\n\n[edit]Sorghum and maize are used to prepare the staple dish, a thickened porridge (*Sadza*), and the traditional beer known as H*wahwa*.[19] Beef is found to be a staple in Shona people's diet due to cattle rearing being very prominent in Zimbabwe. Historically, the wealthy royals would be able to eat beef on a regular (more than three times a week), usually dried; and commoners would eat beef at least once a week, also dried. Cattle was a prized resource, normally reserved for other products like milk. Preserved milk was consumed with Sadza, at the time made by Sorghum. At present, beef is consumed normally mixed with greens, Kale being the most commonly used.\n\n### Religion\n\n[edit]#### Shona religion\n\n[edit]\nThe traditional religion of the Shona people is centred on *Mwari* (God), also known as *Musikavanhu* (Creator of man\/people) or *Nyadenga* (one who lives high up). God communicates with his people on earth directly or through *chosen family members in each family believed to be holy*. At times God uses natural phenomena and the environment to communicate with his people. Some of the chosen people have powers to prophesy, heal and bless. People can also communicate with God directly through prayer. Deaths are not losses but a promotion to the stage where they can represent the living through the clan spirits. When someone dies, according to the Shona religion, they join the spiritual world. In the spiritual world, they can enjoy their afterlife or become bad spirits. No one wants to be a bad spirit, so during life, people are guided by a culture of Unhu so that when they die, they enjoy their afterlife. The Bira ceremony, which often lasts all night, summons spirits for guidance and intercession. Shona religion teaches that the only ones who can communicate with both the living and God are the ancestral spirits or D*zavadzimu*.\n\nHistorically, colonialists and anthropologists wanted to undermine the Shona religion in favour of Christianity. Initially, they stated that Shona did not have a God. They denigrated the way the Shona had communicated with their God *Mwari*, the Shona way of worship, and *chosen people* among the Shona. The chosen people were treated as unholy and Shona prayer was labelled as pagan. When compared with Christianity, the Shona religious perspective of afterlife, holiness, worship and rules of life (*unhu*) are similar.[20]\n\n#### Religious affiliation of Shona peoples\n\n[edit]Although sixty to eighty percent of the Shona people follow Christianity, Shona traditional religious beliefs are still present across the country. A small number of the population practice the Muslim faith, often brought about by immigrants from predominantly Malawi who practice Islam. There is also a small population of Jews.\n\n### Mitupo identity emblems\n\n[edit]In Zimbabwe, the *Mitupo* (translated as totems by colonial missionaries and anthropologists, a term which neglects the organizational system) is a system of identifying clans and sub-clans, which are named after and signified by emblems, commonly Indigenous animals or animal body parts. *Mitupo* (the plural of *Mutupo* singular) has been used by the Shona people since the Shona culture developed. They have provided a function in avoiding incest, and also build solidarity and identity. They could be compared to heraldry in European culture. There are more than 25 *Mitupo* in Zimbabwe. In marriage, *Mitupo* helps create a strong identity for children but it serves another function of ensuring that people marry someone they know. In Shona, this is explained by the proverb *Rooranai Vematongo* which means 'marry or have a relationship with someone that you know'. However, as a result of colonisation, urban areas and migration resulted in people mixing and others having relationships of convenience with people they do not know. This results in unwanted pregnancies and also unwanted babies some of whom are dumped or abandoned.[ citation needed] This may end up with children without\n\n*Mutupo*. This phenomenon has resulted in numerous challenges for communities but also for the children who lack part of their identity. It is, however, possible for a child to be adopted and receive a\n\n*mutupo*.\n\n[21]\n\n[22]\n\n## Genetics\n\n[edit]The Shona people, like many other Bantu-speaking groups in southern and central Africa, do not exhibit evidence of Eurasian DNA. Genetic analyses of ancient remains from regions such as Zimbabwe have not identified archaic Eurasian DNA markers. These findings challenge earlier theories that underestimated the capabilities of African communities.\n\nFor instance, a study analyzing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variability in Bantu-speaking populations, including the Shona from Zimbabwe, found no significant Eurasian genetic influence.

He is nicknamed \"The Lion of Zimbabwe\" and \"Mukanya\" (the praise name of his clan in the Shona language) for his immense popularity and for the political influence he wields through his music, including his sharp criticism of the government of former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. He both created and popularized Chimurenga music, and is known for his distinctive voice and slow-moving style.\n\nMapfumo was imprisoned without charges under the white-dominated regime of Rhodesia, and he was hounded by the Mugabe government of Zimbabwe that succeeded it. He lived in exile in the United States for two decades,[2] and in April 2018, returned to Zimbabwe for the first time since 2005 to perform a concert.[3][4]\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]Mapfumo was born in 1945 in Marondera, Mashonaland East,[5] a town southeast of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, though at the time the capital was called Salisbury and the country was a colony of Great Britain called Southern Rhodesia (becoming Rhodesia in ordinary usage after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). He lived a traditional, rural Shona lifestyle until the age of ten, when his family moved to the Harare township of Mbare.[5] It was during these early years that he was exposed to the traditional music of the Shona, the influence of which would drive his later music to incorporate and\/or reflect the sounds of the ngoma drum and the mbira, a metal-pronged instrument with spiritual importance.[6]\n\n## Early career\n\n[edit]He joined his first band, the Zutu Brothers (although, *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica* says it was the Cyclones), as a singer at the age of 16. From then he was always in one band or another, such as The Wagon Wheels with Afro jazz musician Oliver Mtukudzi and guitarist James Chimombe sometimes doing odd jobs on the side as well, including chicken farming. Hence the name of his 1972 band, the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band.[5]\n\nHe played mostly covers of American rock and soul tunes, such as Otis Redding or Elvis Presley, until he was in the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band.[5] There he introduced the innovation of adapting traditional Shona music to modern rock instrumentation.[5]\n\nHe worked with guitarist Joshua Dube (Leopard Man's *Africa Music Guide* says Jonah Sithole) to transcribe the sounds of the chief instrument of traditional Shona music, the mbira to the electric guitar. He also started singing primarily in the Shona language, rather than in English. Joshua Dube started to experiment mbira on guitar on Take One recorded in 1974 [5]\n\n## Political undertones\n\n[edit]Simply drawing on the native musical tradition and singing in his native language was a political statement. Rhodesia was ruled by a minority of white individuals who derogated the native black population and culture. But more than that, his lyrics became overtly political, supporting the revolution that was developing in the rural areas, what the Rhodesian government called \"the communal lands\". He called his new style of music Chimurenga. In Shona it is derived from one of the architects of the first Black Uprising of 1896 called Murenga, and is the name of the wars of liberation in both the late 19th century and the bush war from 1960s up to the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979. His songs openly called for the violent overthrow of the government, with lyrics like \"Mothers, send your sons to war.\"[7]\n\n## Political overtones\n\n[edit]Mapfumo's music caught the attention of the Rhodesian government with his song \"Hokoyo!\", meaning \"Watch out!\"[5] The government banned the record from the state-controlled radio and threw him into a prison camp without charges in 1979. They were unable to stop his records from being played in discos or on radio stations they did not control, including the Voice of Mozambique.[5] Large demonstrations in protest of his arrest and an inability to find charges against him forced the government to release him after three months.[5]\n\nFree elections were held in 1980, and a new government was installed. Mapfumo performed at a celebratory concert that also featured Bob Marley. In later years, he would come to criticize the same government he, in some ways, helped bring to power.[6]\n\nThe PRI-syndicated radio program Afropop Worldwide ran a feature on Thomas Mapfumo in late 1988\/early 1989. Host Georges Collinet describes Mapfumo as living in the low-density suburbs with his wife, who worked at a law office in downtown Harare, and his two children\u2014a boy and a girl. And he drove a blue Ford with fake leopard-skin seat covers.\n\nMost of his songs were still political, dealing with poverty and other social issues. Mapfumo comments on the fact that he does not sing many love songs: \"All you need if you wanna get into the bedroom... You've got a wife. You do it. You don't have to sing a song about it.\" Collinet also observes that Mapfumo can not sing anything he wants: \"Clearly he can't sing 'Down with President Mugabe' \u2013 but he wouldn't want to. He supports the present government.\" However, that would soon change.\n\nRecorded at Shed Studios in Harare, by long-time engineer Benny Miller, Mapfumo released the album *Corruption* in 1989.[5] It criticised Mugabe and his government, with which Mapfumo was becoming more and more disillusioned. Mugabe was not happy with Mapfumo, either, and Mapfumo became the target of government harassment. Mapfumo was accused of being involved with a stolen-car ring. Things got uncomfortable enough that Mapfumo moved to Eugene, Oregon in the late 1990s. After Mugabe's overthrow in 2017, he returned to Zimbabwe, to a massive show named 'Homecoming Bira' at Glamis Arena in Harare on April 28, 2018. The homecoming show proved that Mapfumo was out of political danger, and he returned for more shows in many parts of Zimbabwe between December 2018 and March 2019. He returned to his United States base after the four-month visit to Zimbabwe.\n\nThomas Mapfumo tours internationally, and still sings and speaks out about the problems of Zimbabwe. His Chimurenga style of music influenced other Zimbabwean musicians, including the Bhundu Boys and Stella Chiweshe.\n\n## Discography\n\n[edit]*Shumba*(1990, Earthworks)\n\n### Thomas Mapfumo and the Acid Band\n\n[edit]*Hokoyo!*(1978, Chimurenga Music)\n\n### Thomas Mapfumo & the Blacks Unlimited\n\n[edit]*Gwindingwi Rine Shumba*(1981, Chimurenga Music)*Mabasa*(1983, Chimurenga Music, Gramma Records)*Ndangariro*(1983, Afro Soul)*Chimurenga For Justice*(1985, Rough Trade)*Mr Music (Africa)*(1985, Afro Soul)*Zimbabwe Mozambique*(1988, Chimurenga Music)*Chamunorwa*(1989, Chimurenga Music)*Varombo Kuvarombo*(1989, Chimurenga Music)*Corruption*(1989, Mango)*Chimurenga Masterpiece*(1990, Chimurenga Music)*Hondo*(1991, Chimurenga Music)*Chimurenga International*(1993, Chimurenga Music)*Chimurenga Varieties*(1994, Chimurenga Music)*Roots Chimurenga*(1996, Chimurenga Music)*Sweet Chimurenga*(1996, Chimurenga Music)*Afro Chimurenga*(1996, Chimurenga Music)*Chimurenga '98*(1998, Anonymous Web Productions)*Live at El Rey*(1999, Anonymous Web Productions)*Chimurenga Explosion*(2000, Anonymous Web Productions)*Chimurenga Unlimited Hits Vol 1*( 2007, Chimurenga Music)- Chimurenga Rebel (2002, Anonymous Web Productions)\n*Chimurenga Unlimited Hits Vol 2**Chimurenga Unlimited Vol 3**Toi Toi*(2003)*Rise Up*(2005, digital download; 2006, Real World Records)- Exile (2010, Sheer Sound)\n- Danger Zone (2015, Chimurenga Music Company)\n*Live @ The Sanctuary for Independent Media*(2016, Chimurenga Music)*Ndikutambire*(2023, Chimurenga Music Company)c\n\n### Compilation appearances\n\n[edit]*The Rough Guide to the Music of Zimbabwe*(1996, World Music Network)*Roots Rocking Zimbabwe: The Modern Sound of Harare' Townships 1975\u20131980*(2025, Analog Africa No.41)\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Thomas Mapfumo: Biography\".*World Music Central*.

It is a syncretic genre that blends elements of Spanish and African origin. Among its fundamental Hispanic components are the vocal style, lyrical metre and the primacy of the tres, derived from the Spanish guitar. On the other hand, its characteristic clave rhythm, call and response structure and percussion section (bongo, maracas, etc.) are all rooted in traditions of Bantu origin.[1]\n\nAround 1909 the son reached Havana, where the first recordings were made in 1917.[2] This marked the start of its expansion throughout the island, becoming Cuba's most popular and influential genre.[3] While early groups had between three and five members, during the 1920s the *sexteto* (sextet) became the genre's primary format. By the 1930s, many bands had incorporated a trumpet, becoming *septetos*, and in the 1940s a larger type of ensemble featuring congas and piano became the norm: the conjunto. The son became one of the main ingredients in the jam sessions known as descargas that flourished during the 1950s.\n\nThe international presence of the son can be traced back to the 1930s when many bands toured Europe and North America, leading to ballroom adaptations of the genre such as the American rhumba. Similarly, radio broadcasts of son became popular in West Africa and the Congos, leading to the development of hybrid genres such as Congolese rumba. In the 1960s, New York's music scene prompted the rapid success of salsa, a combination of son and other Latin American styles primarily recorded by Puerto Ricans. While salsa achieved international popularity during the second half of the 20th century, in Cuba son evolved into other styles such as songo and timba, the latter of which is sometimes known as \"Cuban salsa\".\n\n## Etymology and cognates\n\n[edit]In Spanish, the word *son*, from Latin *sonus*, denotes a pleasant sound, particularly a musical one.[4] In eastern Cuba, the term began to be used to refer to the music of the highlands towards the late 19th century. To distinguish it from similar genres from other countries (such as son mexicano and son guatemalteco), the term *son cubano* is most commonly used. In Cuba, various qualifiers are used to distinguish the regional variants of the genre. These include *son montuno*, *son oriental*, *son santiaguero* and *son habanero*.[2]\n\nSon singers are generally known as *soneros*, and the verb *sonear* describes not only their singing but also their vocal improvisation.[5] The adjective *soneado* refers to songs and styles which incorporate the tempo and syncopation of the son, or even its montunos. Generally, there is an explicit difference between styles that incorporate elements of the son partially or totally, as evidenced by the distinction between *bolero soneado* and *bolero-son*.[6][7] The term *sonora* refers to conjuntos with smoother trumpet sections such as Sonora Matancera and Sonora Ponce\u00f1a.[8]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Origins\n\n[edit]Although the history of Cuban music dates back to the 16th century, the son is a relatively recent musical invention whose precursors emerged in the mid-to-late 19th century. Historically, most musicologists have supported the hypothesis that the direct ancestors (or earliest forms) of the son appeared in Cuba's Oriente Province, particularly in mountainous regions such as Sierra Maestra.[2] These early styles, which include chang\u00fc\u00ed, neng\u00f3n, kirib\u00e1 and regina,[9] were developed by peasants, many of which were of Bantu origin, in contrast to the Afro-Cubans of the western side of the island, which primarily descended from West African slaves (Yoruba, Ewe, etc.).[1] These forms flourished in the context of rural parties such as *guateques*, where *bungas* were known to perform; these groups consisted of singers and guitarists playing variants such as the tiple, bandurria and bandola.[10] Such early guitars are thought to have given rise to the tres some time around 1890 in Baracoa.[11] The addition of a rhythm section composed of percussion instruments such as the bong\u00f3 and the botija\/mar\u00edmbula gave rise to the first son groups proper.[12] Nonetheless, it has become increasingly clear for musicologists that different versions of the son, i.e. styles that fall within the so-called **son complex**, appeared throughout the rural parts of the island by the end of the 1890s.[13] Musicologist Marta Esquenazi P\u00e9rez divides the son complex into three regional variants: chang\u00fc\u00ed in Guant\u00e1namo, sucu-sucu in Isla de la Juventud, and an array of styles which fall under the denomination of son montuno and were developed in places such as Bayamo, Manzanillo, Majagua and Pinar del R\u00edo.[14] For this reason, some academics such as Radam\u00e9s Giro and Jes\u00fas G\u00f3mez Cairo indicate that awareness of the son was widespread in the whole island, including Havana, before the actual expansion of the genre in the 1910s.[15][16]\n\nMusicologist Peter Manuel proposed an alternative hypothesis according to which a great deal of the son's structure originated from the contradanza in Havana around the second half of the 19th century. The contradanza included many of the traits that are shown in the son, such as duets with melodies in parallel thirds, the presence of a suggested clave rhythm, implicit short vocal refrains borrowed from popular songs, distinctive syncopations, as well as the two-parts song form with an ostinato section.[17]\n\n#### Apocryphal origins of the son\n\n[edit]Due to the very limited historiographical and ethnomusicological research devoted to the son (considered by D\u00edaz Ayala the \"least studied\" Cuban genre),[2] until the mid-20th century its origins were incorrectly traced back to the 16th century by many writers. This fallacy stemmed from the apocryphal origin story of a folk song known as \"Son de M\u00e1 Teodora\". Such story was first mentioned by Cuban historian Joaqu\u00edn Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda in 1845, who \"cited\" a chronicle supposedly written by Hernando de la Parra in the 16th century. Parra's story was picked up, recycled and expanded by various authors throughout the second half of the 19th century, perpetuating the idea that such song was the first example of the son genre. Despite being given credence by some authors in the first half of the 20th century, including Fernando Ortiz, the *Cr\u00f3nicas* were repeatedly shown to be apocryphal in subsequent studies by Manuel P\u00e9rez Beato, Jos\u00e9 Juan Arrom, Max Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a and Alberto Muguercia.[18]\n\n### Early 20th century\n\n[edit]The emergence of son significantly increased the interaction of cultures derived from Africa and Spain. A large number of former black slaves, recently liberated after the abolition of slavery in 1886 went to live in the slums \"solares\" of low class neighborhoods in Havana, and numerous laborers also arrived from all over the country and some rural areas, looking to improve their living conditions. Many of them brought their Afro-Cuban rumba traditions, and others brought their rumbitas and montunos.\n\nIt was in Havana where the encounter of the rumba rural and the rumba urbana that had been developing separately during the second half of the 19th century took place. The guaracheros and rumberos who used to play with the tiple and the guiro finally met other rumberos who sang and danced accompanied by the wooden box (caj\u00f3n) and the Cuban clave, and the result was the fusion of both styles in a new genre called son.[19] Around 1910 the son most likely adopted the clave rhythm from the Havana-based rumba, which had been developed in the late 19th century in Havana and Matanzas.[20]\n\nAfter trovador Sindo Garay settled in Havana in 1906, many other trovadores followed him hoping to obtain a recording contract with one of the American Companies such as RCA Victor and Columbia Records. Those trovadores from different parts of the country met others who already lived in Havana such as Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera and Rafael Zequeira. They brought their repertoires of canciones (Cuban songs) and boleros that also included rumbas, guarachas and rural rumbitas.\n\nFamous trovador Chico Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez said that he composed his first \"montuno\" called \"Pobre Evaristo\" (Poor Evaristo) in 1906: \"It was a tonada with three or four words that you put on, and after it, we placed a repeated phrase, the real montuno to be sung by everybody\u2026\".[21] Ned Sublette states about another famous trovador and sonero: \"As a child, Miguel Matamoros played danzones and sones on his harmonica to entertain the workers at a local cigar factory. He said: 'the sones that were composed at that time were nothing more than two or three words that were repeated all night long.'\"[22]\n\nA partial list of trovadores that recorded rumbas, guarachas and sones in Havana at the beginning of the 20th century included: Sindo Garay, Manuel Corona, Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera, Alberto Villal\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Castillo, Juan Cruz, Juan de la Cruz, Nano Le\u00f3n, Rom\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, as well as the duos of Floro and Zorrilla, Pablito and Luna, Zalazar and Oriche, and also Adolfo Colombo, who was not a trovador but a soloist at Teatro Alhambra.[23]\n\nIn the Havana neighborhoods, the son groups played in any possible format they could gather and most of them were semi-professional. One of those groups, The Apaches, was invited in 1916 to a party held by President Mario Menocal at the exclusive Vedado Tennis Club, and that same year some members of the group were reorganized in a quartet named Cuarteto Oriental.[24] Those members were: Ricardo Mart\u00ednez from Santiago de Cuba (conductor and tres), Gerardo Mart\u00ednez (first voice and clave), Guillermo Castillo (botijuela), and Felipe Neri Cabrera (maracas). According to Jes\u00fas Blanco, quoted by D\u00edaz Ayala, after a few months from its foundation the bongocero Joaqu\u00edn Velazco joined the group.[25]\n\nIn 1917, the Cuarteto Oriental recorded the first son documented on the catalog of Columbia Records which was entered as \"Pare motorista-son santiaguero\". Unexpectedly, a fifth member of the quartet is mentioned, Carlos God\u00ednez, who was a soldier in the standing army (*Ej\u00e9rcito Permanente*). Subsequently, the RCA Victor contracted God\u00ednez in 1918 to organize a group and record several songs. For that recording, the new group was called \"Sexteto Habanero God\u00ednez\", which included: Carlos God\u00ednez (conductor and tresero), Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera (first voice and clave), Manuel Corona (second voice and guitar), Sinsonte (third voice and maracas), Alfredo Bolo\u00f1a (bongo), and another unknown performer who was not included in the list.[26]\n\n### 1920s\n\n[edit]In 1920, the Cuarteto Oriental became a sextet and was renamed as Sexteto Habanero. This group established the \"classical\" configuration of the son sextet composed of guitar, tres, bongos, claves, maracas and double bass.[27] The sextet members were: Guillermo Castillo (conductor, guitar and second voice), Gerardo Mart\u00ednez (first voice), Felipe Neri Cabrera (maracas and backing vocals), Ricardo Mart\u00ednez (tres), Joaqu\u00edn Velazco (bongos), and Antonio Bacallao (botija). Abelardo Barroso, one of the most famous soneros, joined the group in 1925.[28]\n\nPopularization began in earnest with the arrival of radio broadcasting in 1922, which came at the same time as Havana's reputation as an attraction for Americans evading Prohibition laws. The city became a haven for the Mafia, gambling and prostitution in Cuba, and also became a second home for trendy and influential bands from New York City. The son experienced a period of transformation from 1925 to 1928, when it evolved from a marginal genre of music to perhaps the most popular type of music in Cuba.\n\nA turning point that made this transformation possible occurred when then-president Machado publicly asked La Sonora Matancera to perform at his birthday party. In addition, the acceptance of son as a popular music genre in other countries contributed to more acceptance of son in mainstream Cuba.[29] At that time many sextets were founded such as Bolo\u00f1a, Agabama, Bot\u00f3n de Rosa and the famous Sexteto Occidente conducted by Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera.[28]\n\nA few years later, in the late 1920s, son sextets became septets and son's popularity continued to grow with artists like Septeto Nacional and its leader Ignacio Pi\u00f1eiro (\"Echale salsita\", \"Donde estabas anoche\"). In 1928, Rita Montaner's \"El Manicero\" became the first Cuban song to be a major hit in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. In 1930, Don Azpiazu's Havana Casino Orchestra took the song to the United States, where it also became a big hit.\n\nThe instrumentation was expanded to include cornets or trumpets, forming the sextets and the septets of the 1920s. Later these conjuntos added piano, other percussion instruments, more trumpets, and even dance orchestra instruments in the style of jazz big bands.[30]\n\n### Tr\u00edo Matamoros\n\n[edit]The presence of the Tr\u00edo Matamoros in the history of Cuban son is so important that it deserves a separate section. Its development constitutes an example of the process that the trovadores usually followed until they became soneros. The Tr\u00edo was founded by Miguel Matamoros (vocals and first guitar), who was born in Santiago de Cuba (Oriente) in 1894. There, he became involved with the traditional trova movement and in 1925 joined Siro Rodr\u00edguez (vocals and maracas) and Rafael Cueto (vocals and second guitar) to create the famous group.[31]\n\nThey synthesized the style of the sextets and septets, adapting it to their ensemble. The different rhythmic layers of the son style were distributed between their three voices, guitars and maracas. Cueto plucked the strings of his guitar instead of strumming them as it was usual, providing the patterns of the guajeo in the treble range, and the syncopated rhythms of the tumbao on the bass strings. The counterpoint was completed by the first guitar, played by Matamoros.[32] They also occasionally included other instruments such as the bongo, and later they decided to expand the trio format to create a son conjunto by adding a piano, more guitars, tres and other voices. This project was joined by such important figures as Lorenzo Hierrezuelo, Francisco Repilado (Compay Segundo) and Beny Mor\u00e9.\n\nIn 1928, they travelled to New York with a recording contract by RCA Victor, and their first album caused such a great impact in the public that they soon became very famous at a national as well as an international level. The Tr\u00edo Matamoros maintained great prominence until their official retirement in 1960.[28]\n\n### 1930s\n\n[edit]By the late 1930s, the heyday of \"Classic son\" had largely ended. The sextetos and septetos that had enjoyed wide commercial popularity increasingly lost ground to jazz bands and amplified conjuntos.[33] The very music that son had helped to create was now replacing son as the more popular and most requested music in Cuba. Original son conjuntos were faced with the options of either to disband and refocus on newer styles of Cuban music, or go back to their roots.\n\n### 1940s\n\n[edit]In the 1940s, Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez became the most influential player of son. He used improvised solos, toques, congas, extra trumpets, percussion and pianos, although all these elements had been used previously (\"Papauba\", \"Para bailar son montuno\"). Beny Mor\u00e9 (known as *El B\u00e1rbaro del Ritmo*, \"The Master of Rhythm\") further evolved the genre, adding guaracha, bolero and mambo influences. He was perhaps the greatest sonero (\"Castellano que bueno baila usted\", \"Vertiente Camaguey\"); another important sonero was Roberto Faz.\n\nBy the late 1940s, son had lost its controversiality even among conservative Cubans which made it even less appealing to Cubans.[34] A development that led to the decrease in popularity of the original son occurred in the 1940s. The son grew more sophisticated as it was adopted by conjuntos, which displaced sextetos and septetos. This led to big bands replacing the conjuntos, which managed to keep its flavor despite elaborate arrangements.[35]\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the tourism boom in Cuba and the popularity of jazz and American music in general fostered the development of big bands and combos on the island. These bands consisted of a relatively small horn section, piano, double bass, a full array of Cuban percussion instruments and a vocalist fronting the ensemble. Their polished sound and \"cosmopolitan\" \u2013 read \"commercial\" \u2013 repertoire captivated both Cuban and foreign audiences.\n\nThe commercialism of this new music movement led Cuban nightclub owners to recognize the revenue potential of hosting these types of bands to attract the growing flow of tourists. Additionally, as a result of the increasing popularity of big band music and in an effort to increase revenues, the recording industry focused on producing newer types of music and essentially removing son from their music repertoires. These developments were a big blow to the prospects of son and its popularity amongst even Cubans.\n\nWith the arrival of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 and mambo in the United States, son also became extremely popular. After the Cuban Revolution separated Cuba from the U.S., son, mambo and rumba, along with other forms of Afro-Cuban music contributed to the development of salsa music, initially in New York.[36]\n\nThe mass popularization of son music led to an increased valorization of Afro-Cuban street culture and of the artists who created it. It also opened the door for other music genres with Afro-Cuban roots to become popular in Cuba and throughout the world.[33]\n\n### Current state of the son\n\n[edit]At present, the traditional-style son is seldom heard but has been assimilated into other genres and is present in them. Thus, other types of popular Cuban music and other Latin styles of music continue using the essential style of the son.[37]\n\nAnother important contribution of the son was the introduction of the drum to mainstream music. The increase in popularity of the son unveiled the potential of music with Afro-Cuban rhythms. This led to the development and mass distribution of newer types of Latin music. Additionally, genres of the later 1940s such as mambo manifest many characteristics derived from son. Charanga orchestras, also developed dance music heavily influenced by son.[34]\n\nPerhaps the most significant contribution of son is its influence on present day Latin music. Son is specifically considered to be the foundation on which salsa was created.[38]\n\nAlthough the \"classic son\" continues to be a very important musical foundation for all kinds of Latin music, it is no longer a popular music genre in Cuba. Younger generations of Cubans prefer the faster, dance-oriented son-derivatives such as timba or salsa. Older generations continue to preserve the son as one of the music genres they listen to, specifically in Oriente, where they tend to maintain more traditional versions of the son compared to Havana.[39]\n\nThe demise of the USSR (Cuba's major economic mainstay) in 1991 forced Cuba to encourage tourism to attract sorely needed foreign currency. Along with tourism, music became one of Cuba's major assets. The Buena Vista Social Club album and film as well as a stream of CDs triggered a worldwide Cuban music boom.[40] In addition to the original Buena Vista Social Club album, there has been a stream of solo CDs by the members of the \"Club\". These individuals were subsequently offered individual contracts, ensuring a continued flow of\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paquito_D%27Rivera\n# Paquito D'Rivera\n\n\nPaquito D'Rivera | |\n|---|---|\n| Background information | |\n| Born | Francisco de Jes\u00fas Rivera Figueras 4 June 1948 |\n| Genres | Afro-Cuban jazz, songo, classical |\n| Occupations | Musician, composer, bandleader |\n| Instruments | Alto saxophone, clarinet |\n| Years active | 1965\u2013present |\n| Labels | Sunnyside, Paquito Records |\n| Website | paquitodrivera |\n\n**Francisco de Jes\u00fas Rivera Figueras** (born 4 June 1948), known as **Paquito D'Rivera**, is a Cuban-American alto saxophonist, clarinetist and composer. He was a member of the Cuban songo band Irakere and, since the 1980s, he has established himself as a bandleader in the United States. His smooth saxophone tone and his frequent combination of Latin jazz and classical music have become his trademarks.[1]\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]Francisco de Jes\u00fas Rivera Figueras was born on 4 June 1948 in Havana, Cuba.[2] His father played classical saxophone, entertained his son with Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman records and sold musical instruments. He took D'Rivera to clubs like the Tropicana (frequented by his musician friends and customers) and to concert bands and orchestras.[3]\n\nAt age five, D'Rivera began saxophone lessons by his father Francisco Lorenzo Rivera Sanchez (tito). In 1960, he attended Alejandro Garcia Caturla Conservatory of Music, where he learned saxophone and clarinet In 1965, he was a featured soloist with the Cuban National Symphony Orchestra. He and Vald\u00e9s founded Orchestra Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna and then in 1973 the group Irakere, which fused jazz, rock, classical, and Cuban music.\n\n## Defection\n\n[edit]By 1980, D'Rivera had become dissatisfied with the constraints placed on his music in Cuba for many years. In an interview with ReasonTV, D'Rivera recalled that the Cuban communist government described jazz and rock and roll as \"imperialist\" music that was officially discouraged in the 1960s\/70s, and that a meeting with Che Guevara sparked his desire to leave Cuba.[4] In early 1980, while on tour in Spain, he sought asylum with the American Embassy, leaving his wife and child and brother Enrique, who is also a saxophonist, behind, with a promise to bring them out of Cuba. He fulfilled that promise nine years later.[5]\n\nUpon his arrival in the United States, D'Rivera found great support for him and his family. His mother, Maura, and his sister, Rosario, had left Cuba in 1968 and became US citizens. Maura had worked in the US in the fashion industry for many years, and Rosario had become a respected artist and entrepreneur. Paquito was introduced to the jazz scene at some prestigious clubs and concert halls in New York. He became something of a phenomenon after the release of his first two solo albums, *Paquito Blowin' * (June 1981) and *Mariel* (July 1982).[6]\n\nIn 2005, D'Rivera wrote a letter criticizing musician Carlos Santana for his decision to wear a T-shirt with the image of Che Guevara on it to the 2005 Academy Awards, citing Guevara's role in the execution of counter-revolutionaries in Cuba, including his own cousin.[7]\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]D'Rivera has performed in venues such as Carnegie Hall and played with the National Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Florida Philharmonic Orchestra, Bronx Arts Ensemble, Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra, YOA Orchestra of the Americas, Costa Rica National Symphony, American Youth Philharmonic, and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra.[8][9]\n\nThroughout his career in the United States, D'Rivera's albums have received reviews from critics and have hit the top of the jazz charts. His albums have shown a progression that demonstrates his extraordinary abilities in bebop, classical and Latin\/Caribbean music. D'Rivera's expertise transcends musical genres as he is the only artist to ever have won Grammy Awards in both Classical and Latin Jazz categories.[10]\n\nD'Rivera was a judge for the 5th and 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.[11]\n\n### Paquito D'Rivera Quintet\n\n[edit]The band backing D'Rivera consists of Peruvian bassist Oscar Stagnaro, Argentinean trumpeter Diego Urcola, American drummer Mark Walker, and pianist Alex Brown. As a whole they are named the \"Paquito D'Rivera Quintet\"[12] and under this name they were awarded the Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album for the album *Live at the Blue Note* in 2001.[13]\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]D'Rivera resides in North Bergen, New Jersey.[14] In 2001 D'Rivera purchased a $750,000 colonial-style home, which is located on Boulevard East, overlooking the Hudson River. In September 2023, he put the home up for sale for $1.75 million.[15]\n\n## Honors and awards\n\n[edit]- 2003 Doctorate Honoris Causa in Music, Berklee College of Music\n- 2004 Clarinet of the Year Award, Jazz Journalists Association\n- 2005 NEA Jazz Masters\n- 2005 National Medal of Arts\n- 2006 Clarinet of the Year, Jazz Journalists Association\n- 2007 Composer in Residence, Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts\n- 2007 Fellowship Award for Music Composition, Guggenheim Foundation\n- 2007 Living Jazz Legend Award, The Kennedy Center and The Catherine B.

To alleviate boredom and keep herself entertained, she began a daily vlog of her house sitting experience on her personal YouTube channel *GracieHInABox*.

The event primarily features prominent video stars from across the internet. It was founded by veteran YouTube creators John and Hank Green (Vlogbrothers), and was later acquired by Viacom (now Paramount Skydance) in 2018 and later acquired by Informa in 2024. Its offices remain in Missoula, Montana, sharing a building with Complexly. VidCon's international presence continues to expand with additional events planned in Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Mexico City, Australia, and S\u00e3o Paulo. In October 2020, VidCon Now relaunched as an ongoing, free digital offering.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The first VidCon was held on July 9\u201311, 2010, at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza hotel in Los Angeles and sold out in advance,[2] with over 1,400 people attending.[3]\n\nIn February 2018, Viacom (owner of the Viacom Media Networks and film studio Paramount Pictures) announced that they were acquiring VidCon, as part of its efforts to expand its live events business and expand from TV programming to next-generation entertainment platforms. Jim Louderback will remain the CEO of the convention, and co-founder Hank Green will continue to be involved and work closely with the team. Its offices will also exist in Missoula, Montana.[4][5] Internet reception to this acquisition was mixed, with some noting the irony of Viacom acquiring VidCon a decade after their lawsuit against Google and YouTube for copyright infringement. Hank Green reassured fans that Viacom's acquisition[6] would allow the convention to flourish.[7][8] Three conferences were cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a series of online programming, VidCon Now, became available for registration.[9]\n\nIn March 2021, VidCon announced that it would host its next U.S. conference at the Anaheim Convention Center from October 22\u201324, 2021, delayed from its usual summer scheduling in order to increase the chance that an in-person event could be held.[10] VidCon also announced that TikTok would be the top sponsor of the 2021 event, replacing YouTube who had been the main sponsor since 2013.[11] On August 20, however, VidCon announced the cancellation of its 2021 event \"due to the recent increases in COVID-19 cases [in California] and evolving health and safety mandates.\" The convention was rescheduled to June 22\u201325, 2022 in Anaheim.[12] The 2023 event was held between June 21\u201324 and was sponsored by YouTube for the first time since 2019. In September 2024, Viacom's successor Paramount Global sold VidCon to Informa.[13]\n\nIn 2020, all international VidCon events were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the flagship convention in Anaheim, California resumed in 2022, international editions such as VidCon London, VidCon Australia, and VidCon Asia have not returned. A limited expansion has continued in Mexico City, but no other international locations have been announced. In August 2024, Paramount Global sold VidCon to Informa, the UK-based company behind Fan Expo. Following the acquisition, Informa executives stated their ambition to eventually bring VidCon back to global markets, describing Anaheim as the \u201cSuper Bowl for creators\u201d and indicating that international expansion may be revisited in the future.\n\n## Events\n\n[edit]## International conventions\n\n[edit]| Convention | Country | Location(s) | Venue | Inaugural event | Most recent |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nVidCon London(Formerly VidCon Europe) |\nNetherlands (2017\u201318) United Kingdom (2019\u20132020) |\nAmsterdam (2017\u201318) London (2019\u20132020) |\nRAI Amsterdam Convention Centre (2017) M\u00f6venpick Hotel Amsterdam (2018) ExCeL London (2019\u20132020) |\nApril 8\u20139, 2017 | February 20\u201323, 2020 |\nVidCon Australia\n|\nAustralia | Melbourne | Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre | September 9\u201310, 2017 | September 19\u201322, 2019 |\nVidCon Asia\n|\nSingapore | Singapore | Raffles City Convention Centre | December 3\u20134, 2019 | November 25, 2021 |\nVidCon Abu Dhabi\n|\nUnited Arab Emirates | Abu Dhabi | Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre | December 3\u20136, 2021 | \u2014 |\nVidCon Mexico\n|\nMexico | Mexico City | Citibanamex Center | May 6\u20139, 2021 | August 9\u201311, 2024 |\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"VidCon 2019\".

The show consisted of 72 episodes, ranging from five to seven minutes in length. The series ended on August 23, 2014 and has accumulated over 3 million views on the Pemberley Digital YouTube channel.\n\n[2]On September 19, 2018, a video featuring Sotomura and Bailey as Emma and Alex announced that a continuation of the series would be starting in October 2018. Due to lack of funding raised from online sources \u2013 such as GoFundMe \u2013 the sequel series ended after just seventeen episodes, with the new story left incomplete.\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]The series focuses on the life of Emma Woodhouse and takes place at the offices of her eponymous lifestyle company, Emma Approved, an all-in-one lifestyle coaching, matchmaking, and event planning company. Emma decides to document her business successes (to the chagrin of her business partner Alex Knightley). Alex forces Emma to hire an assistant: Harriet Smith. When best friend Annie Taylor announces she wants to call off her wedding to Emma Approved client Ryan Weston, Harriet and Emma convince Ryan's step-brother Frank Churchill to send a wedding gift because he can\u2019t make it and the wedding is back on.\n\nHarriet has a crush on Emma Approved's IT guy Bobby Martin, but Emma doesn\u2019t approve the match and thinks Harriet can do better. Emma plans to set Harriet up with Emma Approved's newest client, Senator James Elton, but he likes Emma and thinks Harriet is below him. Elton leaves Emma Approved as a client when Emma rebuffs him. Emma takes a break from the company. When she returns, Izzy Knightley arrives, Emma's sister and Alex's sister-in-law. Turns out, Izzy isn\u2019t feeling heard by her husband John. Emma's meddling almost breaks the couple up, but eventually Izzy reveals what she really wants: to go back to school. Meanwhile, Harriet starts a music club (playing ukulele).\n\nAlex finds Emma's next client: Maddy Bates, whose accounting business is struggling. Emma decides to throw an elite fundraiser in order for Maddy gain more clients, and Frank Churchill arrives to help. Senator Elton returns to ask Emma Approved to plan his engagement party to Caroline Lee. Hating the experience with the Eltons, Emma decides to change the direction of the company and focus on high-profile charity causes. They hire Jane Fairfax to help, Maddy Bates\u2019 niece and Emma's self-identified rival. They put together a Bachelor\/Bachelorette Auction for human rights as their first cause.\n\nEmma decides to throw a baby shower for Annie at the same time that Emma Approved gets another benefit: the opening of Boxx, a celebrity-led restaurant. Emma gets too distracted by the Boxx Hill event and ends up missing most of Annie's baby shower. Though the event is a success, Emma's and Frank's behavior toward Maddy and her homemade preserves in front of the celebrity guests at the opening event disgusts Jane and Alex, who both leave the company.\n\nEmma apologizes to Maddy, and then to Annie, who reveals Frank and Jane were secretly together and that Frank sold his company. When Emma tells Harriet, Harriet tells Emma that she likes Alex. Emma realizes she has feelings for Alex, and apologizes once and for all to Bobby Martin for pushing him away from Harriet. Alex returns to Emma Approved and confesses to Emma that he is in love with her. They kiss. Emma approaches Harriet with the news that she and Alex are now together. Harriet reveals she still has feelings for Bobby Martin. She and Emma organize a surprise for him, and Harriet and Bobby kiss.\n\nThe second series opens five years later; Emma is slipping back to her less-confident self after the failed engagement of Anne Elliot and Mr. Wentworth. The company is overburdened with going public, and a full documentary crew is filming their progress. Alex approaches Emma with a new client for her to focus on: Ricky Collins.\n\n## Format\n\n[edit]The story is told in a vlog-style format from the point of view of the eponymous character, Emma Woodhouse. Each episode is between four and eight minutes. The show takes place entirely in the Emma Approved offices, where there are cameras set up in Emma's office and at Alex's, Harriet's and Jane's desks. Emma also speaks with clients and colleagues through video chat.\n\nA second channel under Emma's full name includes supplementary videos to the main story. These videos include Harriet's initial application video to become Emma's assistant, a series of six question and answer videos featuring various cast members, a video by Martin confessing to Harriet that he likes her, and Harriet's Music Club videos which she starts after episode 32, though her first \"song\" (for Senator James Elton) appears after episode 21.\n\nAfter episode 67, a short series following Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax's flirting in the office (comprising nine under-two-minute episodes) was released entitled \"Frank and Jane\" on the main channel.\n\n## Characters\n\n[edit]**Emma Woodhouse**(Joanna Sotomura) is an ambitious, confident lifestyle coach, event planner and match maker. She believes that she's going to be the next Oprah, and so begins documenting her \"greatness\" for when she becomes famous. She starts out the series self-centered and oblivious to her own extremely privileged perspective, but grows to see her own shortcomings. Though she is often misguided, she has a big heart and is always trying to do what's best for the people around her. She has several catchphrases, like calling things \"Emma approved\" and asserting she's going to \"make your life better.\"**Alex Knightley**(Brent Bailey;*George Knightley*in the novel) is Emma's business partner and head of finance for Emma Approved. He is the voice of reason in Emma's life and shows her extreme patience. Emma often teases him for his poor sense of style, but he's able to tease her right back with his characteristic snark. Alex spends much of the series struggling to hide his romantic feelings for Emma.**Harriet Smith**(Dayeanne Hutton) is Emma's new assistant. She has a degree in library science and hopes to be a lifestyle expert like Emma. Harriet is extremely good hearted, if a little ditzy. Emma spends a lot of the series trying to mold Harriet in her own image, only to find that Harriet is best when she's being herself.**Bobby Martin**(James Brent Isaacs;*Robert Martin*in the novel) is Emma Approved's sweet and bumbling IT guy. He has feelings for Harriet, but Emma disapproves of the match and convinces Harriet to reject his advances. He enjoys bird-watching and poker and goes by the nickname B-Mart.**Frank Churchill**(Stephen A. Chang) is a high-profile entrepreneur who is constantly jetsetting to other countries to do business. Emma often relies on his celebrity and money to pull her out of trouble. He is boyish and charming and seems to have natural chemistry with Emma.**Jane Fairfax**(Tyra Colar) is an old friend of Emma's family. Since she is so successful and close in age to Emma, Emma feels a natural rivalry with Jane. Later in the series, Jane joins Emma Approved to help organize charity-related events.**Annie Taylor**(Alexis Boozer;*Anne Taylor*in the novel) is Emma's best friend. Emma has helped orchestrate all the major events in Annie's life, from meeting her future husband to her wedding day to her baby shower.**James Elton**(Paul Stuart;*Philip Elton*in the novel) is a California senator who comes to Emma to find him a match.**Ryan Weston**(Gabriel Voss;*Mr. Weston*in the novel) is a cupcake mogul and one of Emma's matchmaking clients. Emma matches him with Annie Taylor. They are happily married and expecting a child.**Izzy Knightley**(Mapuana Makia;*Isabella Knightley*in the novel) is Emma's older sister who is married to Alex's brother. She is a housewife with two kids, but is unhappy and restless. Emma helps her realize that she wants to go back to school.**Maddy Bates**(Nikea Gamby-Turner;*Miss Bates*in the novel) is a close friend of Emma's family and Jane Fairfax's aunt. Emma helps her find clients for her financial consulting business. Maddy makes jams in her spare time and likes nothing better than talking about Jane.**Caroline Lee**(Jessica Andres) is crossover role from*The Lizzie Bennet Diaries*. She replaces Augusta Hawkins in the original novel. Caroline is James Elton's new fianc\u00e9. Emma helps the couple plan their engagement party.\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]Initial response to Pemberley's Emma character was mixed due to her tendency toward \"unlikable\"[3] self-confidence and large ego, though the first two episodes garnered over 120,000 views in the show's first week.[4] By early January (three months into the series), Emma had won over her audience with her caring for those around her.[5] Emma Approved's viewership was only about 80% that of Pemberley's predecessor series *The Lizzie Bennet Diaries,*[6] but unlike that series, all of Emma's transmedia storytelling was monetized using brand integration including companies such as Modcloth and Samsung.[6]\n\nThe romantic leads, Joanna Sotomura and Brent Bailey, gained some attention for becoming a real couple during the run of the show, leading to their own fan following and the portmanteau \"Brentanna.\"[7]\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\n[edit]| Year | Award | Category | Result | Nominee(s) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 2014 | ||||\nIAWTV Awards[8] |\nBest Comedy Series | Nominated | ||\n| Best Female Performance: Comedy | Nominated | Joanna Sotomura | ||\n| Best Ensemble Cast | Nominated | |||\nStreamy Awards[9] |\nAudience Choice | Finalist | ||\n| Best Actress in a Comedy | Nominated | Joanna Sotomura | ||\n| Best Actor in a Comedy | Nominated | Brent Bailey | ||\nCynopsis Digital Model D Awards[10] |\nWeb Series Comedy | Nominated | ||\n| 2015 | Creative Arts Emmy Award | Outstanding Original Interactive Program[11] |\nWon | Bernie Su, Tamara Krinsky, Alexandra Edwards, Tracy Bitterolf, Kate Rorick |\n\n## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a**\"Lizzie Bennet Diaries companion Emma Approved debuts today\".

Her works are implicit critiques of the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.[2][b] Her use of social commentary, realism, wit, and irony have earned her acclaim amongst critics and scholars.\n\nAusten wrote major novels before the age of 22, but she was not published until she was 35. The anonymously published *Sense and Sensibility* (1811), *Pride and Prejudice* (1813), *Mansfield Park* (1814), and *Emma* (1816) were moderate successes, but they did not bring her public fame in her lifetime. (She was privately known to be the author of these novels, including by notable people such as the Prince Regent.) She wrote two other novels\u2014*Northanger Abbey* and *Persuasion*, both published posthumously in 1817\u2014and began another, eventually titled *Sanditon*, but it was left unfinished on her death. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, the short epistolary novel *Lady Susan*, and the unfinished novel *The Watsons*.\n\nSince her death Austen's novels have rarely been out of print. A significant transition in her reputation occurred in 1833, when they were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series (illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering and sold as a set). They gradually gained wide acclaim and popular readership. In 1869 her nephew published *A Memoir of Jane Austen*. Her work has inspired a large number of critical essays and has been included in many literary anthologies. Her novels have been adapted in numerous films, including *Pride and Prejudice* (1940), *Sense and Sensibility* (1995), *Pride & Prejudice* (2005), *Emma* (2020), and an adaptation of *Lady Susan*, *Love & Friendship* (2016), as well as the film *Persuasion* and the miniseries *Pride and Prejudice*, both released in 1995 by the BBC.\n\n## Biographical sources\n\nThe scant biographical information about Austen comes from her surviving letters and a number of sketches her family members and contemporaries wrote about her.[4]\n\nOnly about 160 of the approximately 3,000 letters Austen would have written in the course of her lifetime have survived and been published. It is believed that Cassandra Austen destroyed the bulk of the letters she received from her sister, by burning or otherwise. One theory is that she wanted to ensure that the \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members.\"[5] In the interest of protecting reputations from Jane's penchant for honesty and forthrightness, Cassandra, it is surmised, may have omitted details of illnesses, unhappiness and anything she considered unsavoury.[6] It is certainly the case that important details about her life and the actions of the Austen family were deliberately omitted, such as any mention of Austen's brother George, whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to have him raised away from its home, as was common for the time, or of wealthy Aunt Jane Leigh-Perrot, who was arrested, tried, and acquitted on charges of grand larceny.[7]\n\nThe first Austen biography was her brother Henry Thomas Austen's 1818 \"Biographical Notice\". It appeared in a posthumous edition of *Northanger Abbey* and included extracts from two letters, apparently published against the judgement of other family members. Details of Austen's life continued to be omitted or embellished in her nephew's *A Memoir of Jane Austen*, published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography *Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters*, published in 1913, all of which included additional letters.[8]\n\nAusten's family and relatives built a legend of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying her as a woman in a happy domestic situation, whose family was the mainstay of her life. Critics have long taken issue with this depiction of a \"mild\" Austen.[9] Modern biographers include details excised from the letters and family biographies, but the biographer Jan Fergus writes that the challenge is to keep the view balanced, not to present her languishing in periods of deep unhappiness as \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family.\"[4]\n\n## Early years to age 20\n\n### Family\n\nJane Austen was born on 16 December 1775 in Steventon, Hampshire. Her father, George Austen (1731\u20131805), wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother, Cassandra, \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago.\" He added that the newborn infant was \"a present plaything for Cassy and a future companion.\"[10] The winter of 1775-1776 was particularly harsh, and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church and christened Jane.[10]\n\nGeorge served as the rector of the Anglican parishes of Steventon and Deane.[12][c] The Reverend Austen came from an old and wealthy family of wool merchants. As each generation of eldest sons received inheritances, George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. In 1745, at the age of fifteen, George's sister Philadelphia was apprenticed to a milliner in Covent Garden.[14] At the age of sixteen, George entered St John's College, Oxford,[15] where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739\u20131827).[16] She came from the prominent Leigh family. Her father was rector at All Souls College, Oxford, where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot.[17]\n\nGeorge Austen and Cassandra Leigh were engaged, probably around 1763, when they exchanged miniatures.[18] He received the living of the Steventon parish from Thomas Knight, the wealthy husband of his second cousin.[19] They married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithin's Church in Bath, by licence, in a simple ceremony, two months after Cassandra's father died.[20] Their income was modest, with George's small *per annum* living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death.[21]\n\nAfter the living at the nearby Deane rectory had been purchased for George by his wealthy uncle Francis Austen,[22] the Austens took up temporary residence there, until Steventon rectory, a 16th-century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767.[23] Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then place it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.[24]\n\n### Steventon\n\nIn 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771.[25] At about this time, Cassandra could no longer ignore the signs that little George was developmentally disabled. He had seizures and may have been deaf and mute. At this time she chose to send him to be fostered.[26] In 1773 Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.[27]\n\nAccording to the biographer Park Honan, the Austen home had an \"open, amused, easy intellectual atmosphere\", in which the ideas of those with whom members of the Austen family might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed.[28]\n\nThe family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members.[29] The elder Cassandra spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter, and her daughter Philly.[30][d] Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"[31]\n\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and 1780s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents upon her return, \"... and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\"[32] Le Faye writes that \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family, there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"[33]\n\nFrom 1773 until 1796 George supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.[34] He had an annual income of \u00a3200 (equivalent to \u00a332,000 in 2023) from his two livings.[35] This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about \u00a3100 annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between \u00a31,000 and \u00a35,000.[35] He also rented the 200-acre Cheesedown farm from his benefactor Thomas Knight, which could make a profit of \u00a3300 (equivalent to \u00a348,000 in 2023) a year.[36]\n\nDuring this period of her life, Jane attended church regularly, socialised with friends and neighbours,[e] and read novels\u2014often of her own composition\u2014aloud to her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the assembly rooms in the town hall.[37] Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".[38]\n\n### Education\n\nIn 1783 Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Ann Cawley, who took them to Southampton later that year. That autumn both girls were sent home after catching typhus, of which Jane nearly died.[39] She was from then home-educated, until she attended boarding school with her sister from early in 1785 at the Reading Abbey Girls' School, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle.[40] The curriculum probably included French, spelling, needlework, dancing, music and drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family.[41] After 1786 Austen \"never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment\".[42]\n\nHer education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry.[43] Irene Collins said that Austen \"used some of the same school books as the boys\".[44] Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father's library and that of a family friend, Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library. Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqu\u00e9 experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.[45]\n\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan's *The Rivals* (1775) and David Garrick's *Bon Ton*. Austen's eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant.[46] Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated.[47] At the age of 12 she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.[48]\n\n### Juvenilia (1787\u20131793)\n\nFrom at least the time she was aged eleven, Austen wrote poems and stories to amuse herself and her family.[49] She exaggerated mundane details of daily life and parodied common plot devices in \"stories [] full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits\", according to Janet Todd.[50] Austen compiled fair copies of twenty-nine early works from 1787 to 1793 into three bound notebooks with 90,000 words,[51] now known as the Juvenilia,[52] named \"Volume the First\", \"Volume the Second\" and \"Volume the Third\". The Juvenilia are often, according to the scholar Richard Jenkyns, \"boisterous\" and \"anarchic\"; he compares them to the work of the 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne.[53]\n\nAmong these works is a satirical novel in letters titled *Love and Freindship* [*sic*], written when aged fourteen in 1790,[54] in which she mocked popular novels of sensibility.[55] The next year, she wrote *The History of England*, a manuscript of thirty-four pages accompanied by thirteen watercolour miniatures by her sister, Cassandra. Austen's *History* parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith's *History of England* (1764).[56] Honan speculates that not long after writing *Love and Freindship* Austen decided to \"write for profit, to make stories her central effort\", that is, to become a professional writer. When she was around eighteen years old, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.[57]\n\nIn August 1792, aged seventeen, Austen started *Catharine or the Bower*, which presaged her mature work, especially *Northanger Abbey*, but was left unfinished until picked up in *Lady Susan*, which Todd describes as less prefiguring than *Catharine*.[58] A year later she began, but abandoned, a short play, later titled *Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts*, which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, *The History of Sir Charles Grandison* (1753) by Samuel Richardson.[59]\n\nWhen Austen became an aunt for the first time aged eighteen, she sent her newborn niece Fanny Catherine Austen Knight \"five short pieces of ... the Juvenilia now known collectively as 'Scraps' .., purporting to be her 'Opinions and Admonitions on the conduct of Young Women'\". For Jane-Anna-Elizabeth Austen (also born in 1793), her aunt wrote \"two more 'Miscellanious Morsels', dedicating them to [Anna] on 2 June 1793, 'convinced that if you seriously attend to them, You will derive from them very important Instructions, with regard to your Conduct in Life.'\"[60] There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as 1811 (when she was 36), and that her niece and nephew Anna and James Edward Austen made further additions as late as 1814.[61]\n\n| External videos | |\n|---|---|\nPresentation by Claire Tomalin on Jane Austen: A Life, 23 November 1997, C-SPAN |\n\nBetween 1793 and 1795 (aged eighteen to twenty), Austen wrote *Lady Susan*, a short epistolary novel, usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work.[62] It is unlike any of Austen's other works. Austen's biographer Claire Tomalin describes the novella's heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\n\nTold in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration ... It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.\n\n[63]\n\nAccording to Janet Todd, the model for the title character may have been Eliza de Feuillide, who inspired Austen with stories of her glamorous life and various adventures. Eliza's French husband was guillotined in 1794 during the Reign of Terror amidst the French Revolution; she married Jane's brother Henry Austen in 1797.[29]\n\n## Ages 20 to 34\n\n### Tom Lefroy\n\nWhen Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"[65]\n\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was a \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\".[66] Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote that she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others.[66] The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea\".[66]\n\nHalperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him.[66] The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane never saw him again.[67] In November 1798 Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.[68]\n\n### Early manuscripts (1796\u20131798)\n\nAfter finishing *Lady Susan*, Austen began her first full-length novel *Elinor and Marianne*. Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as *Sense and Sensibility*.[69]\n\nAusten began a second novel, *First Impressions* (later published as *Pride and Prejudice*), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an \"established favourite\".[70] At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels; in November 1797 he wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing *First Impressions*. Cadell returned George's letter, marking it \"Declined by Return of Post\". Jane may not have known of her father's efforts.[71] Following the completion of *First Impressions*, Austen ret\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sanditon\n*Sanditon*\n\n\n| Author | Jane Austen |\n|---|---|\n| Language | English |\n| Genre | Romantic novel |\nPublication date | 1925 |\n| Publication place | United Kingdom |\n| Media type | Print (hardback & paperback) |\n| Text | Sanditon at Wikisource |\n\n* Sanditon* is an 1817 unfinished novel by the English writer Jane Austen. In January 1817, Austen began work on a new novel she called\n\n*The Brothers*, later titled\n\n*Sanditon*, and completed twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably because of illness.\n\n[1]R.W. Chapman first published a transcription of the original manuscript in 1925 under the name\n\n*Fragment of a Novel Written by Jane Austen, January\u2013March 1817*.\n\n[2]\n\n## Synopsis\n\n[edit]The novel centres on Charlotte Heywood, the eldest of the daughters still at home in the large family of a country gentleman from Willingden, Sussex. The narrative opens when the carriage of Mr and Mrs Parker of Sanditon topples over on a hill near the Heywood home. Because Mr Parker is injured in the crash, and the carriage needs repairs, the Parkers stay with the Heywood family for a fortnight. During this time, Mr Parker talks fondly of Sanditon, a town which until a few years before had been a small, unpretentious fishing village. With his business partner, Lady Denham, Mr Parker hopes to make Sanditon into a fashionable seaside resort. Mr Parker's enormous enthusiasm for his plans to improve and modernise Sanditon has resulted in the installation of bathing machines and the construction of a new home for himself and his family near the seashore. Upon repair of the carriage and improvement to Mr Parker's foot, the Parkers return to Sanditon, bringing Charlotte with them as their summer guest.\n\nUpon arrival in Sanditon, Charlotte meets the inhabitants of the town. Prominent among them is Lady Denham, a twice-widowed woman who received a fortune from her first husband and a title from her second. Living with Lady Denham is her niece Clara Brereton, a sweet and beautiful yet impoverished young lady. Also living in Sanditon are Sir Edward Denham and his sister Esther, nephew and niece to Lady Denham by her second husband. The siblings are poor and are thought to be seeking Lady Denham's fortune; Sir Edward is described as a silly and very florid man, though handsome.\n\nAfter settling in with the Parkers and encountering various neighbours, Charlotte and Mr and Mrs Parker are surprised by a visit from his two sisters and younger brother, all of whom are self-declared invalids. However, given their level of activity and seeming strength, Charlotte quickly surmises that their complaints are invented. Diana Parker has come on a mission to secure a house for a wealthy family from the West Indies, although she has not specifically been asked to help. She also brings word of a second large party, a girls' school, which is intending to summer at Sanditon. This news causes a stir in the small town, especially for Mr Parker, whose fondest wish is the promotion of tourism there.\n\nWith the arrival of Mrs Griffiths at Sanditon, it soon becomes apparent that the family from the West Indies and the girls' school group are one and the same. The visitors consist of Miss Lambe, a teenaged Antiguan-English heiress, and the two Miss Beauforts, English girls just arrived from the West Indies.[3] In short order, Lady Denham calls on Mrs. Griffiths to be introduced to Miss Lambe, the sickly and very rich young woman that she intends her nephew, Sir Edward, to marry.\n\nA carriage unexpectedly arrives bearing Sidney Parker, the middle Parker brother. He will be staying in town for a few days with two friends who will join him shortly. Sidney Parker is about 27 or 28 years old, and Charlotte finds him very good-looking, with a decided air of fashion.\n\nThe book fragment ends when Mrs Parker and Charlotte visit Sanditon House, Lady Denham's residence. There Charlotte spots Clara Brereton seated with Sir Edward Denham at her side having an intimate conversation in the garden and surmises that they must have a secret understanding. When they arrive inside, Charlotte observes that a large portrait of Sir Henry Denham hangs over the fireplace, whereas Lady Denham's first husband, who owned Sanditon House, only gets a miniature in the corner \u2013 obliged, as it were, to sit back in his own house and see the best place by the fire constantly occupied by Sir Henry Denham.\n\n## Characters\n\n[edit]**Mr. and Mrs. Heywood**\u2013 A prosperous gentleman farmer and his wife who open their home to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Parker, whose carriage overturns nearby. It was written that the Heywoods would have been even more prosperous if they had not had 14 children. They do not care to travel, but have no objection to their children doing so if they have the opportunity.**Charlotte Heywood**\u2013 The eldest of the Heywood daughters still at home. A nice, pretty girl who appears to be the heroine of the novel. Much of the story is told from her perspective. She is invited to experience the seaside at Sanditon with Mr. and Mrs. Parker.**Mr. Thomas Parker**\u2013 The eldest of the three Parker brothers. Middle-aged; fanatical over the health benefits of sea air and water. He and Lady Denham are invested in promoting Sanditon as a smaller Brighton.**Mrs. Thomas Parker****(Mary)**\u2013 Thomas' wife and mother of their four children,**Little Mary**and three boys.**Sidney Parker**\u2013 The second Parker brother, who is 27\u201328 years old. Good-looking, well bred, \"air of ease and fashion and a lively countenance\". Most sources contend he was to be the hero and marry Charlotte; however, he is barely mentioned before Austen stopped writing and it is not known what other characters she might have had in mind. He and his three other siblings, Arthur, Susan, and Diana come to Sanditon for a visit.**Miss Susan Parker**\u2013 The older of the two spinster Parker sisters. A hypochondriac.**Miss Diana Parker**\u2013 34 years old. A hypochondriac when not busy being a nosy, self-satisfied, officious pest.**Arthur Parker**\u2013 The youngest Parker brother. 21 years old. An overweight hypochondriac. \"Poor health\" is his excuse to eat what he wants and sit lazily by the fire. Lives with his spinster sisters.**Lady Denham, n\u00e9e Brereton**\u2013 70 years old; twice widowed. She lives in Sanditon Hall, the largest house in the area and home of her first husband. She was born wealthy but was not well educated. She inherited more money from her first husband,**Mr. Hollis**. Her title came from her poor, second husband**Sir Harry Denham**. Many family members, her own and her late husbands', wish to inherit from her.**Sir Edward Denham**\u2013 He inherits Sir Harry's title but not the money. He is insincere, with loose morals. He would like to seduce Clara Brereton because she is \"young, lovely, and dependent\" and a rival for Lady Denham's fortune.**Miss Esther Denham**\u2013 The sister of Sir Edward.**Miss Clara Brereton**\u2013 The poor distant cousin of Lady Denham who has been living with her for about a year. She is a \"lovely and interesting young woman... Elegantly tall, regularly handsome, with great delicacy of complexion and soft blue eyes, (with) a sweetly modest and yet naturally graceful address.\"**Mrs. Whitby**\u2013 She runs the library\/general store in Sanditon.**Miss Whitby**\u2013 Helps with her mother's business.**Young Whitby**\u2013 Helps with his mother's business.**Mr. and Mrs. Hillier**\u2013 Mentioned as people now living in the Parker's previous family home since Mr. Thomas Parker built a modern new home named \"Trafalgar\".**Mrs. Griffiths**\u2013 Seems to be a professional chaperone who is paid to look after girls and introduce them around.**Miss Beaufort**\u2013 One of Mrs. Griffiths' charges, who plays the harp. Interested in fashion, and looking for a rich husband.**Miss Letitia Beaufort**\u2013 Younger sister to Miss Beaufort. She sketches. Also interested in fashion and looking for a rich husband.**Miss Lambe**\u2013 One of Mrs. Griffiths' charges. A 17-year-old \"half-mulatto\" heiress from the West Indies in poor health. Lady Denham is interested in her as a potential bride for her impecunious nephew Sir Edward.\n\n## Analysis and background\n\n[edit]The people of \"modern Sanditon\", as Austen calls it, have moved out of the \"old house \u2013 the house of [their] forefathers\" and are busily constructing a new world in the form of a modern seaside commercial town. The town of Sanditon is almost certainly based on Worthing, where Jane Austen stayed in late 1805 when the resort was first being developed. There is persuasive evidence that the character of Mr. Thomas Parker was inspired by Edward Ogle, Worthing's early entrepreneur, whom Jane Austen and her sister Cassandra knew.[4][5][6][7] Sanditon is, however, less of an actual reality than an ideal of the inhabitants \u2013 one that they express in their descriptions of it. These inhabitants have a conception of the town's identity and of the way in which this identity should be spread to, and appreciated by, the world:\n\nMy name perhaps... may be unknown at this distance from the coast \u2013 but Sanditon itself \u2013 everybody has heard of Sanditon, \u2013 the favourite \u2013 for a young and rising bathing-place, certainly the favourite spot of all that are to be found along the coast of Sussex; \u2013 the most favoured by nature, and promising to be the most chosen by man.\n\n\n\u2014 *Sanditon*\n\n## Continuations and adaptations\n\n[edit]Because Austen completed setting the scene for Sanditon, it has been a favourite of \"continuators\" \u2013 later writers who try to complete the novel within Austen's vision while emulating her style.

It is known as an important centre for Contemporary Indigenous Australian art, in particular the style created by the Papunya Tula artists in the 1970s, referred to colloquially as dot painting. Its population in 2016 was 404.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]Pintupi and Luritja people were forced off their traditional country in the 1930s and moved into Hermannsburg (Ntaria) and Haasts Bluff, where there were government ration depots. There were often tragic confrontations between these people, with their nomadic hunter-gathering lifestyle, and the cattlemen who were moving into the country and over-using the limited water supplies of the region for their cattle.[ citation needed]\n\nThe Australian Government built a water bore and some basic housing at Papunya in the 1950s to provide room for the increasing populations of people in the already-established Aboriginal communities and reserves. The community grew to over a thousand people in the early 1970s and was plagued by poor living conditions, health problems, and tensions between various tribal and linguistic groups. These festering problems led many people, especially the Pintupi, to move further west closer to their traditional country. After settling in a series of outstations, with little or no support from the government, the new community of Kintore was established about 250 kilometres (160 mi)west of Papunya in the early 1980s.[ citation needed]\n\nThe term \"Finke River Mission\" was initially an alternative name for the mission at Hermannsburg, but this name was later often used to include the settlements at Haasts Bluff, Areyonga and, later, Papunya. It now refers to all Lutheran missionary activity in Central Australia since the first mission was established at Hermannsburg in 1877.[5][6][7]\n\n## Description and demographics\n\n[edit]It is now home to a number of displaced Aboriginal people, mainly from the Pintupi and Luritja groups. At the 2016 Australian census, Papunya had a population of 404.[3]\n\nThe predominant religion at Papunya is Lutheranism, with 310 members, or 78.7% of the population, based on the 2016 census.[3]\n\nIt is the closest town to the Australian continental pole of inaccessibility. Papunya is on restricted Aboriginal land and requires a permit to enter or travel through.[ citation needed]\n\nWarumpi Band were an Australian country and Aboriginal rock group which formed in Papunya.[ citation needed]\n\n## Art\n\n[edit]### Papunya Tula\n\n[edit]During the 1970s a striking new art style emerged in Papunya, which by the 1980s began to attract national and then international attention as a significant Indigenous art movement, colloquially known as dot painting. Leading exponents of the style, who belonged to the Papunya Tula art cooperative founded in Papunya in 1972, included Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri, Kaapa Tjampitjinpa, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, and Pansy Napangardi.[8] The company now operates out of Alice Springs,[9] and covers an enormous area, extending into Western Australia, 700 kilometres (430 mi) west of Alice Springs.[10]\n\n### Papunya Tjupi Arts\n\n[edit]Papunya Tjupi Arts, a community-based, 100% Aboriginal-owned arts organisation, commenced in 2007,[11] and as of March 2021[update] hosts around 150 artists, many of whose works are featured in exhibitions and galleries around the world.[12] In 2009, Michael Nelson Tjakamarra (Kumantje Jagamara) became the artist leader at the arts centre.[13]\n\nArtists include Doris Bush Nungarrayi, Maureen Poulson, Charlotte Phillipus Napurrula, Tilau Nangala, Mona Nangala, Nellie Nangala, Carbiene McDonald Tjangala, Martha McDonald Napaltjarri, Candy Nelson Nakamarra, Dennis Nelson Tjakamarra, Narlie Nelson Nakamarra, Isobel Major Nampatjimpa, Isobel Gorey, Mary Roberts, Beyula Putungka Napanangka, Watson Corby among others.[14]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## Notes\n\n[edit]**^**Australian Bureau of Statistics (28 June 2022). \"Papunya (suburb and locality)\".*Australian Census 2021 QuickStats*.

The artwork was a reflection of Aboriginal understandings of their world but this system of beliefs was challenged by the arrival of white settlers in 1788.\n\nBy the mid-1800s, through violence, disease and dispossession, the Indigenous population had dramatically decreased. From the early 1900s the federal government introduced a policy of assimilation intended to ensure Australia had a uniform white-dominated culture.\n\nOne aspect of this assimilationist policy was the start, in the 1930s, of the Hermannsburg School art movement at Hermannsburg Mission in the Northern Territory. The Western Arrente artists\u2019 work was some of the first by Aboriginal people to interpret their country through western-style art \u2013 typically landscape watercolour painting.\n\n### Papunya\n\nIn Central Australia the federal government built assimilationist settlements where Aboriginal people, having been forcibly removed from their homelands, especially those from remote areas, could be gathered and provided services that would promote their integration into white society.\n\nPapunya, 240 kilometres west of Alice Springs, was one such community, founded in 1959. By 1970 there were 1400 mainly Pintupi and Luritja people, but also Warlpiri, Kakatja and Anmatyerr groups, living at Papunya. This was twice the population the settlement had been designed to accommodate.\n\nThe early years of Papunya were extremely difficult as families that had been relocated from their traditional lands were ravaged by disease. During 1963 and 1964 close to half the people in the settlement died.\n\n### Desert art movement\n\nThe men involved in the mural painting were inspired by what they had done and began gathering in small groups away from the women and children to paint their stories.\n\nInitially there was no thought that this was a commercial undertaking but in August 1971, Kaapa Tjampitjinpa\u2019s painting, *Men\u2019s Ceremony for the Kangaroo, Gulgardi* jointly won the Caltex Golden Jubilee Art Award alongside a European-style painting.\n\nFor the first time, Aboriginal art was viewed in the same context as white art and was judged to be of comparable quality. It made Kaapa the first Aboriginal Australian to win a contemporary art award.\n\nSoon after, a young school teacher Geoffrey Bardon took a selection of paintings to Alice Springs and raised $1300 for the artists. It was a sensation throughout the community; the artists were making money painting from their own designs, not western interpretations. Over the next six months, more than 600 paintings were sold.\n\nNot everyone in the community was pleased with the exposure of intimate Aboriginal knowledge to the outside world and there was opposition to aspects of the early paintings. Over time, the artists changed their styles to hide any secret or sacred knowledge incorporated into the designs.\n\n### Art in Papunya\n\nIn the late 1960s some men in Papunya began creating artwork in the Hermannsburg style. In 1971 Bardon arrived in the town.\n\nHe became interested in the sinuous patterns his students would draw in the playground sand and realised they had deep societal meaning. He proposed creating a public mural for the local school using these images.\n\nThe children were reluctant to participate, but eventually a group of elders met Bardon and presented him with a design, based on the honey ant dreaming, that they approved for the project.\n\nOver a period of weeks in September a rotating group of Aboriginal men including Old Bert Tjakamarra, Bill Stockman Tjalpatjarri, Long Jack Phillipus Tjakamarra, Old Mick Tjakamarra and Kaapa Tjampitjinpa painted the mural.\n\n### Papunya Tula Artists cooperative\n\nThe movement grew as more men became interested in painting and in October 1971 they formed the Papunya Artists cooperative within the Papunya School. The white administration of the community was opposed to the cooperative because it was an entirely Aboriginal-run organisation and therefore existed in opposition to the assimilationist policy.\n\nThe name Papunya Tula was born at a gathering of painters at Charley Creek near Alice Springs in June 1972. Bardon asked the men \u2018What do you want to call the company?\u2019. The Pintupi man Charlie Tarawa (Tjaruru) immediately said, \u2018Papunya Tula\u2019, which is the name of a hill outside the town that means \u2018a meeting place for all brothers and cousins\u2019.\n\n**As Bardon said:**\n\n\u2026 that morning Papunya Tula became a living idea, and everyone was happy.\n\n\nThe Papunya Tula Artists cooperative was Australia\u2019s first Aboriginal arts company and foreshadowed the federal government shifting its Indigenous policies from assimilation to self-determination.\n\n### Papunya goes international\n\nThere were trying times in the first years of the Papunya Tula company. Bardon was forced to leave due to sickness he believed was brought about by stress arising from his dealings with Papunya\u2019s white administrators.\n\nFor a while, the painters had difficulty accessing materials and markets, but a series of motivated arts administrators assisted the group throughout the 1970s while the artists created newer and more individual styles.\n\nBy the 1980s the group had secured national exposure through state gallery exhibitions and then, in the latter part of the decade, international recognition with exhibitions in New York, London, Auckland, Paris and Venice.\n\nPapunya Tula became a bridge between Aboriginal and white culture and in the process evolved as one of Australia\u2019s most recognisable art forms.\n\nIn our collection\n\nExplore Defining Moments\n\n### References\n\nGeoffrey Bardon, *Papunya Tula: Art of the Western Desert*, McPhee Gribble, Ringwood, Victoria, 1991.\n\nGeoffrey Bardon and James Bardon, *Papunya: A Place Made After the Story*, The Miegunyah Press, Carlton, Vic. 2004.\n\nHetti Perkins and Hannah Fink, *Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius*, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, 2002.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestMessengerEmail","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_fv8TLrZZ4NW5vivMfhucCmq7\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"author identifies as Pintupi winner Victorian Premier's Prize for Indigenous Writing 'Pintupi' 'Victorian Premier's Prize' 'winner' 'author identifies'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: News 2024 Victorian Premier's Literary Award winners announced\nURL: https:\/\/creative.vic.gov.au\/news\/2025\/2024-victorian-premiers-literary-award-winners-announced\nJournalist, radio broadcaster and writer Daniel Browning was awarded the Prize for Indigenous Writing for Close to the Subject: Selected Works.\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Victorian Premier's Literary Award for Indigenous Writing - Wikipedia\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Victorian_Premier%27s_Literary_Award_for_Indigenous_Writing\nWinners and shortlists ; John Morrissey, Firelight, Finalist ; Ellen van Neerven, Personal Score: Sport, culture, identity, Finalist.\n\n---\n\nResult 2: UQP authors win at the 2025 Victorian Premier's Literary Awards\nURL: https:\/\/www.uqp.com.au\/blog\/uqp-authors-win-at-the-2025-victorian-premiers-literary-awards\nWe are delighted to congratulate Wanda Gibson, Amy McQuire and Jeanine Leane on winning at the 2025 Victoria Premier's Literary Awards in their respective ...\n\n---\n\nResult 3: Victorian Premier's Literary Awards 2025 winners announced\nURL: https:\/\/www.booksandpublishing.com.au\/articles\/2025\/03\/19\/268390\/victorian-premiers-literary-awards-2025-winners-announced-embargoed\/\nGibson was among several First Nations authors recognised in the 2025 awards: Jeanine Leane took out the Victorian Premier's Prize for ...\n\n---\n\nResult 4: Victorian Premier's Literary Awards \u2013 Winners Announced\nURL: https:\/\/www.premier.vic.gov.au\/victorian-premiers-literary-awards-winners-announced-0\nLegendary Gunditjmara and Bundjalung musician Archie Roach won the Prize for Indigenous Writing for his memoir Tell Me Why: The Story of My Life ...\n\n---\n\nResult 5: Winner of Victorian Premier's Literary Award for Indigenous Writing ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.artshub.com.au\/news\/news\/winner-of-victorian-premier-s-literary-award-for-indigenous-writing-announced-245676-2338050\/\nOn Wednesday, Melissa Lucashenko won the Victorian Premier's Literary Award for Indigenous Writing for her fifth novel, Mullumbimby.

It is one of the Wati languages of the large Pama\u2013Nyungan family. It is one of the varieties of the Western Desert Language (WDL).\n\nPintupi is traditionally located in the Northern Territory of Australia. However, Pintupi people have married into or migrated into the Goldfields WA region and the language can be found amongst the Goldfields population.\n\nPintupi is the name commonly used to refer to a variety of the Western Desert Language spoken by indigenous people whose traditional lands are in the area between Lake Macdonald and Lake Mackay, stretching from Mount Liebig in the Northern Territory to Jupiter Well (west of Pollock Hills) in Western Australia. These people moved (or were forced to move) into the indigenous communities of Papunya and Haasts Bluff in the west of the Northern Territory in the 1940s\u20131980s. The last Pintupi people to leave their traditional lifestyle in the desert came into Kiwirrkura in 1984.[5] Over recent decades they have moved back into their traditional country, setting up the communities of Kintore (in Pintupi known as Walungurru) in the Northern Territory, Kiwirrkura and Jupiter Well (in Pintupi Puntutjarrpa) in Western Australia. (Wikipedia)\n\nChildren who were born in Papunya and Haasts Bluff grew up speaking a new variety of Pintupi, now known as **Pintupi-Luritja**, due to their close contact with speakers of Arrernte, Warlpiri and other varieties of the WDL. This has continued through the moves west so that most Pintupi people today speak Pintupi-Luritja, although there remains a clear distinction between the more western and eastern varieties.\n\nPintupi is one of the healthier Aboriginal languages and is taught to local children in schools.\n\n**Pintupi Resources**\n\n*Pintupi Alphabet Chart*\n\nGALCAC stocks a colourful, rip-proof wall chart of the Pintupi alphabet.

Australia has more than 250 indigenous languages including 800 dialects. But today I am going to focus on one: Pintupi.\n\nPintupi belongs to the Wati branch of the Pama-Nyungan language family. The traditional land of the Pintupi people stretches from Lake Macdonald to Lake Mackay and from Mount Liebig to Jupiter Wells in the Western Region of Australia. However, in the 1940s until the 1980s the Pintupi people were forced to move out of their native lands into the lands of the Papunya and the Haasts Bluff in the Northern Territory. In recent years, there has been an initiative for the Pintupi to move back to their original homeland.\n\nAs of 2016, there were about 150 speakers of the original Pintupi language. This may not seem like a lot of speakers, however, that can be attributed to the emerging dialect in the younger generations. A new variety or dialect of Pintupi called Pintupi-Luritja is being spoken by the children growing up in the displaced areas where other indigenous languages, such as Arrernte and Warlpiri, are spoken. Including this new dialect, there were 900 Pintupi speakers in 2016. These numbers have the potential to rise as not only are children learning the language through their parents, but it is also being taught in schools.\n\nThe Pintupi language itself has 17 consonant phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes, three of which are long and three are short. All are monophthongal at the phonemic level. The \u201cr\u201d letter has a single contact trill (also known as a flap) but can increase to a true trill in slow, emphatic, or angry speech. In general, Pintupi is an easier language to read out loud because of its straightforward phonological structure with consonants and vowels. There are two syllable types: consonant followed by a vowel and consonant-vowel-consonant. The first syllable is always the stressed syllable. Secondary stress can appear on any following syllables in a word, and the language is consistent in following its own rules. However, not much is available online in terms of learning grammar such as sentence structure, conjugation, or vocabulary.\n\nThis alphabet chart is from the Wangka Language School in Australia\n\nPintupi-Luritja became the first Indigenous Australian language to receive a full official translation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It was translated by the elders and linguists at the Australian National University in 2015.

It's part of the evolution of the community; there are more people with a good education.\n\n\"Aboriginal people have always been storytellers, so it's a natural thing to do,\" he says of the decision to separate Indigenous writing from the Multicultural NSW Award, which went to *Good Muslim Boy* by Osamah Sami.\n\nIn their praise of his book, the judges said: \"*Dark Emu* reveals enormous Aboriginal achievement in governance and agriculture, and restores these to their rightful place at the epicentre of Australian history ... a voice at once catalysing and unifying, Bruce Pascoe is without peer in his field.\"\n\nPascoe, whose great-grandmother was Aboriginal, found references in diaries by Sir Thomas Mitchell and other explorers around the continent to vast cultivated fields of yams and grain fields, which were soon destroyed by settlers' sheep and cattle.\n\n\"They were so focused on creating a little England that anything Aboriginal was anathema,\" he says. \"But the yam is 10 times as nutritious as the potato.\"\n\nA former teacher who works to preserve Indigenous languages and stories, Pascoe grows grain and makes bread from indigenous grasses at his home near Mallacoota in remote north-east Victoria. He believes they can become commercially viable.\n\nEvidence from one grinding dish shows, \"Aboriginal people were producing bread 34,000 years ago \u2013 that's 15,000 years before anyone else\", he says.\n\nHis next books are a young-adult story about a horse, *Mrs Whitlam*, and a novel that suggests land war may not be natural to humans, based on Aboriginal culture.\n\nPascoe and his wife also run a B&B, and he says, \"I make more money from cleaning toilets and vacuuming floors than writing\".\n\nAmong other awards, the Christina Stead Prize for Fiction went to Filipino-Australian novelist Merlinda Bobis for *Locust Girl*, a post-apocalyptic allegory about two girls living in a world without water \u2013 one of three shortlisted works on climate change.\n\n**Meet the winners at Sydney Writers' Festival, Thursday May 19 at 1.30pm, Sydney Dance 2, Walsh Bay.**\n\n** FESTIVAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**Kate Tempest, opening address, Tuesday, 6.30pm, Roslyn Packer Theatre**-\n**Insiders Live, George Megalogenis, Niki Savva, Annabel Crabb et al, Wednesday, 3pm, Pier 2\/3, Walsh Bay**\n\n2016 NSW PREMIER'S LITERARY AWARD WINNERS\n\nBook of the Year ($10,000)\n\n*Dark Emu* Bruce Pascoe (Magabala Books)\n\nChristina Stead Prize for Fiction ($40,000)\n\n*Locust Girl: A Lovesong* Merlinda Bobis (Spinifex Press)\n\nUTS Glenda Adams Award for New Writing ($5,000 \u2013 sponsored by UTS)\n\n*An Astronaut's Life* Sonja Dechian (Text Publishing)\n\nDouglas Stewart Prize for Non-fiction ($40,000)\n\n*Reckoning: A Memoir* Magda Szubanski (Text Publishing)\n\nKenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry ($30,000)\n\n*brush* Joanne Burns (Giramondo)\n\nPatricia Wrightson Prize for Children's Literature ($30,000)\n\n*Teacup* Rebecca Young & Matt Ottley (Scholastic Australia)\n\nEthel Turner Prize for Young People's Literature ($30,000)\n\n*Laurinda* Alice Pung (Black Inc.)\n\nNick Enright Prize for Playwriting ($30,000)\n\n*The Bleeding Tree* Angus Cerini (Griffin Theatre Sydney)\n\nBetty Roland Prize for Scriptwriting ($30,000)\n\n*Deadline Gallipoli, Episode 4: \"The Letter\"* Cate Shortland (Matchbox Pictures)\n\nMulticultural NSW Award ($20,000)\n\n*Good Muslim Boy* Osamah Sami (Hardie Grant Books)\n\nIndigenous Writers Prize ($30,000)\n\nJOINT WINNERS:\n\n*Dark Emu* Bruce Pascoe (Magabala Books)\n\n*Heat and Light* Ellen van Neerven (University of Queensland Press)\n\nSpecial Award\n\nDr Rosie Scott AM, for her contribution to literature and social causes as a writer, mentor and activist.\n\nPeople's Choice Award\n\n*The Life of Houses* Lisa Gorton (Giramondo)","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_VdWBaIU9dDWcmHB5Tx6afsQi\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Bruce Pascoe identifies with which people 'identifies' 'Bruce Pascoe' 'ancestral' 'people' 'Bunurong' 'Tasmanian'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: The Deep Fake Project - Exposing Academics & Public Figures Who ...\nURL: https:\/\/www.dark-emu-exposed.org\/home\/deep-fakes-academics-appropriate-aborigines-again-x2c94\nGenealogical records that we have inspected appear to indicate that there is no Aboriginal ancestry in Pascoe's alleged family tree.

(?\u20131982) Lyn Harwood (1982\u2013 ) |\n| Children | 2 |\n\nBruce Pascoe (born in 1947) is an Australian writer. He writes many kinds of books, including stories, non-fiction (true stories), poems, and books for children. Sometimes he uses other names, called **pen names**, like **Murray Gray** and **Leopold Glass**. Bruce Pascoe identifies as an Aboriginal person. Since August 2020, he has been a special professor at the University of Melbourne. He teaches about Indigenous (Aboriginal) farming methods.\n\nPascoe is most famous for his book *Dark Emu: Black Seeds: Agriculture or Accident?* (published in 2014). In this book, he suggests that traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were not just hunter-gatherers. He argues they also practiced farming, engineering, and built permanent homes. He believes their old ways could help Australia with sustainable development in the future.\n\n## Contents\n\n## Bruce Pascoe's Early Life and School\n\nBruce Pascoe was born in Richmond, Victoria in 1947. He grew up in a family that didn't have a lot of money. His dad, Alf, was a carpenter. His mom, Gloria Pascoe, later won a gold medal in lawn bowls at the 1980 Arnhem Paralympics.\n\nBruce spent his first few years on King Island. His dad worked at a mine there. When Bruce was 10, his family moved to Mornington, Victoria. Two years later, they moved to Fawkner, a suburb of Melbourne.\n\nHe went to a local public school. Then he finished high school at University High School. His sister had won a scholarship to go there. Bruce then went to the University of Melbourne. He first studied business but then changed to teaching. After getting his teaching degree, he taught in a small town near Shepparton. He also taught in Bairnsdale for nine years.\n\n## Bruce Pascoe's Career as a Writer\n\nWhile taking a break from teaching, Bruce Pascoe bought a 300-hectare (740-acre) farm. He also sometimes worked as an abalone fisherman. In his free time, he started writing short stories, poems, and articles for newspapers.\n\nIn 1982, he moved back to Melbourne. He wanted to publish a magazine of short stories. When he couldn't find a publisher, he decided to start his own company. He raised money with his friend Lorraine Phelan. He ran Pascoe Publishing and Seaglass Books with his wife, Lyn Harwood.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1998, Pascoe edited and published a magazine called *Australian Short Stories*. This magazine came out every three months. It featured all kinds of short stories by both new and famous writers. The first issue almost sold all 20,000 copies.\n\nHis 1988 novel *Fox* is about a person looking for their Aboriginal identity and home. The book talks about important issues like land rights for Aboriginal people. It also shows how Aboriginal traditions can mix with modern life.\n\n*Convincing Ground: Learning to Fall in Love with Your Country* (2007) is another of his books. Its title comes from the Convincing Ground massacre. The book looks at old documents and stories about events in Australian history. It connects them to ongoing discussions about identity and memory. The publisher describes it as a book for all Australians. It helps people understand Australia's Indigenous past in a respectful way.\n\nPascoe was also in a TV show called *First Australians* in 2008. He has worked a lot on saving the Wathaurong language. He even created a dictionary for the language.\n\nHis book for young adults, *Fog a Dox*, won the Prime Minister's Literary Awards in 2013. It was also nominated for other awards. The judges for the Prime Minister's Award said that the story included Indigenous cultural knowledge.\n\n*Dark Emu* (2014)\n\n*Dark Emu: Black Seeds: Agriculture or Accident?* was first published in 2014. This book challenges the idea that Aboriginal peoples in Australia before European settlement were only hunter-gatherers. Pascoe says that he found evidence in old settler accounts and other sources. This evidence suggests that traditional Aboriginal societies had farming, aquaculture (water farming), engineering, and villages with permanent houses.\n\nThe book won Book of the Year at the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards. Many people praised it for making past research on Aboriginal economies popular. The book also caused some discussion. A positive review in an online magazine led to a debate about how Pascoe used his historical sources.\n\nA second edition, called *Dark Emu: Aboriginal Australia and the Birth of Agriculture*, came out in 2018. A version for younger readers, *Young Dark Emu: A Truer History*, was published in 2019. The 2019 version was nominated for an award in children's literature in 2020.\n\nThe success of *Dark Emu* led to another book called *Farmers or Hunter-Gatherers?*. This book, by Peter Sutton and Keryn Walshe, argues that Pascoe chose certain sources and misunderstood some evidence. They believe his conclusions give a misleading view of Aboriginal societies.\n\nIn October 2019, it was announced that a documentary film of *Dark Emu* would be made for television. Bruce Pascoe helped write the film.\n\n### Later Work and Other Roles\n\nIn September 2015, Bruce Pascoe was part of a special event in New York. He was one of six members of the First Nations Australia Writers Network who read their work.\n\nIn September 2020, Pascoe became a special professor at the University of Melbourne. His role is to help people learn about Indigenous agriculture. He also helps with research in this area.\n\nPascoe is a volunteer with the Country Fire Authority. He helped fight the bushfires in 2019\u20132020 near Mallacoota. In January 2020, he went to New South Wales to help there. He then returned to Mallacoota. He cancelled some events to stay in East Gippsland. He wanted to check the damage to his property and help his community recover from the fires.\n\n## Bruce Pascoe's Aboriginal Identity\n\nBruce Pascoe says that in his early thirties, he found Aboriginal ancestors on both sides of his family. These ancestors included people from Tasmania (Palawa), the Bunurong people of Victoria, and the Yuin people of southern New South Wales. By the age of 40, he identified himself as Koori.\n\nHe knows he also has Cornish and European ancestors. But he says he feels Aboriginal. He wrote, \"It doesn\u2019t matter about the colour of your skin, it's about how deeply embedded you are in the culture. It's the pulse of my life.\" He said his family denied their Aboriginal background for a long time. He only learned about it when he looked into the \"missing parts\" of his family's story. This led him to Aboriginal society and culture.\n\nIn his book *Convincing Ground* (2007), Pascoe wrote about people like him who find out about their distant Aboriginal heritage. He said that those who grew up without knowing their Aboriginality cannot have experienced racism or other difficulties. He believes they cannot \"fully understand what it is to be Aboriginal.\" He also mentioned that some family records have often been \"pruned of a few branches.\" In this book and in interviews, Pascoe admits his Aboriginal ancestry is distant. He has said he is \"more Cornish than Koori.\"\n\nIn January 2020, Pascoe said that claims he is not Aboriginal are meant to discredit his book *Dark Emu*. He had already explained his connection was through his Tasmanian family, not through the Central Victorian Bunurong.\n\n## Awards and Recognition\n\nBruce Pascoe has received many awards for his writing:\n\n- 1999: Fellowship of Australian Writers \u2013 Australian Literature Award for\n*Shark*. - 2013: Prime Minister's Literary Award \u2013 Young Adult Fiction.\n- 2013: Deadly Awards \u2013 Published book of the year.\n- 2016: NSW Premier's Literary Award for\n*Dark Emu*. - 2016: New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards \u2013 Indigenous Writers' Prize.\n- 2018: Australia Council for the Arts \u2013 Lifetime Achievement Award.\n- 2020: Children's Book of the Year Award, Eve Pownall Award for Information Books for\n*Young Dark Emu*. - 2021: Australian Society of Authors \u2013 ASA Medal.\n\nPascoe was nominated as Person of the Year at the National Dreamtime Awards 2018. He was also invited to a special cultural ceremony by Yuin elder Max Dulumunmum Harrison. In the same year, he gave a speech called \"Mother Earth\" for the Eric Rolls Memorial Lecture.\n\n## Bruce Pascoe's Personal Life\n\nIn 1982, Bruce Pascoe separated from his first wife. They have a daughter together. In the same year, he married Lyn Harwood. They have a son. In 2017, Pascoe and Harwood separated. Pascoe said this was because he was away a lot, working on his farming mission.\n\nPascoe lives on a 60-hectare (150-acre) farm called Yumburra. It is near Mallacoota in East Gippsland, on the eastern coast of Victoria. He also works for his family company, Black Duck Foods. This company aims to grow Indigenous produce, like the foods mentioned in *Dark Emu*, to sell. His 2024 book is called *Black Duck \u2013 A Year at Yumburra*.\n\n## Bruce Pascoe's Books\n\nHere is a selection of books written by Bruce Pascoe:\n\n*A Corner Full of Characters*, 1981*Night Animals*, 1986*Fox*, 1988*Ruby-eyed Coucal*, 1996*Wathaurong : Too bloody strong : Stories and life journeys of people from Wathaurong*, 1997*Cape Otway: Coast of secrets*, 1997*Shark*, 1999*Nightjar*, 2000*Earth*, 2001*Ocean*, 2002*Foxies in a Firehose : A piece of doggerel from Warragul*, 2006*The Little Red Yellow Black Book : An introduction to indigenous Australia*, 2008*Fog a Dox*, 2012*Dark Emu: Black Seeds: Agriculture Or Accident?*, 2014*Seahorse*, 2015*Mrs Whitlam*, 2016*Young Dark Emu: A Truer History*, 2019*Salt: Selected Stories and Essays*, 2019*Black Duck \u2013 A Year at Yumburra*, with Lyn Harwood, 2024\n\nHe has also written under the names Murray Gray (*The Great Australian Novel: At Last it's Here*, a funny novel from 1984) and Leopold Glass (*Ribcage: All You Need Is $800,000 \u2013 Quickly*, a detective novel from 1999).\n\n*Kiddle Encyclopedia.*\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boonwurrung\n# Boonwurrung\n\n\n| Total population | |\n|---|---|\nPre contact \u2013 at least 500.[1] | |\n| Regions with significant populations | |\n| Languages | |\n| Boonwurrung language, English | |\n| Religion | |\n| Australian Aboriginal mythology | |\n| Related ethnic groups | |\n| Woiwurrung, Wathaurong, Taungurong, Djadjawurrung |\n\nThe **Boonwurrung**,[2][3] also spelt **Bunurong** or **Bun wurrung**, are an Aboriginal people of the Kulin nation, who are the traditional owners of the land from the Werribee River to Wilsons Promontory in the Australian state of Victoria. Their territory includes part of what is now the city and suburbs of Melbourne. They were called the **Western Port** or **Port Philip tribe** by the early settlers, and were in alliance with other tribes in the Kulin nation, having particularly strong ties to the Wurundjeri people.\n\nThe Registered Aboriginal Party representing the Boonwurrung people is the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation.\n\n## Language\n\n[edit]Boonwurrung is one of the Kulin languages, and belongs to the Pama-Nyungan language family.[4] The ethnonym occasionally used in early writings to refer to the Bunwurrung, namely *Bunwurru*, is derived from the word *bu:n*, meaning \"no\" and *wur:u*, signifying either \"lip\" or \"speech\".[5] This indicates that the Boonwurrung language may not be spoken outside of their country - their clan's territory.[6]\n\n## Country\n\n[edit]The Boonwurrung people are predominantly saltwater people whose lands, waters, and cosmos encompassed some 3,000 square miles (7,800 km2) of territory around Western Port Bay and the Mornington Peninsula. Its western boundary was set at Werribee. To the southeast, it extended from Mordialloc through to Anderson Inlet, as far as Wilson's Promontory. Inland its borders reached the Dandenong Ranges, and ran eastwards as far as the vicinity of Warragul.[5][7][8]\n\n\u201cSaw nothing but grassy country, open forest, plenty gum and wild cherry. Saw where the natives had encamped,\n\nplenty of trees notched where they had climbed for opossums. \u2026There are herds of forest kangaroo immensely large, a short distance from the settlement, also flocks of emus on the western plains fifty and sixty in a drove. \u2026The country through which I travelled to the Salt Water (Maribyrnong) River had a park-like appearance, kangaroo grass being the\n\nprincipal, the trees she-oak, wattle, honeysuckle. Saw a blue flower, thorny appearance. Numerous old native huts.\u201d\n\n\n\u2014 George Robinson 1836. The journals of George Augustus Robinson, chief protector, Port Phillip Aboriginal Protectorate.\n\nIn June 2021, the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation and the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation, both registered Aboriginal Parties, agreed on a redrawing of their traditional boundaries developed by the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council. The new borderline runs across the city from west to east, with the CBD, Richmond and Hawthorn included in Wurundjeri land, and Albert Park, St Kilda and Caulfield on Bunurong land. It was agreed that Mount Cottrell, the site of a massacre in 1836 with at least 10 Wathaurong victims, would be jointly managed above the 160 m (520 ft) line.[9] However these new boundaries are disputed by some Wurundjeri and Boonwurrung people, including N'arweet Carolyn Briggs of the Boonwurrung Land and Sea Council.[10]\n\nIn Boonwurrung belief, their territory was carved out by the creator *Loo-errn* as he moved from Yarra Flats down to his final resting place at *Wamoon* and, as custodians of this *marr-ne-beek* country, they required outsiders to observe certain ritual prohibitions and to learn their language if the newcomers were to enter their land without harm.[11]\n\n## Clan structures\n\n[edit]Communities consisted of six land-owning groups called *clans* that spoke the Boonwurrung language and were connected through cultural and mutual interests, totems, trading initiatives, and marriage ties. Each had an Arweet, or clan leader.[12]\n\nThe clans are:\n\n- Yalukit-willam: East of Werribee River to St Kilda\n- Mayone-bulluk: Carrum Carrum Swamp\n- Ngaruk-Willam: Brighton, Mordialloc, Dandenong, and the area from Mount Martha to Mount Eliza\n- Yallock-Bullock: Bass River and Tooradin\n- Boonwurrung-Bulluk: Point Nepean to Cape Schank\n- Yowenjerre: Tarwin River\n[13]\n\nAccess by other clans to land and resources (such as the Birrarung, or Yarra River) was sometimes restricted depending on the state of the resource in question. For example; if a river or creek had been fished regularly throughout the fishing season and fish supplies were down, fishing was limited or stopped entirely by the clan who owned that resource until fish were given a chance to recover. During this time, other resources were utilised for food. This ensured the sustained use of the resources available to them. As with most other Kulin territories, penalties such as spearings were enforced upon trespassers.[ citation needed]\n\nBoonwurrung moieties classified people either as *Bunjil*, that is eaglehawk, or *Waang*, namely raven.[14]\n\n## History and culture\n\n[edit]### Traditional life\n\n[edit]Information on traditional life has been passed down by Boonwurrung people from one generation to the next, and was also recorded by European settlers and administrators.[6]\n\nThe Yalukit-willam clan of the Boonwurrung were semi-nomadic hunter gatherers who moved around to seasonal food sources in their territory to take advantage of seasonably available food resources. Their hunting equipment and techniques had been highly developed to the environment and they had a highly detailed knowledge of their Country. This knowledge was passed from one generation to the next. They had to work only about five hours a day.[6] Dogs were important and ceremonially buried.[15]\n\nThe Boonwurrung people have oral histories that recount in detail the flooding of Port Phillip Bay ten-thousand years ago. The boundaries of Boonwurrung territory are defined by further floods 5000 years ago. Prior to this time, the bay was scrub-filled and passable on foot, and the Boonwurrung people hunted kangaroo and possums on it.[6]\n\n#### Food and hunting\n\n[edit]The Yalukit-willam would spend up to a few weeks in one spot, depending on the water and food supply. Major camps were often set up close to permanent fresh water, leaving archaeological evidence of the places they lived. These archaeological sites include surface scatters, shell middens, isolated artefacts and burials.[6]\n\nMen were the primary hunters. They hunted kangaroos, possums, kangaroo rats, bandicoots, wombats and lizards. They also caught fish and eels and collected shellfish. Some Boonwurrung people made seasonal trips in canoes to French Island, where they could gather swan eggs.[16] In coastal and swamp areas there was plenty of bird life to hunt, including ducks and swans. There were abundant eels, yabbies, and fish in Stony and Kororoit creeks, and the Yarra River. Men were experts at spearing eels and Robinson notes in his diary in 1841 two men catching 40lbs of eel \"in a very short time\". The coast provided saltwater fish, mussels, cockles and small crabs.[6]\n\nWomen were primarily gatherers. Murnong (or yam daisy) was a favourite food. Others were the black wattle gum, the pith of tree ferns, native cherries, kangaroo apples and various fungi. Murnong grew all year was best eaten in spring. Tubers were collected in vast amounts in string bags. Fresh murnong could be eaten raw, or if less fresh, murnong could be roasted or baked in earth ovens. Murnong used to grow in great amounts along the Kororoit Creek and other creeks in the area and covered the plain to the west.[6] These murnong fields were destroyed by the introduction of sheep. Scholar Bruce Pascoe attributes the widespread fields of murrnong in certain areas to active farming by Aboriginal peoples.[17] Women collected large quantities of tadpoles which were cooked beneath a bed of hot coals.[6]\n\nRobinson's diary describes how the Yalukit-willam caught emus and restrained their dingos.\n\nWhen the natives want to kill emu they get up a cherry tree before daylight with a large spear, and having put a quantity of\n\ncherries in a certain spot under the tree, conceal themselves above with a clear place for them to thrust the spear down. At day dawn the emu is heard coming by the noise it makes, and if this is a tree they have been at before they are sure\n\nto come again, when they begin eating, and then the native thrusts the spear through them. \u2026Saw several wild dogs on the settlement belonging to the country. \u2026The aborigines tie up the fore foot of their dogs to prevent them going astray, instead of roping them round the neck as we do. At the native encampment, I saw two dogs thus tied.\n\n\n\u2014 George Robinson 1840. The journals of George Augustus Robinson, chief protector, Port Phillip Aboriginal Protectorate.\n\n## Early European arrival\n\n[edit]Initial contact was made in February 1801 when Lieutenant Murray and his crew from the *Lady Nelson* came ashore for fresh water near present-day Sorrento. A wary exchange of spears and stone axes for shirts, mirrors and a steel axe, ended when the crew of *Lady Nelson* panicked, resulting in spears flying, musket shots and the use of the ship's cannon, wounding several fleeing Boonwurrung people.[18] The following month, Captain Milius from the French ship *Naturaliste*, in the Baudin expedition, danced alone on a beach at Western Port for the natives, in a much more peaceful contact.[18]\n\nJust before and overlapping the period of British exploration and settlement, the Boonwurrung were involved in a long-running dispute with the Gunai\/Kurnai people from Gippsland. According to William Barak, the last traditional elder of the Wurundjeri people, the conflict was a dispute over resources, which resulted in heavy casualties being suffered by the Boonwurrung. Many Gunnai raids occurred to abduct Boonwurrung women. The Yowengerra had almost been completely annihilated by 1836, largely as a result of attacks from the Gunai.[19] During 1833\u201334, around 60\u201370 Bunurong people, if a report has been correctly interpreted, may have been killed in a raid by Gunai when they were camped to the north of Carrum Carrum Swamp.[20]\n\n### Dispossession\n\n[edit]The Boonwurrung people, living primarily along the Port Phillip and Western Port coast, may have had their livelihoods affected by European seal hunters. The sealers' abduction of Boonwurrung women and taken to Bass Strait Islands and Tasmania may have caused inter-tribal conflicts, and by analogy, this may also apply to the Boonwurrung, whose coastlands were visited by sealers.[21] A report by Jules Dumont d'Urville in 1830 attributed the absence of Boonwurrung on Phillip Island, which was a camp for sealers, as due to the latter's behavior.[22] As late as 1833, nine Woiwurrung and Boonwurrung women, and a boy, Yonki Yonka, were kidnapped and ferried across to the sealers' Bass Strait island bases.[23] Contact with sealers would have exposed the coastal tribes to European diseases, and this would have exercised a heavy impact on demographics, and the economic and social ties binding the Wurundjeri and Boonwurrung peoples, as would the possible effects of infectious diseases contracted from these sealers.[1]\n\nJames Fleming, one of the party of surveyor Charles Grimes in HMS *Cumberland* who explored the Maribyrnong River and the Yarra River as far as Dights Falls in February 1803, reported smallpox scars on several aboriginal people he met, suggesting that a smallpox epidemic might have swept through the tribes around Port Philip before 1803, reducing the population.[24] Broome puts forward that two epidemics of smallpox decimated the population of the Kulin tribes by perhaps killing half each time in the 1790s and again around 1830.[25][a] This theory has been challenged, however, by modern historical diagnosticians, who argue that the observed symptoms in the early ethnographical literature are compatible with impetigo and ringworm.[26]\n\nOne particularly notable person at the time of European settlement in Victoria was Derrimut, a Boonwurrung elder, who informed early European settlers in October 1835 of an impending attack by clans from the Woiwurrung group. The colonists armed themselves, and the attack was averted. Benbow and Billibellary, from the Wurundjeri, also acted to protect the colonists as part of their duty of hospitality. Derrimut later became very disillusioned and died in the Benevolent Asylum at the age of about 54 years in 1864. A few colonists erected a tombstone to Derrimut in Melbourne General Cemetery in his honour.[ citation needed]\n\nBy 1839, the Boonwurrung had been reduced to 80\u201390 people, with only 4 of 19 children under four years old, from a probable pre-contact population of greater than 500 people. By 1850 Protector William Thomas estimated just 28 Bunurong people living on Boonwurrung land.[ citation needed]\n\nIn 1852, the Boonwurrung were allocated 340 hectares (840 acres) at Mordialloc Creek while the Woiwurrung gained 782 hectares along the Yarra at Warrandyte. The Aboriginal reserves were never staffed by whites and were not permanent camps, but acted as distribution depots where rations and blankets were distributed, with the intention being to keep the tribes away from the growing settlement of Melbourne.[27] The Aboriginal Protection Board revoked these two reserves in 1862\u20131863, considering them now too close to Melbourne.[28]\n\nIn March 1863, after three years of upheaval, the surviving Kulin leaders, among them Simon Wonga and William Barak, led forty Wurundjeri, Taungurung (Goulburn River) and Boonwurrung people over the Black Spur and squatted on a traditional camping site on Badger Creek near Healesville and requested ownership of the site. This became Coranderrk Station, named after the Woiwurrung word for the Victorian Christmas bush.[29] Coranderrk was closed in 1924 and its occupants were moved to Lake Tyers in Gippsland.[30]\n\n## Law and war\n\n[edit]Great enmity existed in particular between the Boonwurrung and the eastern Gunai, who were later deemed responsible for playing a role in the drastic reduction of the tribe's population.[31]\n\nInjury or death to a tribal member usually resulted in a conference to assess the facts, and, where thought unlawful, revenge was taken.[32] In 1839, after one or two Boonwurrung\/Woiwurrung were killed, a party of 15 men left for Geelong in order to retaliate against the malefactors, the Wathaurong.[33]\nIn 1840, the Boonwurrung became convinced that a man from a tribe in Echuca had used sorcery to ordain the death of one of their warriors, whose name had been sung while a possum bone discarded after a Boonwurrung meal, and encased in a kangaroo's leg bone, was roasted. Shortly afterward the named Boonwurrung man died, and the tribe revenged itself on the first Echuca tribesman who then came to visit their territory.[3] It was arranged by word of mouth, passing from Echuca through the Nirababaluk and Wurundjeri, for a meeting to have justice done at Merri Creek. Nine or ten of the killed Echuca tribesman's kinsmen threw spears and boomerangs at the Boonwurrung warrior, armed with a shield, until he was wounded in the flank by a reed-spear. An elder of another, observing tribe, the Barababaraba, called it a day, the ordeal ended, and all celebrated a grand corroboree.[34]\n\n## Boonwurrung Dreaming\n\n[edit]- Bunjil and Pallian creation story: Bunjil is the creator spirit of the Kulin people.\n- Birrarung creation story: formation of the Birrarung River.\n\n## Notable people\n\n[edit]- Jack Charles (1943\u2013 2022), actor.\n[35] - Derrimut (c. 1810 \u2013 28 May 1864), arweet \u2013 headman of the Boonwurrung\n- Carolyn Briggs\n- Louisa Briggs\n- Maree Clarke (artist)\n\n## Alternative names\n\n[edit]*Boonerwrung*[36]*Bunuron**Bunurong, Bunwurrung, Boonwerung, Boonoorong*and*Bururong*[37]*Bunwurru**Putnaroo, Putmaroo**Thurung*(an eastern tribal exonym for the Bunjurong, meaning tiger snakes, a metaphor indicating the sneaky way they set up ambushes against the eastern tribes)*Toturin*(a Gunai term for 'black snake, used for several western Boonwurrung tribes[5]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## Notes\n\n[edit]**^**It is attested that in some Victorian tribes, such of those found in the Loddon area the advent of the smallpox was associated with s serpent,*Mindye*, whose maleficence could be conjured by sorcerers to harm people.

On 24 July, the Belgian government had announced that if war came it would uphold its neutrality. The Belgian government mobilised its armed forces on 31 July and a state of heightened alert (*Kriegsgefahr*) was proclaimed in Germany. On 2 August, the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium, demanding passage through the country and German forces invaded Luxembourg. Two days later, the Belgian government refused the German demands and the British government guaranteed military support to Belgium. The German government declared war on Belgium on 4 August; German troops crossed the border and began the Battle of Li\u00e8ge.\n\nGerman military operations in Belgium were intended to bring the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Armies into positions in Belgium from which they could invade France, which, after the fall of Li\u00e8ge on 7 August, led to sieges of Belgian fortresses along the river Meuse at Namur and the surrender of the last forts (16\u201317 August). The government abandoned the capital, Brussels, on 17 August and after fighting on the Gete river, the Belgian field army withdrew westwards to the National Redoubt at Antwerp on 19 August. Brussels was occupied the following day and the siege of Namur began on 21 August.\n\nAfter the Battle of Mons and the Battle of Charleroi, the bulk of the German armies in Belgium marched south into France, leaving small forces to garrison Brussels and the Belgian railways. The III Reserve Corps advanced to the fortified zone around Antwerp and a division of the IV Reserve Corps took over in Brussels. The Belgian field army made several sorties from Antwerp in late August and September to harass German communications and to assist the French and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) by keeping German troops in Belgium. German troop withdrawals to reinforce the main armies in France were postponed to repulse a Belgian sortie from 9 to 13 September and a German corps in transit was retained in Belgium for several days. Belgian resistance and German fear of francs-tireurs led the Germans to implement a policy of terror (*schrecklichkeit*) against Belgian civilians soon after the invasion, in which massacres, executions, hostage-taking and the burning of towns and villages took place and became known as the Rape of Belgium.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Frontiers ended, the French armies in the north and the BEF began the Great Retreat into France (24 August \u2013 28 September), the Belgian army and small detachments of French and British troops fought in Belgium against German cavalry and *J\u00e4ger* (light infantry). On 27 August, a squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) flew to Ostend, to conduct air reconnaissance between Bruges, Ghent and Ypres. Royal Marines landed in France on 19 to 20 September and began scouting unoccupied Belgium in motor cars; an RNAS Armoured Car Section was created by fitting vehicles with bulletproof steel. On 2 October, the Marine Brigade of the Royal Naval Division was moved to Antwerp, followed by the rest of the division on 6 October. From 6 to 7 October, the 7th Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division landed at Zeebrugge and naval forces collected at Dover were formed into the Dover Patrol, to operate in the Channel and off the French\u2013Belgian coast. Despite minor British reinforcement, the siege of Antwerp ended when its defensive ring of forts was destroyed by German super-heavy artillery. The city was abandoned on 9 October and Allied forces withdrew to West Flanders.\n\nAt the end of the Great Retreat, the Race to the Sea (17 September \u2013 19 October) began, a period of reciprocal attempts by German and Franco-British forces to outflank each other, extending the front line northwards from the Aisne, into Picardy, Artois, and Flanders. Military operations in Belgium also moved westwards as the Belgian army withdrew from Antwerp to the area close to the border with France. The Belgian army fought the defensive Battle of the Yser (16\u201331 October) from Nieuwpoort (Nieuport) south to Diksmuide (Dixmude), as the German 4th Army attacked westwards and French, British, and some Belgian troops fought the First Battle of Ypres (19 October \u2013 22 November) against the German 4th and 6th Armies. By November 1914, most of Belgium was under German occupation and Allied naval blockade. A German military administration was established on 26 August 1914, to rule through the pre-war Belgian administrative system, overseen by a small group of German officers and officials. Belgium was divided into administrative zones, the General Government of Brussels and its hinterland; a second zone, under the 4th Army, including Ghent and Antwerp and a third zone under the German Navy along the coastline. The German occupation lasted until late 1918.\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]### Belgian neutrality\n\n[edit]The neutrality of Belgium had been established by the European Great Powers in the London Conference of 1830. The Treaty of London (1839) recognised Belgian independence and neutrality from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands after the Belgian revolution.[1] Until 1911, Belgian strategic analysis anticipated that if war came, the Germans would attack France across the Franco-German border and trap the French armies against the Belgian frontier, as they had done in 1870. British and French guarantees of Belgian independence were made before 1914 but the possibility of landings in Antwerp was floated by the British military attach\u00e9 in 1906 and 1911, which led the Belgians to suspect that the British had come to see Belgian neutrality as a matter of British diplomatic and military advantage, rather than as an end in itself. The Agadir Crisis (1911) left the Belgian government in little doubt as to the risk of a European war and an invasion of Belgium by Germany.[2]\n\nIn September 1911, a government meeting concluded that Belgium must be prepared to resist a German invasion, to avoid accusations of collusion by the British and French governments. Britain, France and the Netherlands were also to continue to be treated as potential enemies.[2] In 1913 and 1914, the Germans made inquiries to the Belgian military attach\u00e9 in Berlin, about the passage of German military forces through Belgium. If invaded, Belgium would need foreign help but would not treat foreign powers as allies or form objectives beyond the maintenance of Belgian independence. Neutrality forced the Belgian government into a strategy of military independence, based on a rearmament programme begun in 1909, which was expected to be complete in 1926. The Belgian plan was to have three army corps, to reduce the numerical advantage of the German armies over the French, intended to deter a German invasion.[3]\n\nConscription was introduced in 1909 but with a reduction in the term of service to fifteen months; the Agadir Crisis made the government continue its preparations but until 1913, the size of the army was not fixed as a proportion of the population. The annual conscription of 13,300 recruits was increased to 33,000 to accumulate the trained manpower for a field army of 180,000 men. Older men would continue to serve as garrison troops and by 1926 about 340,000 men would be available. Implementation of the new scheme had disrupted the old one but had not yet become effective by 1914. During the crisis over the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, regiments were divided and eight conscription classes were incorporated into the army to provide 117,000 men for the field army and 200,000 fortress troops. The Belgian army planned a defence based on interior lines, rather than concentrating the army on the border against a particular threat. Belgian defences were to be based on a National Redoubt at Antwerp, with the field army massed in the centre of the country 60 km (37 mi) from the frontier, ready to manoeuvre to delay an invasion, while the frontiers were protected by the fortified regions of Li\u00e8ge and Namur.[3] The German invasion of Belgium on 4 August 1914, in violation of Article VII of the Treaty of London was the *casus belli*, the reason given by the British government, for declaring war on Germany.[4]\n\n### War plans\n\n[edit]#### Belgian defensive plans\n\n[edit]Belgian military planning was based on the assumption that other powers would oust an invader but the likelihood of a German invasion did not lead to France and Britain being seen as allies or for the Belgian government to do more than protect its independence. The Anglo-French Entente (1904) had led the Belgians to perceive that the British attitude to Belgium had changed and that it was now seen as a protectorate. A Belgian General Staff was formed in 1910 but the *Chef d'\u00c9tat-Major G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Arm\u00e9e*, Lieutenant-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Harry Jungbluth was retired on 30 June 1912 and not replaced until May 1914 by Lieutenant-General Chevalier Antonin de Selliers de Moranville. Moranville began planning for the concentration of the army and met railway officials on 29 July.[5]\n\nBelgian troops were to be massed in central Belgium, in front of the National Redoubt at Antwerp ready to face any border, while the fortified position of Li\u00e8ge and fortified position of Namur were left to secure the frontiers. On mobilisation, the King became Commander-in-Chief and chose where the army was to concentrate. Amid the disruption of the new rearmament plan the disorganised and poorly trained Belgian conscripts would benefit from a central position to delay contact with an invader. The army would also need fortifications for defence but these had been built on the frontier. Another school of thought wanted a return to a frontier deployment, in line with French theories of the offensive. The Belgian plan that emerged was a compromise in which the field army concentrated behind the Gete river with two divisions forward at Li\u00e8ge and Namur.[5]\n\n#### Germany: Schlieffen\u2013Moltke Plan\n\n[edit]German strategy had given priority to offensive operations against France and a defensive posture against Russia since 1891. German planning was determined by numerical inferiority, the speed of mobilisation and concentration and the effect of the vast increase of the power of modern weapons. Frontal attacks were expected to be costly and protracted, leading to limited success, particularly after the French and Russians modernised their fortifications on the frontiers with Germany. Alfred von Schlieffen, Chief of the Imperial German General Staff (*Oberste Heeresleitung*, OHL, the German army high command) from 1891 to 1906, devised a plan to evade the French frontier fortifications with an offensive on the northern flank, which would have a local numerical superiority and obtain rapidly a decisive victory. By 1898\u20131899, such a manoeuvre was intended swiftly to pass between Antwerp and Namur and threaten Paris from the north.[6]\n\nHelmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and was less certain that the French would conform to German assumptions. Moltke adapted the deployment and concentration plan to accommodate an attack in the centre or an enveloping attack from both flanks as variants, by adding divisions to the left (southern) flank opposite the French frontier, from the c. 1,700,000 men expected to be mobilised in the *Westheer* (Western Army). The main German force would still advance through Belgium and attack southwards into France, the French armies would be enveloped on the left and pressed back over the Meuse, Aisne, Somme, Oise, Marne, and Seine, by short, rapid attacks, unable to withdraw into central France. The French would either be annihilated or the manoeuvre from the north would create conditions for victory in the centre or in Lorraine, on the common border.[7]\n\nA corollary to the emphasis on the Western Front was lack of troops for the Eastern Front against Russia. In the east the Germans planned a defensive strategy and relied on the 8th Army to defend East Prussia and on the Austro-Hungarian Army (*Landstreitkr\u00e4fte \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns*\/*Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1ri \u00e9s Kir\u00e1lyi Hadsereg*) to divert the Russians from eastern Germany with offensives in Galicia, while France was being crushed. Divisions from the German army in the west (*Westheer*) would be moved eastwards to deal with the Russians as soon as a breathing-space was gained against the French.[8]\n\n#### France: Plan XVII\n\n[edit]Under Plan XVII the French peacetime army was to form five field armies, with a group of reserve divisions attached to each army and a group of reserve divisions on each flank, a military force of c. 2,000,000 men. The armies were to concentrate opposite the German frontier around \u00c9pinal, Nancy and Verdun\u2013Mezi\u00e8res, with an army in reserve around Ste. M\u00e9n\u00e9hould and Commercy. Since 1871, railway building had given the French General Staff sixteen lines to the German frontier, against thirteen available to the German army and the French could afford to wait until German intentions were clear. The French deployment was intended to be ready for a German offensive in Lorraine or through Belgium. It was anticipated that the Germans would use reserve troops but also expected that a large German army would be mobilised on the border with Russia, leaving the western army with sufficient troops only to advance through Belgium south of the Meuse and Sambre rivers. French intelligence had obtained a 1905 map exercise of the German general staff, in which German troops had gone no further north than Namur and assumed that plans to besiege Belgian forts were a defensive measure against the Belgian army.[9]\n\nA German attack from south-eastern Belgium towards M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and a possible offensive from Lorraine towards Verdun, Nancy and St. Di\u00e9 was anticipated; the plan was an evolution from Plan XVI and made more provision for the possibility of a German offensive from the north through Belgium. The First, Second and Third armies were to concentrate between \u00c9pinal and Verdun opposite Alsace and Lorraine, the Fifth Army was to assemble from Montm\u00e9dy to Sedan and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and the Fourth Army was to be held back west of Verdun, ready to move east to attack the southern flank of a German invasion through Belgium or southwards against the northern flank of an attack through Lorraine. No formal provision was made for combined operations with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but joint arrangements had been made and in 1911 during the Second Moroccan Crisis, the French had been told that six British divisions could be expected to operate around Maubeuge.[10]\n\n## Outbreak of war\n\n[edit]On 28 June the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated and on 5 July the Kaiser promised \"the full support of Germany\" if Austria-Hungary took action against Serbia. On 23 July the Austro-Hungarian Government sent an ultimatum to Serbia and next day the British Foreign Minister Sir Edward Grey proposed a conference to avert a war and the Belgian Government issued a declaration that Belgium would defend its neutrality \"whatever the consequences\". On 25 July the Serbian Government ordered mobilisation and on 26 July, the Austro-Hungarian Government ordered partial mobilisation against Serbia. The French and Italian governments accepted British proposals for a conference on 27 July but the next day Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and the German government rejected the British proposal for a conference. On 29 July the Russian government ordered partial mobilisation against Austria-Hungary as hostilities commenced between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. The German government made proposals to secure British neutrality; the Admiralty sent a *Warning Telegram* to the Fleets and the War Office ordered the *Precautionary Period*. On 30 July the British government rejected German proposals for British neutrality and next day the Austro-Hungarian and Russian governments ordered full mobilisation.[11]\n\nAt midnight on 31 July\/1 August the German government sent an ultimatum to Russia and announced a state of *\"Kriegsgefahr\"* during the day; the Ottoman government ordered mobilisation and the London Stock Exchange closed. On 1 August the British government ordered the mobilisation of the Navy, the German government ordered general mobilisation and declared war on Russia. Hostilities commenced on the Polish frontier, the French government ordered general mobilisation and next day the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium demanding passage through Belgian territory, as German troops crossed the frontier of Luxembourg. Military operations began on the French frontier, Libau was bombarded by a German cruiser SMS *Augsburg* and the British government guaranteed naval protection for French coasts. On 3 August the Belgian Government refused German demands and the British government guaranteed military support to Belgium should the German army invade. Germany declared war on France, the British government ordered general mobilisation and Italy declared neutrality. On 4 August the British government sent an ultimatum to Germany and declared war on Germany at midnight on 4\/5 August Central European Time. Belgium severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Germany declared war on Belgium. German troops crossed the Belgian frontier and attacked Li\u00e8ge.[12]\n\n## Battles\n\n[edit]### Battle of Li\u00e8ge, 5\u201316 August\n\n[edit]The Battle of Li\u00e8ge was the primary engagement in the German invasion of Belgium and the first battle of World War I. The attack on the city began on 5 August and lasted until 16 August, when the last fort was surrendered. The German invasion led the British to declare war and the length of the siege may have delayed the German invasion of France by 4\u20135 days. Railways needed by the German armies in eastern Belgium were closed during the early part of the siege and by the morning of 17 August, the German 1st, 2nd and 3rd armies were free to resume their advance to the French frontier, yet German troops only appeared in strength before Namur on 20 August.[13] The Belgian field army withdrew from the Gete towards Antwerp from 18\u201320 August and Brussels was captured unopposed on 20 August. The siege of Li\u00e8ge had lasted for eleven days, rather than the two days anticipated by the Germans.[13]\n\nBelgian military operations in the east of the country had delayed German plans, which some writers claimed had been advantageous to the Franco-British forces in northern France and in Belgium.[13] Wolfgang F\u00f6rster wrote that the German timetable of deployment had required its armies to reach a line from Thionville to Sedan and Mons by the 22nd day of mobilisation (23 August), which was achieved ahead of schedule. In *Bulletin Belge des Sciences Militaires*, a four-day delay was claimed.[13] John Buchan wrote that \"The triumph was moral \u2013 an advertisement to the world that the ancient faiths of country and duty could still nerve the arm for battle, and that the German idol, for all its splendour, had feet of clay.\"[14] In 2007, Foley called the neutralisation of the Belgian defences at Li\u00e8ge sufficient to enable the German right wing to squeeze through, a small bump in the road for the Germans, who had mobilised in two weeks and were ready to invade France by 20 August.[15]\n\n### Battle of Halen, 12 August 1914\n\n[edit]The Battle of Halen (Haelen) was fought by mounted and dismounted cavalry and other forces on 12 August 1914 between German forces, led by Georg von der \n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Western_Front_(World_War_I)\n# Western Front (World War I)\n\n\n| Western Front | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Part of the European theatre of World War I | |||||||\nClockwise from top left: Men of the Royal Irish Rifles, concentrated in the trench, right before going over the top on the First day on the Somme; British soldier carries a wounded comrade from the battlefield on the first day of the Somme; A young German soldier during the Battle of Ginchy; American infantry storming a German bunker; A German Gotha G.IV heavy bomber; American troops with Renault FT tanks moving in the Argonne Forest to the front line during the Meuse\u2013Argonne offensive | |||||||\n| |||||||\n| Belligerents | |||||||\n|\nUnited Kingdom and Empire\n| Austria-Hungary | ||||||\n| Commanders and leaders | |||||||\n| Strength | |||||||\n13,250,000[1] | |||||||\n| Casualties and losses | |||||||\n7,500,000\n|\n5,500,000\n|\n\nThe **Western Front** was one of the main theatres of war during World War I. Following the outbreak of war in August 1914, the German Army opened the Western Front by invading Luxembourg and Belgium, then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France. The German advance was halted with the Battle of the Marne. Following the Race to the Sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France, the position of which changed little except during early 1917 and again in 1918.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1917 there were several offensives along this front. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances. Entrenchments, machine gun emplacements, barbed wire, and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties during attacks and counter-attacks and no significant advances were made. Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun, in 1916, with a combined 700,000 casualties, the Battle of the Somme, also in 1916, with over a million casualties, and the Battle of Passchendaele, in 1917, with 487,000 casualties.[10][11]\n\nTo break the deadlock of the trench warfare on the Western Front, both sides tried new military technology, including poison gas, aircraft, and tanks. The adoption of better tactics and the cumulative weakening of the armies in the west led to the return of mobility in 1918. The German spring offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that ended the war of the Central Powers against Russia and Romania on the Eastern Front. Using short, intense \"hurricane\" bombardments and infiltration tactics, the German armies moved nearly 100 kilometres (60 miles) to the west, the deepest advance by either side since 1914, but the success was short-lived.\n\nThe unstoppable advance of the entente armies during the Hundred Days Offensive of 1918 caused a sudden collapse of the German armies and persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable. The German government surrendered in the Armistice of 11 November 1918, and the terms of peace were settled by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n\n## 1914\n\n[edit]### War plans \u2013 Battle of the Frontiers\n\n[edit]The Western Front was the place where the most powerful military forces in Europe, the German and French armies, met and where the First World War was decided.[12] At the outbreak of the war, the German Army, with seven field armies in the west and one in the east, executed a modified version of the Schlieffen Plan, bypassing French defenses along the common border by moving quickly through neutral Belgium, and then turning southwards to attack France and attempt to encircle the French Army and trap it on the German border.[13] Belgian neutrality had been guaranteed by Britain under the Treaty of London, 1839; this caused Britain to join the war at the expiration of its ultimatum at midnight on 4 August. Armies under German generals Alexander von Kluck and Karl von B\u00fclow attacked Belgium on 4 August 1914. Luxembourg had been occupied without opposition on 2 August. The first battle in Belgium was the Battle of Li\u00e8ge, a siege that lasted from 5\u201316 August. Li\u00e8ge was well fortified and surprised the German Army under B\u00fclow with its level of resistance. German heavy artillery was able to demolish the main forts within a few days.[14] Following the fall of Li\u00e8ge, most of the Belgian field army retreated to Antwerp, leaving the garrison of Namur isolated, with the Belgian capital, Brussels, falling to the Germans on 20 August. Although the German army bypassed Antwerp, it remained a threat to their flank. Another siege followed at Namur, lasting from about 20\u201323 August.[15]\n\nThe French deployed five armies on the frontier. The French Plan XVII was intended to bring about the capture of Alsace\u2013Lorraine.[16] On 7 August, the VII Corps attacked Alsace to capture Mulhouse and Colmar. The main offensive was launched on 14 August with the First and Second Armies attacking toward Sarrebourg-Morhange in Lorraine.[17] In keeping with the Schlieffen Plan, the Germans withdrew slowly while inflicting severe losses upon the French. The French Third and Fourth Armies advanced toward the Saar and attempted to capture Saarburg, attacking Briey and Neufchateau but were repulsed.[18] The French VII Corps captured Mulhouse after a brief engagement first on 7 August, and then again on 23 August, but German reserve forces engaged them in the Battle of Mulhouse and forced the French to retreat twice.[19]\n\nThe German Army swept through Belgium, executing civilians and razing villages. The application of \"collective responsibility\" against a civilian population further galvanised the entente. Newspapers condemned the German invasion, violence against civilians and destruction of property, which became known as the \"Rape of Belgium.\"[20][d] After marching through Belgium, Luxembourg and the Ardennes, the Germans advanced into northern France in late August, where they met the French Army, under Joseph Joffre, and the divisions of the British Expeditionary Force under Field Marshal Sir John French. A series of engagements known as the Battle of the Frontiers ensued, which included the Battle of Charleroi and the Battle of Mons. In the former battle the French Fifth Army was almost destroyed by the German 2nd and 3rd Armies and the latter delayed the German advance by a day. A general entente retreat followed, resulting in more clashes at the Battle of Le Cateau, the Siege of Maubeuge and the Battle of St. Quentin (also called the First Battle of Guise).[22]\n\n### First Battle of the Marne\n\n[edit]The German Army came within 70 km (43 mi) of Paris but at the First Battle of the Marne (6\u201312 September), French and British troops were able to force a German retreat by exploiting a gap which appeared between the 1st and 2nd Armies, ending the German advance into France.[23] The German Army retreated north of the Aisne and dug in there, establishing the beginnings of a static western front that was to last for the next three years. Following this German retirement, the opposing forces made reciprocal outflanking manoeuvres, known as the Race to the Sea and quickly extended their trench systems from the Swiss frontier to the North Sea.[24] The territory occupied by Germany held 64 percent of French pig-iron production, 24 percent of its steel manufacturing and 40 percent of the coal industry \u2013 dealing a serious blow to French industry.[25]\n\nOn the entente side (those countries opposing the German alliance), the final lines were occupied with the armies of each nation defending a part of the front. From the coast in the north, the primary forces were from Belgium, the British Empire and then France. Following the Battle of the Yser in October, the Belgian army controlled a 35 km (22 mi) length of West Flanders along the coast, known as the Yser Front, along the Yser and the Ieperlee from Nieuwpoort to Boezinge.[26] Meanwhile, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) occupied a position on the flank, having occupied a more central position.[27]\n\n### First Battle of Ypres\n\n[edit]From 19 October until 22 November, the German forces made their final breakthrough attempt of 1914 during the First Battle of Ypres, which ended in a mutually-costly stalemate.[28] After the battle, Erich von Falkenhayn judged that it was no longer possible for Germany to win the war by purely military means and on 18 November 1914 he called for a diplomatic solution. The Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg; *Generalfeldmarschall* Paul von Hindenburg, commanding *Ober Ost* (Eastern Front high command); and his deputy, Erich Ludendorff, continued to believe that victory was achievable through decisive battles. During the Lodz offensive in Poland (11\u201325 November), Falkenhayn hoped that the Russians would be made amenable to peace overtures. In his discussions with Bethmann Hollweg, Falkenhayn viewed Germany and Russia as having no insoluble conflict and that the real enemies of Germany were France and Britain. A peace with only a few annexations of territory also seemed possible with France and that with Russia and France out of the war by negotiated settlements, Germany could concentrate on Britain and fight a long war with the resources of Europe at its disposal. Hindenburg and Ludendorff continued to believe that Russia could be defeated by a series of battles which cumulatively would have a decisive effect, after which Germany could finish off France and Britain.[29]\n\n### Trench warfare\n\n[edit]Trench warfare in 1914, while not new, quickly improved and provided a very high degree of defense. According to two prominent historians:\n\nTrenches were longer, deeper, and better defended by steel, concrete, and barbed wire than ever before. They were far stronger and more effective than chains of forts, for they formed a continuous network, sometimes with four or five parallel lines linked by interfacings. They were dug far below the surface of the earth out of reach of the heaviest artillery.... Grand battles with the old maneuvers were out of the question. Only by bombardment, sapping, and assault could the enemy be shaken, and such operations had to be conducted on an immense scale to produce appreciable results. Indeed, it is questionable whether the German lines in France could ever have been broken if the Germans had not wasted their resources in unsuccessful assaults, and the blockade by sea had not gradually cut off their supplies. In such warfare no single general could strike a blow that would make him immortal; the \"glory of fighting\" sank down into the dirt and mire of trenches and dugouts.\n\n[30]\n\n## 1915\n\n[edit]Between the coast and the Vosges was a westward bulge in the trench line, named the Noyon salient after the French town at the maximum point of the German advance near Compi\u00e8gne. Joffre's plan for 1915 was to attack the salient on both flanks to cut it off.[31] The Fourth Army had attacked in Champagne from 20 December 1914 \u2013 17 March 1915 but the French were not able to attack in Artois at the same time. The Tenth Army formed the northern attack force and was to attack eastwards into the Douai plain on a 16 km (9.9 mi) front between Loos and Arras.[32] On 10 March, as part of the larger offensive in the Artois region, the British Army fought the Battle of Neuve Chapelle to capture Aubers Ridge. The assault was made by four divisions on a 2 mi (3.2 km) front. Preceded by a hurricane bombardment lasting only 35 minutes, the village was captured within four hours. The advance then slowed because of supply and communication difficulties. The Germans brought up reserves and counterattacked, forestalling the attempt to capture the ridge. Since the British had used about a third of their artillery ammunition, General Sir John French blamed the failure on the Shell Crisis of 1915, despite the early success.[33][34]\n\n### Gas warfare\n\n[edit]All sides had signed the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which prohibited the use of chemical weapons in warfare. In 1914, there had been small-scale attempts by both the French and Germans to use various tear gases, which were not strictly prohibited by the early treaties but which were also ineffective.[35] The first use of more lethal chemical weapons on the Western Front was against the French near the Belgian town of Ypres. The Germans had already deployed gas against the Russians in the east at the Battle of Humin-Bolim\u00f3w.[36]\n\nDespite the German plans to maintain the stalemate with the French and British, Albrecht, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, commander of the 4th Army planned an offensive at Ypres, site of the First Battle of Ypres in November 1914. The Second Battle of Ypres, April 1915, was intended to divert attention from offensives in the Eastern Front and disrupt Franco-British planning. After a two-day bombardment, the Germans released a lethal cloud of 168 long tons (171 t) of chlorine onto the battlefield. Though primarily a powerful irritant, it can asphyxiate in high concentrations or prolonged exposure. Being heavier than air, the gas crept across no man's land and drifted into the French trenches.[37] The green-yellow cloud started killing some defenders and those in the rear fled in panic, creating an undefended 3.7-mile (6 km) gap in the entente line. The Germans were unprepared for the level of their success and lacked sufficient reserves to exploit the opening. Canadian troops on the right drew back their left flank and halted the German advance.[38] The gas attack was repeated two days later and caused a 3.1 mi (5 km) withdrawal of the Franco-British line but the opportunity had been lost.[39]\n\nThe success of this attack would not be repeated, as the entente countered by introducing gas masks and other countermeasures. An example of the success of these measures came a year later, on 27 April in the Gas attacks at Hulluch 40 km (25 mi) to the south of Ypres, where the 16th (Irish) Division withstood several German gas attacks.[40] The British retaliated, developing their own chlorine gas and using it at the Battle of Loos in September 1915. Fickle winds and inexperience led to more British casualties from the gas than German.[41] French, British and German forces all escalated the use of gas attacks through the rest of the war, developing the more deadly phosgene gas in 1915, then the infamous mustard gas in 1917, which could linger for days and could kill slowly and painfully. Countermeasures also improved and the stalemate continued.[42]\n\n### Air warfare\n\n[edit]Specialised aeroplanes for aerial combat were introduced in 1915. Aircraft were already in use for scouting and on 1 April, the French pilot Roland Garros became the first to shoot down an enemy aircraft by using a machine-gun that shot forward through the propeller blades. This was achieved by crudely reinforcing the blades to deflect bullets.[43] Several weeks later Garros force-landed behind German lines. His aeroplane was captured and sent to Dutch engineer Anthony Fokker, who soon produced a significant improvement, the interrupter gear, in which the machine gun is synchronised with the propeller so it fires in the intervals when the blades of the propeller are out of the line of fire. This advance was quickly ushered into service, in the Fokker E.I (*Eindecker*, or monoplane, Mark 1), the first single seat fighter aircraft to combine a reasonable maximum speed with an effective armament. Max Immelmann scored the first confirmed kill in an *Eindecker* on 1 August.[44] Both sides developed improved weapons, engines, airframes and materials, until the end of the war. It also inaugurated the cult of the ace, the most famous being Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron). Contrary to the myth, anti-aircraft fire claimed more kills than fighters.[45]\n\n### Spring offensive\n\n[edit]The final entente offensive of the spring was the Second Battle of Artois, an offensive to capture Vimy Ridge and advance into the Douai plain. The French Tenth Army attacked on 9 May after a six-day bombardment and advanced 5 kilometres (3 mi) to capture Vimy Ridge. German reinforcements counter-attacked and pushed the French back towards their starting points because French reserves had been held back and the success of the attack had come as a surprise. By 15 May the advance had been stopped, although the fighting continued until 18 June.[46] In May the German Army captured a French document at La Ville-aux-Bois describing a new system of defence. Rather than relying on a heavily fortified front line, the defence was to be arranged in a series of echelons. The front line would be a thinly manned series of outposts, reinforced by a series of strongpoints and a sheltered reserve. If a slope was available, troops were deployed along the rear side for protection. The defence became fully integrated with command of artillery at the divisional level. Members of the German high command viewed this new scheme with some favour and it later became the basis of an elastic defence in depth doctrine against entente attacks.[47][48]\n\nDuring the autumn of 1915, the \"Fokker Scourge\" began to have an effect on the battlefront as entente reconnaissance aircraft were nearly driven from the skies. These reconnaissance aircraft were used to direct gunnery and photograph enemy fortifications but now the entente were nearly blinded by German fighters.[49] However, the impact of German air superiority was diminished by their primarily defensive doctrine in which they tended to remain over their own lines, rather than fighting over entente held territory.[50]\n\n### Autumn offensive\n\n[edit]In September 1915 the entente launched another offensive, with the French Third Battle of Artois, Second Battle of Champagne and the British at Loos. The French had spent the summer preparing for this action, with the British assuming control of more of the front to release French troops for the attack. The bombardment, which had been carefully targeted by means of aerial photography,[51] began on 22 September. The main French assault was launched on 25 September and, at first, made good progress in spite of surviving wire entanglements and machine gun posts. Rather than retreating, the Germans adopted a new defence-in-depth scheme that consisted of a series of defensive zones and positions with a depth of up to 8.0 km (5 mi).[52]\n\nOn 25 September, the British began the Battle of Loos, part of the Third Battle of Artois, which was meant to supplement the larger Champagne attack. The attack was preceded by a four-day artillery bombardment of 250,000 shells and a release of 5,100 cylinders of chlorine gas.[53][54] The attack involved two corps in the main assault and two corps performing diversionary attacks at Ypres. The British suffered heavy losses, especially due to machine gun fire during the attack and made only limited gains before they ran out of shells. A renewal of the attack on 13 October fared little better.[55] In December, French was replaced by General Douglas Haig as commander of the British forces.[56]\n\n## 1916\n\n[edit]Falkenhayn believed that a breakthrough might no longer be possible and instead focused on forcing a French defeat by inflicting massive casualties.[57] His new goal was to \"bleed France white.\"[58] As such, he adopted two new strategies. The first was the use of unrestricted submarine warfare to cut off entente supplies arriving from overseas.[59] The second would be attacks against the French army intended to inflict maximum casualties; Falkenhayn planned to attack a position from which the French could not retreat, for reasons of strategy and national pride and thus trap the French. The town of Verdun was chosen for this because it was an important stronghold, surrounded by a ring of forts, that lay near the German lines and because it guarded the direct route to Paris.[60]\n\nFalkenhayn limited the size of the front to 5\u20136 kilometres (3\u20134 mi) to concentrate artillery firepower and to prevent a breakthrough from a counter-of\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trench_warfare\n# Trench warfare\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification. (December 2022) |\n\n\n| Part of a series on |\n| War (outline) |\n|---|\n\n**Trench warfare** is a type of land warfare using occupied lines largely comprising military trenches, in which combatants are well-protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. It became archetypically associated with World War I (1914\u20131918), when the Race to the Sea rapidly expanded trench use on the Western Front starting in September 1914.[1]\n\nTrench warfare proliferated when a revolution in firepower was not matched by similar advances in mobility, resulting in a grueling form of warfare in which the defender held the advantage.[2] On the Western Front in 1914\u20131918, both sides constructed elaborate trench, underground, and dugout systems opposing each other along a front, protected from assault by barbed wire. The area between opposing trench lines (known as \"no man's land\") was fully exposed to artillery fire from both sides. Attacks, even if successful, often sustained severe casualties.\n\nThe development of armoured warfare and combined arms tactics permitted static lines to be bypassed and defeated, leading to the decline of trench warfare after the war. Following World War I, \"trench warfare\" became a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges, and futility in conflict.[3]\n\n## Precursors\n\n[edit]Field works have existed for as long as there have been armies.[ citation needed] Roman legions, when in the presence of an enemy, entrenched camps nightly when on the move.\n\n[4]The Roman general Belisarius had his soldiers dig a trench as part of the Battle of Dara in 530 AD.\n\nTrench warfare was also documented during the defence of Medina in a siege known as the Battle of the Trench (627 AD). The architect of the plan was Salman the Persian who suggested digging a trench to defend Medina.\n\nThere are examples of trench digging as a defensive measure during the Middle Ages in Europe, such as during the Piedmontese Civil War, where it was documented that on the morning of May 12, 1640, the French soldiers, having already captured the left bank of the Po river and gaining control of the bridge connecting the two banks of the river, and wanting to advance to the Capuchin Monastery of the Monte, deciding that their position wasn't secure enough for their liking, then choose to advance on a double attack on the trenches, but were twice repelled. Eventually, on the third attempt, the French broke through and the defenders were forced to flee with the civilian population, seeking the sanctuary of the local Catholic church, the Santa Maria al Monte dei Cappuccini, in Turin, also known at that time as the Capuchin Monastery of the Monte.[5]\n\nIn early modern warfare, troops used field works to block possible lines of advance.[6] Examples include the Lines of Stollhofen, built at the start of the War of the Spanish Succession of 1702\u20131714,[7] the Lines of Weissenburg built under the orders of the Duke of Villars in 1706,[8] the Lines of Ne Plus Ultra during the winter of 1710\u20131711,[6] and the Lines of Torres Vedras in 1809 and 1810.[4]\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Dahomey made use of trenches to defend against Oyo attacks. In one engagement against Oyo, Dahomey placed one corp to face the trench and another on the flank. While battling Oyo forces, the flanking squad launched attacks and withdrew to the trenches afterwards.[9]\n\nDuring the New Zealand Wars, the M\u0101ori utilized trench and bunker systems as part of fortified areas known as p\u0101.[10][11] According to one British observer, \"the fence round the pa is covered between every paling with loose bunches of flax, against which the bullets fall and drop; in the night they repair every hole made by the guns\".[12][13][14] In the 1980s, historian James Belich claimed that the M\u0101ori had effectively invented trench warfare during the first stages of the New Zealand Wars, claims which have been as described as \"baseless... revisionism\".[15] Some sources claim that M\u0101ori trenches influenced 20th-century trench warfare.[16][17]\n\nThe Crimean War (1853\u20131856) saw \"massive trench works and trench warfare\",[18] even though \"the modernity of the trench war was not immediately apparent to the contemporaries\".[19]\n\nUnion and Confederate armies employed field works and extensive trench systems in the American Civil War (1861\u20131865) \u2014 most notably in the sieges of Vicksburg (1863) and Petersburg (1864\u20131865), the latter of which saw the first use by the Union army of the rapid-fire Gatling gun,[20] the important precursor to modern-day machine guns. Trenches were also utilized in the Paraguayan War (which started in 1864), the Second Anglo-Boer War (1899\u20131902), and the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905).\n\n## Adoption\n\n[edit]Although technology had dramatically changed the nature of warfare by 1914, the armies of the major combatants had not fully absorbed the implications. Fundamentally, as the range and rate of fire of rifled small-arms increased, a defender shielded from enemy fire (in a trench, at a house window, behind a large rock, or behind other cover) was often able to kill several approaching foes before they closed around the defender's position. Attacks across open ground became even more dangerous after the introduction of rapid-firing artillery, exemplified by the \"French 75\", machine gun and high explosive fragmentation rounds. The increases in firepower had outstripped the ability of infantry (or even cavalry) to cover the ground between firing lines and the ability of armour to withstand fire. It would take a revolution in mobility to change that.[21]\n\nThe French and the Imperial German Army adopted different tactical doctrines: the French relied on the attack with speed and surprise (Attaque \u00e0 outrance) and the Germans relied on firepower, investing heavily in howitzers and machine guns. The British lacked an official tactical doctrine, with an officer corps that rejected theory in favour of pragmatism.[22]\n\nWhile the armies expected to use entrenchments and cover, they did not allow for the effect of defences in depth. They required a deliberate approach to seizing positions from which fire support could be given for the next phase of the attack, rather than a rapid move to break the enemy's line.[23] It was assumed that artillery could still destroy entrenched troops, or at least suppress them sufficiently for friendly infantry and cavalry to manoeuvre.[24]\n\nDigging-in when defending a position was a standard practice by the start of WWI. To attack frontally was to court crippling losses, so an outflanking operation was the preferred method of attack against an entrenched enemy. After the Battle of the Aisne in September 1914, an extended series of attempted flanking moves, and matching extensions to the fortified defensive lines, developed into the \"race to the sea\", by the end of which German and Allied armies had produced a matched pair of trench lines from the Swiss border in the south to the North Sea coast of Belgium.\n\nBy the end of October 1914, the whole front in Belgium and France had solidified into lines of trenches, which lasted until the last weeks of the war. Mass infantry assaults were futile in the face of artillery fire, as well as rapid rifle and machine-gun fire. Both sides concentrated on breaking up enemy attacks and on protecting their own troops by digging deep into the ground.[25] After the buildup of forces in 1915, the Western Front became a stalemated struggle between equals, to be decided by attrition. Frontal assaults, and their associated casualties, became inevitable because the continuous trench lines had no open flanks. Casualties of the defenders matched those of the attackers, as vast reserves were expended in costly counter-attacks or exposed to the attacker's massed artillery. There were periods in which rigid trench warfare broke down, such as during the Battle of the Somme, but the lines never moved very far. The war would be won by the side that was able to commit the last reserves to the Western Front. Trench warfare prevailed on the Western Front until the Germans launched their Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918.[26] Trench warfare also took place on other fronts, including in Italy and at Gallipoli.\n\nArmies were also limited by logistics. The heavy use of artillery meant that ammunition expenditure was far higher in WWI than in any previous conflict. Horses and carts were insufficient for transporting large quantities over long distances, so armies had trouble moving far from railheads. This greatly slowed advances, making it impossible for either side to achieve a breakthrough that would change the war. This situation would only be altered in WWII with greater use of motorized vehicles.[27][28]\n\n-\nTrenches of the 11th Cheshire Regiment at Ovillers-la-Boisselle, on the Somme, July 1916.

They were far stronger and more effective than chains of forts, for they formed a continuous network, sometimes with four or five parallel lines linked by interfacings. They were dug far below the surface of the earth out of reach of the heaviest artillery....Grand battles with the old maneuvers were out of the question.

In such warfare no single general could strike a blow that would make him immortal; the \"glory of fighting\" sank down into the dirt and mire of trenches and dugouts.\n\n\n\u2014 James Harvey Robinson and Charles A. Beard, The Development Of Modern Europe Volume II The Merging Of European Into World History[29]\n\nEarly World War I trenches were simple. They lacked traverses, and according to pre-war doctrine were to be packed with men fighting shoulder to shoulder. This doctrine led to heavy casualties from artillery fire. This vulnerability, and the length of the front to be defended, soon led to frontline trenches being held by fewer men. The defenders augmented the trenches themselves with barbed wire strung in front to impede movement; wiring parties went out every night to repair and improve these forward defences.[30]\n\nThe small, improvised trenches of the first few months grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. They resisted both artillery bombardment and mass infantry assault. Shell-proof dugouts became a high priority.[31]\n\nA well-developed trench had to be at least 2.5 m (8 ft) deep to allow men to walk upright and still be protected.\n\nThere were three standard ways to dig a trench: entrenching, sapping, and tunneling. Entrenching, where a man would stand on the surface and dig downwards, was most efficient, as it allowed a large digging party to dig the full length of the trench simultaneously. However, entrenching left the diggers exposed above ground and hence could only be carried out when free of observation, such as in a rear area or at night. Sapping involved extending the trench by digging away at the end face. The diggers were not exposed, but only one or two men could work on the trench at a time. Tunnelling was like sapping except that a \"roof\" of soil was left in place while the trench line was established and then removed when the trench was ready to be occupied.[32][ page needed] The guidelines for British trench construction stated that it would take 450 men 6 hours at night to complete 250 m (270 yd) of front-line trench system. Thereafter, the trench would require constant maintenance to prevent deterioration caused by weather or shelling.\n\nTrenchmen were a specialized unit of trench excavators and repairmen. They usually dug or repaired in groups of four with an escort of two armed soldiers. Trenchmen were armed with one 1911 semi-automatic pistol, and were only utilized when either a new trench needed to be dug or expanded quickly, or when a trench was destroyed by artillery fire. Trenchmen were trained to dig with incredible speed; in a dig of three to six hours they could accomplish what would take a normal group of frontline infantry soldiers around two days. Trenchmen were usually looked down upon by fellow soldiers because they did not fight. They were usually called cowards because if they were attacked while digging, they would abandon the post and flee to safety. They were instructed to do this though because through the war there were only around 1,100 trained trenchmen. They were highly valued only by officers higher on the chain of command.\n\n### Components\n\n[edit]The banked earth on the lip of the trench facing the enemy was called the parapet and had a fire step. The embanked rear lip of the trench was called the parados, which protected the soldier's back from shells falling behind the trench. The sides of the trench were often revetted with sandbags, wire mesh, wooden frames and sometimes roofs.[33] The floor of the trench was usually covered by wooden duckboards. In later designs the floor might be raised on a wooden frame to provide a drainage channel underneath. Due to the substantial casualties taken from indirect fire, some trenches were reinforced with corrugated metal roofs over the top as an improvised defence from shrapnel.[34]\n\nThe static movement of trench warfare and a need for protection from snipers created a requirement for loopholes both for discharging firearms and for observation.[35] Often a steel plate was used with a \"keyhole\", which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.[35] German snipers used armour-piercing bullets that allowed them to penetrate loopholes. Another means to see over the parapet was the trench periscope \u2013 in its simplest form, just a stick with two angled pieces of mirror at the top and bottom. A number of armies made use of the periscope rifle, which enabled soldiers to snipe at the enemy without exposing themselves over the parapet, although at the cost of reduced shooting accuracy. The device is most associated with Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli, where the Turks held the high ground.\n\nDugouts of varying degrees of comfort were built in the rear of the support trench. British dugouts were usually 2.5 to 5 m (8 to 16 ft) deep. The Germans, who had based their knowledge on studies of the Russo-Japanese War,[36] made something of a science out of designing and constructing defensive works. They used reinforced concrete to construct deep, shell-proof, ventilated dugouts, as well as strategic strongpoints. German dugouts were typically much deeper, usually a minimum of 4 m (12 ft) deep and sometimes dug three stories down, with concrete staircases to reach the upper levels.\n\n### Layout\n\n[edit]Trenches were never straight but were dug in a zigzagging or stepped pattern, with all straight sections generally kept less than ten yards. Later, this evolved to have the combat trenches broken into distinct fire bays connected by traverses. While this isolated the view of friendly soldiers along their own trench, this ensured the entire trench could not be enfiladed if the enemy gained access at any one point; or if a bomb, grenade, or shell landed in the trench, the blast could not travel far.\n\nVery early in the war, British defensive doctrine suggested a main trench system of three parallel lines, interconnected by communications trenches. The point at which a communications trench intersected the front trench was of critical importance, and it was usually heavily fortified. The front trench was lightly garrisoned and typically occupied in force only during \"stand to\" at dawn and dusk. Between 65 and 90 m (70 and 100 yd) behind the front trench was located the support (or \"travel\") trench, to which the garrison would retreat when the front trench was bombarded.\n\nBetween 90 and 270 metres (100 and 300 yd) further to the rear was located the third reserve trench, where the reserve troops could amass for a counter-attack if the front trenches were captured. This defensive layout was soon rendered obsolete as the power of artillery grew; however, in certain sectors of the front, the support trench was maintained as a decoy to attract the enemy bombardment away from the front and reserve lines. Fires were lit in the support line to make it appear inhabited and any damage done immediately repaired.\n\nTemporary trenches were also built. When a major attack was planned, assembly trenches would be dug near the front trench. These were used to provide a sheltered place for the waves of attacking troops who would follow the first waves leaving from the front trench. \"Saps\" were temporary, unmanned, often dead-end utility trenches dug out into no-man's land. They fulfilled a variety of purposes, such as connecting the front trench to a listening post close to the enemy wire or providing an advance \"jumping-off\" line for a surprise attack. When one side's front line bulged towards the opposition, a salient was formed. The concave trench line facing the salient was called a \"re-entrant.\" Large salients were perilous for their occupants because they could be assailed from three sides.\n\nBehind the front system of trenches there were usually at least two more partially prepared trench systems, kilometres to the rear, ready to be occupied in the event of a retreat. The Germans often prepared multiple redundant trench systems; in 1916 their Somme front featured two complete trench systems, one kilometre apart, with a third partially completed system a further kilometre behind. This duplication made a decisive breakthrough virtually impossible. In the event that a section of the first trench system was captured, a \"switch\" trench would be dug to connect the second trench system to the still-held section of the first.\n\n### Wire\n\n[edit]The use of lines of barbed wire, razor wire, and other wire obstacles, in belts 15 m (49 ft) deep or more, is effective in stalling infantry travelling across the battlefield. Although the barbs or razors might cause minor injuries, the purpose was to entangle the limbs of enemy soldiers, forcing them to stop and methodically pull or work the wire off, likely taking several seconds, or even longer. This is deadly when the wire is emplaced at points of maximum exposure to concentrated enemy firepower, in plain sight of enemy fire bays and machine guns. The combination of wire and firepower was the cause of most failed attacks in trench warfare and their very high casualties. Liddell Hart identified barbed wire and the machine gun as the elements that had to be broken to regain a mobile battlefield.\n\nA basic wire line could be created by draping several strands of barbed wire between wooden posts driven into the ground. Loose lines of wire can be more effective in entangling than tight ones, and it was common to use the coils of barbed wire as delivered only partially stretched out, called concertina wire. Placing and repairing wire in no man's land relied on stealth, usually done at night by special wiring parties, who could also be tasked with secretly sabotaging enemy wires. The screw picket, invented by the Germans and later adopted by the Allies during the war, was quieter than driving stakes. Wire often stretch\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Armistice_of_11_November_1918\n# Armistice of 11 November 1918\n\n\nThe **Armistice of 11 November 1918** was the armistice that ended fighting on land, at sea, and in the air in World War I between the Entente and their last remaining opponent, Germany. It was signed in a railroad car in the Compi\u00e8gne Forest, near the town of Compi\u00e8gne. Previous armistices had been agreed with Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. It was concluded after the German government sent a message to American president Woodrow Wilson to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared \"Fourteen Points\", which later became the basis of the German surrender at the Paris Peace Conference, which took place the following year.\n\nAlso known as the **Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne** (French: *Armistice de Compi\u00e8gne*, German: *Waffenstillstand von Compi\u00e8gne*) from the town near the place where it was officially agreed to at 5:00 a.m. by the Allied Supreme Commander, French Marshal Ferdinand Foch,[1] it came into force at 11:00 a.m. Paris Time (11:00 UT) on 11 November 1918 and marked a victory for the Entente and a defeat for Germany, although not formally a surrender.\n\nThe actual terms, which were largely written by Foch, included the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front, the withdrawal of German forces from west of the Rhine, Entente occupation of the Rhineland and bridgeheads further east, the preservation of infrastructure, the surrender of aircraft, warships, and military materiel, the release of Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians, eventual reparations, no release of German prisoners and no relaxation of the naval blockade of Germany. The armistice was extended three times while negotiations continued on a peace treaty. The Treaty of Versailles, which was officially signed on 28 June 1919, took effect on 10 January 1920.\n\nFighting continued up until 11 a.m. UT on 11 November 1918, with 2,738 men dying on the last day of the war.[2]\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]### Deteriorating situation for the Germans\n\n[edit]The military situation for the Central Powers had been deteriorating rapidly since the Battle of Amiens at the beginning of August 1918, which precipitated a German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line and loss of the gains of the German spring offensive.[3] The Allied advance, later known as the Hundred Days Offensive, entered a new stage on 28 September, when a massive United States and French attack opened the Meuse\u2013Argonne offensive, while to the north, the British were poised to assault at the St Quentin Canal, threatening a giant pincer movement.[4]\n\nMeanwhile, the Ottoman Empire was close to exhaustion, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was in chaos, and on the Macedonian front, resistance by the Bulgarian Army had collapsed, leading to the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September.[5] With the collapse of Bulgaria, and Italian victory in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the road was open to an invasion of Germany from the south via Austria.[6] In Germany, chronic food shortages caused by the Allied blockade were increasingly leading to discontent and disorder.[7] Although morale on the German front line was reasonable, battlefield casualties, starvation rations and Spanish flu had caused a desperate shortage of manpower, and those recruits that were available were war-weary and disaffected.[8]\n\n### October 1918 telegrams and inter-Allied negotiations\n\n[edit]On 29 September 1918, the German Supreme Army Command at Imperial Army Headquarters at Spa in occupied Belgium, informed Emperor Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor, Count Georg von Hertling, that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless. Quartermaster General Erich Ludendorff claimed that he could not guarantee that the front would hold for another two hours. Stating that the collapse of Bulgaria meant that troops destined for the Western Front would have to be diverted there, and this had \"fundamentally changed the situation in view of the attacks being launched on the Western Front\", Ludendorff demanded a request be given to the Entente for an immediate ceasefire.[9] In addition, he recommended the acceptance of the main demands of US president Woodrow Wilson (the Fourteen Points) including putting the Imperial Government on a democratic footing, hoping for more favorable peace terms. This enabled him to save the face of the Imperial German Army and put the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences squarely into the hands of the democratic parties and the parliament. He expressed his view to officers of his staff on 1 October: \"They now must lie on the bed that they've made for us.\"[10]\n\nOn 3 October 1918, the liberal Prince Maximilian of Baden was appointed Chancellor of Germany,[11] replacing Georg von Hertling in order to negotiate an armistice.[12] After long conversations with the Kaiser and evaluations of the political and military situations in the Reich, by 5 October 1918 the German government sent a message to Wilson to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared \"Fourteen Points\". In the subsequent two exchanges, Wilson's allusions \"failed to convey the idea that the Kaiser's abdication was an essential condition for peace. The leading statesmen of the Reich were not yet ready to contemplate such a monstrous possibility.\"[13] As a precondition for negotiations, Wilson demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and the Kaiser's abdication, writing on 23 October: \"If the Government of the United States must deal with the military masters and the monarchical autocrats of Germany now, or if it is likely to have to deal with them later in regard to the international obligations of the German Empire, it must demand not peace negotiations but surrender.\"[14]\n\nIn late October 1918, Ludendorff, discovering that the Allies' proposed armistice terms were much harsher than he had anticipated, now demanded the resumption of the war which he himself had declared lost only one month earlier. Germany's position however had further weakened since that time. Desertions were on the increase and Germany's allies were all on the verge of capitulation. The Kaiser dismissed Ludendorff and replaced him with Lieutenant General Wilhelm Groener, who recommended that the government continue in its intentions to seek an armistice.\n\nOn 3 November 1918, Berlin was notified that both Turkey and Austria-Hungary had concluded armistices with the Allies. General von Gallwitz had described this eventuality as being \"decisive\" to the Chancellor in discussions some weeks before, as it would mean that Austrian territory would become a spring-board for an Allied attack on Germany from the south. Revolution broke out across Germany the following day, together with a mutiny in the German High Seas Fleet. On 5 November, the Allies agreed to take up negotiations for a truce.[15][16]\n\nThe latest note from Wilson was received in Berlin on 6 November 1918. That same day, the delegation led by Matthias Erzberger departed for France.[17] Aware that the refusal of the Kaiser to abdicate was a sticking-point in negotiations with the Allies as well as an impetus to revolution within Germany, Prince Max on his own authority announced that the Kaiser had abdicated and handed over power to Friedrich Ebert of the Social Democratic Party on 9 November. The same day, Philipp Scheidemann, also a Social Democrat, declared Germany a republic.[18]\n\nWhilst the Germans sought negotiations along the lines of Wilson's 14 points, the French, British and Italian governments had no desire to accept them and President Wilson's subsequent unilateral promises. For example, they assumed that the de-militarization suggested by Wilson would be limited to the Central Powers. There were also contradictions with their post-War plans that did not include a consistent implementation of the ideal of national self-determination.[19] As Czernin points out:\n\nThe Allied statesmen were faced with a problem: so far they had considered the \"fourteen commandments\" as a piece of clever and effective American propaganda, designed primarily to undermine the fighting spirit of the Central Powers, and to bolster the morale of the lesser Allies. Now, suddenly, the whole peace structure was supposed to be built up on that set of \"vague principles\", most of which seemed to them thoroughly unrealistic, and some of which, if they were to be seriously applied, were simply unacceptable.\n\n[20]\n\nTo address this impasse Wilson suggested that the military chiefs be consulted. Douglas Haig, representing the British forces, urged moderation, stating that \"Germany is not broken in the military sense\", that \"it is necessary to grant Germany conditions that they can accept\", and that surrender of occupied territories and Alsace-Lorraine would be \"sufficient to seal the victory\". The British also took the position that the German army should be kept mobilised as a counter to the spread of communist agitation. Ferdinand Foch, speaking for the French forces, agreed with Haig that the Germans \"could undoubtedly take up a new position, and we could not prevent it\", but, contrary to Haig, urged stringent terms including an occupation of the Rhineland with Allied bridgeheads over the Rhine, and the surrender of large quantities of military materiel. General Pershing, commander of the American forces, opposed any armistice being granted to the Germans. The combined effect of this feedback was to nullify Wilson's 14 points.[21]\n\n### German Revolution\n\n[edit]The sailors' revolt that took place during the night of 29 to 30 October 1918 in the port of Wilhelmshaven spread across Germany within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November and to the announcement of the abdication of Wilhelm II.[a] Workers' and soldiers' councils took control in most major cities west of the Elbe, including Berlin, where the new Reich government, the socialist-dominated Council of the People's Deputies, had their full support.[22] One of the primary goals of the councils was an immediate end to the war.[23]\n\nAlso on 9 November, Max von Baden handed the office of chancellor to Friedrich Ebert, a Social Democrat who the same day became co-chair of the Council of the People's Deputies.[24] Two days later, on behalf of the new government, Matthias Erzberger of the Catholic Centre Party signed the armistice at Compi\u00e8gne. The German High Command pushed the blame for the surrender away from the Army and onto others, including the socialists who were supporting and running the government in Berlin.[25] In the eyes of the German Right, the blame was carried over to the Weimar Republic when it was established in 1919. This resulted in a considerable amount of instability in the new republic.[26]\n\n## Negotiation process\n\n[edit]The Armistice was the result of a hurried and desperate process. The German delegation headed by Erzberger crossed the front line in five cars and was escorted for ten hours across the devastated war zone of Northern France, arriving on the morning of 8 November 1918. They were then taken to the secret destination aboard Foch's private train parked in a railway siding in the Forest of Compi\u00e8gne.[27]\n\nFoch appeared only twice in the three days of negotiations: on the first day, to ask the German delegation what they wanted, and on the last day, to see to the signatures. The Germans were handed the list of Allied demands and given 72 hours to agree. The German delegation discussed the Allied terms not with Foch, but with other French and Allied officers. The Armistice amounted to substantial German demilitarization (see list below), with few promises made by the Allies in return. The naval blockade of Germany was not completely lifted until complete peace terms could be agreed upon.[28][29]\n\nThere were very few negotiations. The Germans were able to correct a few impossible demands (for example, the decommissioning of more submarines than their fleet possessed), extend the schedule for the withdrawal and register their formal protest at the harshness of Allied terms. But they were in no position to refuse to sign. On Sunday, 10 November 1918, the Germans were shown newspapers from Paris to inform them that the Kaiser had abdicated. That same day, Ebert instructed Erzberger to sign. The cabinet had earlier received a message from Paul von Hindenburg, head of the German High Command, requesting that the armistice be signed even if the Allied conditions could not be improved on.[30][31]\n\nThe Armistice was agreed upon at 5:00 a.m. on 11 November 1918, to come into effect at 11:00 a.m. Paris Time (noon Berlin Time, 11:00 UT),[32][33] for which reason the occasion is sometimes referred to as \"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\". Signatures were made, depending on the source of information, between 5:00 a.m. and 5:45 a.m. Paris time.[ citation needed]\n\n### Allied Rhineland occupation\n\n[edit]The occupation of the Rhineland took place following the Armistice. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces.\n\n## Prolongation\n\n[edit]The Armistice was prolonged three times before peace was finally ratified. During this period it was also developed.\n\n- First Armistice (11 November 1918 \u2013 13 December 1918)\n- First prolongation of the armistice (13 December 1918 \u2013 16 January 1919)\n- Second prolongation of the armistice (16 January 1919 \u2013 16 February 1919)\n- Tr\u00e8ves Agreement, 17 January 1919\n[34]\n\n- Tr\u00e8ves Agreement, 17 January 1919\n- Third prolongation of the armistice (16 February 1919 \u2013 10 January 1920)\n[35]- Brussels Agreement, 14 March 1919\n[36]\n\n- Brussels Agreement, 14 March 1919\n\nPeace was ratified at 4:15 p.m. on 10 January 1920.[37]\n\n## Key personnel\n\n[edit]For the Allies, the personnel involved were all military. The two signatories were:[32]\n\n- Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch, the Allied supreme commander\n- First Sea Lord Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss, the British representative\n\nOther members of the delegation included:\n\n- General Maxime Weygand, Foch's chief of staff (later French commander-in-chief in 1940)\n- Rear-Admiral George Hope, Deputy First Sea Lord\n- Captain Jack Marriott, British naval officer, Naval Assistant to the First Sea Lord\n\nFor Germany, the four signatories were:[32]\n\n- Matthias Erzberger, a civilian politician\n- Count Alfred von Oberndorff, from the Foreign Ministry\n- Major General Detlof von Winterfeldt, army\n- Captain Ernst Vanselow, navy\n\nIn addition, the German delegation was accompanied by two translators:[38]\n\n- Captain Geyser\n- Cavalry Captain (Rittmeister) von Helldorff\n\n## Terms\n\n[edit]Among its 34 clauses, the armistice contained the following major points:[39]\n\nA. Western Front\n\n- Termination of hostilities on the Western Front, on land and in the air, within six hours of signature.\n[32] - Immediate evacuation of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Alsace\u2013Lorraine within 15 days. Sick and wounded may be left for Allies to care for.\n[32] - Immediate repatriation of all inhabitants of those four territories in German hands.\n[32] - Surrender of mat\u00e9riel: 5,000 artillery pieces, 25,000 machine guns, 3,000\n*minenwerfer*, 1,700 aircraft (including all night bombers), 5,000 railway locomotives, 150,000 railway carriages and 5,000 road trucks.[32] - Evacuation of territory on the west side of the Rhine plus 30 km (19 mi) radius bridgeheads of the east side of the Rhine at the cities of Mainz, Koblenz, and Cologne within 31 days.\n[32] - Vacated territory to be occupied by Allied troops, maintained at Germany's expense.\n[32] - No removal or destruction of civilian goods or inhabitants in evacuated territories and all military mat\u00e9riel and premises to be left intact.\n[32] - All minefields on land and sea to be identified.\n[32] - All means of communication (roads, railways, canals, bridges, telegraphs, telephones) to be left intact, as well as everything needed for agriculture and industry.\n[32]\n\nB. Eastern and African Fronts\n\n- Immediate withdrawal of all German troops in Romania and in what were the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Russian Empire back to German territory as it was on 1 August 1914, although tacit support was given to the pro-German West Russian Volunteer Army under the guise of combating the Bolsheviks. The Allies to have access to these countries.\n[32] - Renunciation of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Russia and of the Treaty of Bucharest with Romania.\n[32] - Evacuation of German forces in Africa.\n[32]\n\nC. At sea\n\n- Immediate cessation of all hostilities at sea and surrender intact of all German submarines within 14 days.\n[32] - Listed German surface vessels to be interned within 7 days and the rest disarmed.\n[32] - Free access to German waters for Allied ships and for those of the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.\n[32] - The naval blockade of Germany to continue.\n[32] - Immediate evacuation of all Black Sea ports and handover of all captured Russian vessels.\n[32]\n\nD. General\n\n- Immediate release of all Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians, without reciprocity.\n[40] - Pending a financial settlement, surrender of assets looted from Belgium, Romania and Russia.\n[32]\n\n## Aftermath\n\n[edit]The British public was notified of the armistice by a subjoined official communiqu\u00e9 issued from the Press Bureau at 10:20 a.m., when British Prime Minister David Lloyd George announced: \"The armistice was signed at five o'clock this morning, and hostilities are to cease on all fronts at 11 a.m. to-day.\"[41] An official communique was published by the United States at 2:30 pm: \"In accordance with the terms of the Armistice, hostilities on the fronts of the American armies were suspended at eleven o'clock this morning.\"[42]\n\nNews of the armistice being signed was officially announced towards 9:00 a.m. in Paris. One hour later, Foch, accompanied by a British admiral, presented himself at the Ministry of War, where he was immediately received by Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France. At 10:50 a.m., Foch issued this general order: \"Hostilities will cease on the whole front as from November 11 at 11 o'clock French time. The Allied troops will not, until further order, go beyond the line reached on that date and at that hour.\"[43] Five minutes later, Clemenceau, Foch and the British admiral went to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. At the first shot fired from the Eiffel Tower, the Ministry of War and the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace displayed flags, while bells around Paris rang. Five hundred students gathered in front of the Ministry and called upon Clemenceau, who appeared on the balcony. Clemenceau exclaimed \"Vive la France!\" \u2013 the crowd echoed him. At 11:00 a.m., the first peace-gunshot was fired from Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien, which told the population of Paris that the armistice was concluded, but the population were already aware of it from official circles and newspapers.[44]\n\nAlthough the information about the imminent ceasefire had spread among the forces at the front in the hours before, fighting in many sections of the front continued right until the appointed hour. At 11 a.m., there was some spontaneous fraternization between the two sides but in general, reactions were muted. A British corporal reported: \"...the Germans came from their trenches, bowed to us and then went away. That was it. There was nothing with which we could celebrate, except cookies.\"[45] On the Allied side, euphoria and exultation were rare. There was some cheering and applause, but the dominant feeling was silence and emptiness after 52 exhausting months of war.[45] According to Thomas R. Gowenlock, an intelligence officer with the U.S. First Division, shelling from both sides continued during the rest of the day, ending only at nightfall.[46][47]\n\nThe peace between the Allies and Germany was subsequently settled in 1919, by the Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles that same year.[ cita\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pauline_Oliveros\n# Pauline Oliveros\n\nPauline Oliveros | |\n|---|---|\n| Born | Houston, Texas, U.S. | May 30, 1932\n| Died | November 24, 2016 Kingston, New York, U.S. [1] | (aged 84)\n| Occupations |\n|\n| Known for | Deep Listening Band |\n| Spouse | Carole Ione Lewis |\n\n**Pauline Oliveros** (May 30, 1932 \u2013 November 24, 2016)[2] was an American composer and accordionist.\n\nConsidered a central figure in the development of post-war experimental and electronic music, she was a founding member of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in the early 1960s, and served as its director. She taught music at Mills College, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Oliveros authored books, formulated new music theories, and investigated new ways to focus attention on music including her concepts of \"deep listening\"[3] and \"sonic awareness\", drawing on metaphors from cybernetics.[4][5] She was an Eyebeam resident.\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]Pauline Oliveros was born in Houston, Texas, on May 30, 1932.[6] She was of Tejana descent.[7] She started to play music as early as kindergarten,[8] and at nine years of age she began to play the accordion, received from her mother, a pianist, because of its popularity in the 1940s.[8] She later went on to learn violin, piano, tuba, and French horn for grade school and college music. At the age of sixteen she resolved to become a composer.[9]\n\nOliveros arrived in California[ when?] and supported herself with a day job, and supplemented this by giving accordion lessons.\n\n[8]From there Oliveros went on to attend the University of Houston, studying with Willard A. Palmer. While attending the University of Houston, she was a member of the band program and helped form the Tau chapter of Tau Beta Sigma Honorary Band Sorority.\n\nShe earned a BFA in composition from San Francisco State College, where her teachers included composer Robert Erickson, with whom she had private lessons and who mentored her for six to seven years. During this period she met San Francisco-based musicians Terry Riley, Stuart Dempster, and Loren Rush, with whom she would later collaborate.[8][10]\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]When Oliveros turned 21, she obtained her first tape recorder, which led to her creating her own electroacoustic pieces.[10] Oliveros was one of the original members of the San Francisco Tape Music Center, which was an important resource for electronic music on the west coast of the United States during the 1960s.[11] The Center later moved to Mills College, with Oliveros serving as its first director; there it was renamed the Center for Contemporary Music.[12]\n\nOliveros often improvised with the *Expanded Instrument System*, an electronic signal processing system she designed, in her performances and recordings.[13] Oliveros held Honorary Doctorates in Music from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Mills College, and De Montfort University.\n\nIn 1967, Oliveros left Mills to take a position at the University of California, San Diego.[8] There, Oliveros met theoretical physicist and karate master Lester Ingber, with whom she collaborated in defining the attentional process as applied to music listening.[14] She also studied karate under Ingber, achieving black belt level. In 1973, Oliveros conducted studies at the university's one-year-old Center for Music Experiment; she served as the center's director from 1976 to 1979. In 1981, to escape creative constriction,[15] she left her tenured position at UCSD and relocated to upstate New York to become an independent composer, performer, and consultant.[16]\n\nIn 1987, Oliveros had the tuning of her accordion changed from equal temperament to just intonation.[17] She sings and plays the retuned accordion (without electronics) in the 1993 opera *Agamemnon*.\n\nOliveros was a member of Avatar Orchestra Metaverse, a global collaboration of composers, artists and musicians that approaches the virtual reality platform *Second Life* as an instrument itself.[18]\n\n## Deep listening\n\n[edit]In 1988, as a result of descending 14 feet (4.3 m) into the Dan Harpole underground cistern in Port Townsend, Washington, to make a recording, Oliveros coined the term \"deep listening\"[8]\u2014a pun that blossomed into \"an aesthetic...designed to inspire both trained and untrained performers to practice the art of listening and responding to environmental conditions in solo and ensemble situations\".[19] Stuart Dempster, Oliveros and Panaiotis then formed the Deep Listening Band, and deep listening became a program of the Pauline Oliveros Foundation, founded in 1985. The Deep Listening program includes annual listening retreats in Europe, New Mexico and in upstate New York, as well as apprenticeship and certification programs. The Pauline Oliveros Foundation changed its name to Deep Listening Institute, Ltd., in 2005. The Deep Listening Band, which included Oliveros, David Gamper (1947\u20132011) and Stuart Dempster, specializes in performing and recording in resonant or reverberant spaces such as caves, cathedrals and huge underground cisterns. They have collaborated with Ellen Fullman and her long-string instrument, as well as countless other musicians, dancers and performers. The Center for Deep Listening at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, initially under the direction of Tomie Hahn, is the steward of the former Deep Listening Institute. A celebratory concert was held on March 11, 2015, at the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic.[20]\n\n## Sonic awareness\n\n[edit]Heidi Von Gunden[21] names a new musical theory developed by Oliveros, \"sonic awareness\", and describes it as \"the ability to consciously focus attention upon environmental and musical sound\", requiring \"continual alertness and an inclination to be always listening\" and which she describes as comparable to John Berger's concept of visual consciousness (as in his *Ways of Seeing*).[22] Oliveros discusses this theory in the \"Introductions\" to her *Sonic Meditations* and in articles. Von Gunden describes sonic awareness as \"a synthesis of the psychology of consciousness, the physiology of the martial arts, and the sociology of the feminist movement\",[23] and describes two ways of processing information, \"attention and awareness\",[23] or focal attention and global attention, which may be represented by a dot and circle, respectively, a symbol Oliveros commonly employs in compositions such as *Rose Moon* (1977) and *El Rilicario de los Animales* (1979).[23] (The titles of Oliveros' pieces *Rose Moon* and *Rose Mountain* refer to her romantic partner Linda Montano having gone by Rose Mountain at one time.[24]) Later this representation was expanded, with the symbol quartered and the quarters representing \"actively making sound\", \"actually imagining sound\", \"listening to present sound\" and \"remembering past sound\", with this model used in *Sonic Meditations*.[25] Practice of the theory creates \"complex sound masses possessing a strong tonal center\".[26]\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]Oliveros was openly lesbian.[27] In 1975 Oliveros met her eventual partner, performance artist Linda Montano.[28] The titles of Oliveros' pieces *Rose Moon* and *Rose Mountain* refer to Montano having gone by Rose Mountain at one time.[24] In her later years, Oliveros developed a 32-year romantic partnership and creative collaboration with sound artist IONE (Carole Lewis).[29] The couple worked together on several major musical theatre productions, dance operas, and films.[30] Sound artist Maria Chavez, a friend and mentee of Pauline, describes Pauline and Ione: \"when you saw them together, you saw love.\"[7]\n\nOliveros was also a patron of Soundart Radio in Dartington, Devon, England.\n\n## Death\n\n[edit]She died in 2016 in Kingston, New York.[6]\n\n## Awards and honors\n\n[edit]- 1994 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award\n[31] - 2007, Resounding Vision Award from Nameless Sound\n- 2009, recipient of the William Schuman Award, from Columbia University School of the Arts\n- 2012, John Cage Award from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts\n[31] - In 2025, Long Beach Opera dedicated its entire season to the works of Pauline Oliveros, reflecting her growing posthumous influence and recognition as a pioneering composer and innovator in experimental music.\n[32]\n\n## Notable works\n\n[edit]*Sonic Meditations*: \"Teach Yourself to Fly\", etc.*Sound Patterns*for mixed chorus (1961), awarded the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in 1962, available on*Extended Voices*(Odyssey 32 16) 0156 and*20th Century Choral Music*(Ars Nova AN-1005)*I of IV*, included in the collection*New Sounds in Electronic Music*, published by Odyssey Records, 1967- Music for Annie Sprinkle's\n*The Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop\u2014Or How To Be A Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps*(1992) *Theater of Substitution*series (1975\u2013?). Oliveros was photographed as different characters, including a Spanish se\u00f1ora, a polyester clad suburban housewife, and a professor in robes. Jackson Mac Low played Oliveros at the New York Philharmonic's \"A Celebration of Women composers\" concert on November 10, 1975, and Oliveros has played Mac Low (see Mac Low's \"being Pauline: narrative of a substitution\",*Big Deal*, Fall 1976).

The Singapore Workforce Development Agency and Council for Private Education was restructured to form SSG on 3 October 2016.\n\nPreviously established under the Private Education Act, the CPE was sanctioned with the legislative power to regulate the private education sector in Singapore. Now, the CPE is appointed by the SSG Board to carry out its functions and powers relating to private education under the Private Education Act. The CPE is supported by a team of staff from SSG to regulate the sector, provide student services, consumer education and facilitate capability development efforts to uplift standards in the local private education industry. The regulatory initiative continues to comprise the mandatory Enhanced Registration Framework[1] (ERF) which sets out the basic standards that a **Private Education Institution** (**PEI**) would need to adhere to in order to operate.\n\nWhile private schools are required to register with the CPE, this is not an endorsement or accreditation of the school.[2] Employers, organisations and individuals are to discrete the various school qualifications for recognition and acceptance purposes.[3]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]In September 2009, the Private Education Act was passed in the Parliament of Singapore with the aim of strengthening and levelling up the quality of the private education sector through an enhanced registration framework and enforcement. The Act also provided for the establishment of the Committee for Private Education (CPE) to oversee a new regulatory function. The CPE began its operations on 21 December 2009.\n\n## EduTrust Certification Scheme\n\n[edit]The EduTrust Certification Scheme (**EduTrust**) is a quality assurance scheme that differentiate private schools according to their quality in education and improvements leading to a good education outcome. There are 7 criteria that the scheme covers, with 3 types of Certification Awards.[4]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Enhanced Registration Framework (ERF)\".**^**\"About CPE\". CPE.

The \u201cTitre d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur\u201d is a Master of Science and Engineering ; then it opens the way to doctoral studies and is a highly priced degree by companies.\n\n\nMost Grandes Ecoles also offer a variety of other graduate, doctoral and executive programmes.\n\nBroad theoretical knowledge combined with practical training make Grandes Ecoles students particularly adaptable beyond their field of specialisation. Students are continuously supervised and assessed to maintain low failure and low drop out rates.\n\n\nEmployment surveys regularly demonstrate that the graduates from Grandes Ecoles get the easiest access to qualified jobs with the best salaries : typically, about 50% of them get a job contract in the same time as they graduate.\n\n** The \u201cDipl\u00f4me d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieur\u201d curriculum**\n\nGraduate engineering studies corresponds to 300 credits in the European ECTS credit system ; most students get their degree in 5 years.\n\n\nPreparatory courses: 2 years (120 ECTS)\n\n\nThe first 2 years provide the student with a strong grounding in science (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science) : these undergraduate courses take place in the so-called \u201cclasses pr\u00e9paratoires aux Grandes Ecoles\u201d. They prepare students for a nationwide competitive entrance examination for the Grandes Ecoles.\n\n\nEngineering cycle: 3 years (180 ECTS)\n\n\nDuring the last 3 years, the multidisciplinary approach of the Grandes Ecoles combines the fundamentals of engineering with technical and applied training as well as humanities and social sciences and a gradual specialisation in a specific field of engineering.\n\nSome engineering schools have a 5-year curriculum, meaning that the preparatory courses are integrated in their programme. About 20% of the students entering the engineering cycle are recruited from other university curricula after a competitive examination or are foreign students recruited in the frame of exchange programs with foreign universities.\n\nTo obtain the \u201ctitre d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur\u201d a minimum stay of 2 years in the French institution within the engineering cycle is required; these 2 years may include a 6-month project and\/or a 6-month supervised internship in industry (in France or abroad).\n\n**Awarded degrees in Engineering and Science**\n\nAll the curricula offered by the Grandes Ecoles include a strong and broad theoretical basis, with a research orientation.

There is however further possibility to join the ENIB later on after 2 years of studies in an IUT or at the University, the selection being on academic records.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]- 1961 - Creation of the ENIB (in 4 years).\n- 1987 - In 5 years.

Widely reported in the media, it was the first incident of large scale public unrest in a French suburb, and marked the first time cars were burned as a protest in France. In 1983, France was experiencing a wave of racist crimes, particularly perpetrated against African immigrants from The Maghreb (for example, the murder of Habib Grimzi, stabbed in a train and then defenestrated, a crime committed by three army soldiers with racist motivations).\nOn 21 March 1983 a police raid led to violent confrontation between a group of young people of Les Minguettes and the police. Demanding the end to police intimidation, a hunger strike began. On 21 June 1983, during a police raid, a police officer shot and seriously injured Toumi Dja\u00efdja, the young president of the association *SOS Avenir Minguettes* (SOS Minguettes\u2019 Future).[1][2][3][4][5] In response, the idea of a nonviolent march emerged in order to attempt to reduce tensions between the police and the youth of Les Minguettes.\nPriest Christian Delorme (called Minguettes\u2019 priest, in French: *Cur\u00e9 des Minguettes*) and pastor Jean Costil, organised an extended, non-violent march, inspired by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.'s demonstrations calling for the end of segregation in the United States and those of Mahatma Gandhi for Indian independence from the United Kingdom. They demanded equal rights, and an end to injustice and social inequality.[6]\n\n## Political context\n\n[edit]In 1983, during the Dreux\u2019s local election, the National Front (French: *Front National* (*FN*)) won the first round of the elections, with 16.72% of votes. So far, the National Front was electorally marginal (only 0.35% of votes during the legislative election of 1981). For the second round, the list of the political party of Jacques Chirac, the Rally for the Republic (French: *Rassemblement Pour la R\u00e9publique* (*RPR*)) decided to merge with the FN list. This merger was approved by Jacques Chirac, who declared: \"I would not have been embarrassed at all to vote for the RPR-FN list for the second round. It does not matter to have four municipal councillors from the FN in Dreux, compared to the four communist Ministers in the Council of Ministers\". In the right-wing parties, only two leaders disagreed with this alliance: Simone Veil and Bernard Stasi, both from the centre-right Union for French Democracy (French: *Union pour la D\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise*, UDF), a traditional ally of RPR. These elections made the news at this time, as it was the first time a far-right political party won a significant election in France since the beginning of the French Fifth Republic, and also the first time that a major right-wing party made an alliance with a far-right party.[7][8][9][10]\n\nWhile there is a racist climate in the right-wing parties, a similar stigmatizing climate was experienced in the left-wing parties, especially in the Socialist Party (French: *Parti Socialiste* (*PS*)) who governed the country. In 1983, the Socialist Prime Minister of France Pierre Mauroy, the Minister of the Interior Gaston Defferre, and the Minister of Labour Jean Auroux said about the strikers of the CGT's syndicate from the factory of Renault-Billancourt, that they are mainly \"immigrants workers\", and accused them of being manipulated by \"integrists\". Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy also declared that the strikers from Renault \"are agitated by religious and political group which behave according to criteria that have nothing to do with the French social reality\". The Franco-Algerian sociologist Abdelmalek Sayad wrote that \"we underestimate how much immigrants workers suffered from the tense atmosphere in work and which painfully affected them\".[11][12]\n\n## Timeline of the demonstration\n\n[edit]### First march\n\n[edit]The first march began in the district of La Cayolle in Marseille on 15 October 1983. Only seventeen persons started the march (nine from Les Minguettes) in a virtual indifference. During the march, more and more marchers joined them. Arriving in the city of Salon-de-Provence, one single person welcomed the marchers, but when arriving in Lyon and V\u00e9nissieux during the 15th day (2 October), a thousand people welcomed the group. At Grenoble on 31 October 1983 the permanent marchers\u2019 group totalled 32 persons. On the 36th day, in Strasbourg, they were joined for one day by the Secretary of State delegated to family, to population and immigrants workers issues. The movement was growing more and more. When finally arriving in Paris, the march had lasted exactly 50 days, permanent marchers having covered 1500 km. On 3 December 1983 the march ended with a demonstration in Paris, attended by more than 100,000 people. A delegation was received by the President of the French Republic Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Mitterrand promised a residence and working permit valid for 10 years, a law against racist crimes and a project concerning voting right for foreigners for local elections. This last point, which was already a proposition of Mitterrand's during the presidential election, never came true.\n\n### Following marches\n\n[edit]In 1984, a second march was organized by a group from the first march called Convergences 1984, whose spokesman was Farida Belghoul. The march was actively supported by the media, especially by the daily newspapers *Le Monde*, *Lib\u00e9ration* and *Le Matin*. The Socialist Party tried to hijack the movement via the anti-racist association SOS Racisme, created by the party. The third march was organized by SOS Racisme, on 28 July 1985, starting from Brussels. Toumi Dja\u00efdja complained of the hijacking, arguing that their movement was aimed to unite all the French regardless of their origins, whereas \"SOS Racisme divided the country in two fighting parts: anti-racists and racists\".\n\n## 2013 commemoration\n\n[edit]In 2013, in the city of V\u00e9nissieux, many events were organized to commemorate the march.\n\nOn 27 November 2013, a movie inspired by the march for equality and against racism titled *The Marchers* was released in cinemas. The film was directed by the Belgian Nabil Ben Yadir, and stars Oliver Gourmet in the role of the priest Christian Delorme, Tewfik Jallab in the role of Toumi Dja\u00efdja, and also Lubna Azabal, Jamel Debbouze, Charlotte Le Bon, Nader Boussandel, Philippe Nahon, Hafsia Herzi, Vincent Rottiers, M\u2019Barek Belkouk and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Souterelle.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- 1983 marchers who became members of the European Parliament: Djida Tazda\u00eft (1989-1994), Nora Za\u00efdi (1989-1994), Alima Boumediene-Thiery (1999-2004)\n- 1983 marchers who became French deputies or senators: Alima Boumediene-Thiery (senator, 2004-2011)\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\u00ab 8 pm TV News \u00bb,*Antenne 2*, 20 June 1983**^**\u00ab Minguettes: radioscopie d'un quartier \u00bb, 1 pm TV News,*Antenne 2*, 27 June 1983**^**\u00ab Visite du Pr\u00e9sident Mitterrand au \"Mont-Chauve\" (Montchovet) \u00e0 Saint-\u00c9tienne et aux Minguettes \u00bb, 8 pm TV News,*Antenne 2*, 10 August 1983**^**\u00ab Interview du P\u00e8re Christian Delorme \u00bb, 1 pm TV News,*Antenne 2*, 24 June 1983**^**Jamel Atallah (who was at the time treasurer of SOS Avenir Minguettes and took part to the 1983 March), \u00ab J'ai march\u00e9 pour l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en 1983: on \u00e9tait des stars, aujourd'hui la plupart sont au RSA \u00bb,*Le Plus Nouvel Obs*, 27 November 2013**^**Franck Chignier-Riboulon,*L'int\u00e9gration des franco-maghr\u00e9bins : L'exemple de l'est lyonnais*, \u00e9d.

The performance of the patients was compared with that of a control group consisting of eight subjects with no history of neurological deficits.\n\n**\nResults:\n**\nPatients with neglect as well as patients clinically recovered from neglect showed aberrant search performance in the virtual reality (VR) task, such as mixed search pattern, repeated target pressures and deviating hand movements. The results indicate that in patients with a right hemispheric stroke, this VR application can provide an additional tool for assessment that can identify small variations otherwise not detectable with standard paper-and-pencil tests.\n\n**\nConclusion:\n**\nVR technology seems to be well suited for the assessment of visually guided manual exploration in space.\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Full Text Sources\n\n### Other Literature Sources\n\n### Medical\n\n# Content from https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1600-0404.2007.00821.x\nError fetching https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1600-0404.2007.00821.x: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1600-0404.2007.00821.x'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step 1 \u2014 Search: I searched for a 2007 Gothenburg study on virtual reality, neglect, search patterns and kinematics.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Locate: The search returned a PubMed record (PMID 17714328) and the Wiley journal listing.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Verify: Opening the PubMed entry shows the 2007 paper title and abstract describing a VR cancellation task used to examine search patterns and hand-movement kinematics in right-hemisphere stroke patients.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{Neglect assessment as an application of virtual reality}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":11369.3771362305,"scoring_ms":394.8178291321,"total_ms":11764.1949653625,"info":{"raw_question":"Identify the title of a 2007 paper published in a Scandinavian neurology journal.

The Prekmurje Slovenes speak the Prekmurje Slovene dialect and have a common culture.[1][ unreliable source?] The Hungarian Slovenes\n\n*(Porabski Slovenci)*and Somogy Slovenes also speak the Prekmurje Slovene dialect.\n\n[2]\n\n## Origins\n\n[edit]The Prekmurje Slovenes are descendants of the Slovenes of Lower Pannonia (Slovene *Spodnja Panonija*, Prekmurje dialect *Spoudnja Panonija*, Hungarian: *Als\u00f3-Pann\u00f3nia*), who were vassals of the Frankish Empire in the 9th century. The Magyars conquered Lower Pannonia in 900, and many of the Slovenes were assimilated. However, the Prekmurje Slovenes in the vicinity of the Mura River maintained their identity.\n\n## Middle Ages\n\n[edit]The dialect spoken by the Prekmurje Slovenes, in the absence of contacts with other Slovenes, began to diverge from the standard Slovene (Carniolan) dialect. Nevertheless, contacts were maintained with other Slovene areas such as Lower Styria, Maribor, and Ljutomer. In the Middle Ages the Bishopric of Gy\u0151r applied the name \"T\u00f3ts\u00e1g\" to the Slovene parishes in Vas County, and this name was later also applied to the Slovene areas in Zala County. At that time, ethnic Slovene territory extended to Burgenland and \u0150rs\u00e9g. In the 12th to 13th centuries, a Slovene community lived near Szentgotth\u00e1rd Abbey.[3]\n\n## From the Protestant Reformation to the 19th century\n\n[edit]In the 16th century Protestantism spread among the Hungarian Slovenes. The Protestant Slovenes were the first to publish in their mother tongue. In the 18th century they already had their own identity, referred to as *(Vogrszki szlovenszki)* 'Hungarian Slovenes' by Istv\u00e1n K\u00fczmics in the *Predgovor* (Foreword) of *Nouvi Z\u00e1kon*. The Catholic translator and writer Mikl\u00f3s K\u00fczmics also demonstrated that the Slavic people of Carniola, Styria, T\u00f3ts\u00e1g and Somogy are Slovenes too, but Hungarian Slovenes with their own language:[4] *Who will disallow those Slovenes who live between the Mura and the Raba the right to translate these holy books into the language, in which they understand God talking to them through prophets and apostles' letters? God tells them too to read these books in order to get prepared for salvation in the faith of Jesus Christ. But they cannot receive this from Trubar's, Dalmatin's, Francel's, or other translations (versio). The language of our Hungarian Slovenes is different from other languages and unique in its own characteristics. Already in the aforementioned translations there are differences. Therefore, a man had to come who would translate the Bible and bring praise for God and salvation for his nation. God encouraged Istv\u00e1n K\u00fczmics for this work, a priest from Surd, who translated \u2013 with the help of the Holy Spirit and with great diligence \u2013 the whole New Testament from Greek into the language you are reading and hearing. With the help (and expenses) of many religious souls, the Holy Bible was printed and given to you for the same reason K\u00fczmics prepared V\u00f6re Krszts\u00e1nszke kr\u00e1tki n\u00e1vuk, which was printed in 1754.*[5]\n\nIn the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries some of the Mura Slovenes moved to Somogy county.\n\n## 19th century and Magyarization\n\n[edit]In the 19th century part of the policy of Magyarization was to raise the national identity-consciousness of the Prekmurje Slovenes, but by means of the *Non-Slovene theory* (the Wendish question). The theory, which was supported by Hungarians, was that the Wends (Prekmurje Slovenes) are a \"Slavic-Magyar people\", and in the long run the support for the Prekmurje dialect and culture is unnecessary as these \"Slavic-Magyars\" would become entirely Magyarized.\n\n## 1918\u20131991\n\n[edit]By the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, two-thirds of the Slovene population of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Catholic Slovene politicians from Prekmurje, such as J\u00f3zsef Klekl, welcomed the Treaty. Later Klekl became disappointed with the lack of democracy in the new state, the constraints on the use of Slovene, and the failure to implement land reform. As a result, he became an advocate for the Slovene language and Slovene national identity.[6] An opposite position was taken by another Prekmurje politician, Mi\u0161ko Kranjec, who later became a member of Slovene Communist Party.\n\nAfter 1945 the Yugoslav government tried to suppress J\u00f3zsef Klekl's ideas. In Hungary too not only the Prekmurje Slovene identity was suppressed, but Slovene national identity in general.\n\n### The theories of S\u00e1ndor Mikola\n\n[edit]After World War I the \"Wendish-Celtic\" and \"Wendish-Magyar\" theories were elaborated by S\u00e1ndor Mikola. These were based on a falsification of the history of Prekmurje. Slovene sources have said that Mikola claimed that the Prekmurje Slovenes (Wends) are a separate nation, but in fact Mikola denied that there is such a thing as a Prekmurje Slovene identity. In his opinion the Prekmurje Slovenes are a Hungarian group and they \"will become Hungarians.\"\n\n### The Mura Republic and Slovenska krajina\n\n[edit]In 1918 Klekl sought to establish an autonomous territory, the \"Slovenska krajina\" (or Slovene March) within Hungary.[7] However, there was little support in Ljubljana for this idea and he later proposed that the Slovene March become an independent state, confederated with Yugoslavia. Later Klekl regretted, that the idea of the Slovene krajina was not pursued. On 29 May 1919 Vilmos Tk\u00e1lecz declared the Mura Republic *(Murska republika, Respublika M\u00fcrska)*in Murska Sobota, but this had little impact as well.\n\n## Since 1991\n\n[edit]After 1991 the writer Feri Lain\u0161\u010dek[8][9] and others[10] championed the concept of a Prekmurje Slovene identity[11] (*panonskoslovenska identiteta*).[12] Another advocate of a Prekmurje Slovene identity, Evald Flisar, has written: *The homeland regards Prekmurje not as a part of Slovenia but something peculiar within its borders\u2026 It is unthinkable for two people from Prekmurje to speak with each other in anything but the Prekmurje dialect. I used to meet the former President of the Republic Milan Ku\u010dan at public events quite often. We always spoke the local dialect, it would have felt odd to use standard Slovenian, since he is from Prekmurje too. Others joked about us, asking why are we so secretive. When I met a compatriot in Australia, Africa or America, we immediately started to talk in our own language. This is our language.*[13]\n\n## Notable people of Prekmurje Slovenes\n\n[edit]-\nJ\u00f3zsef Borovny\u00e1k, politician and writer\n-\nImre Agustich, journalist\n-\nFerenc Ivan\u00f3czy, politician\n-\n\u00c1goston P\u00e1vel, linguist and scientist\n-\nJ\u00f3zsef Klekl, politician\n-\nJ\u00f3zsef Szakovics, writer\n-\nVilko Novak, historian and scientist\n-\nLudvik Vre\u010di\u010d, painter\n-\nMi\u0161ko Kranjec, writer\n-\nFerdo Godina, writer\n-\nAnton Vratu\u0161a, politician and scientist\n-\nMiki Muster, sculptor, illustrator, cartoonist\n-\nMilan Ku\u010dan, first president of Republic of Slovenia\n-\nVlado Kreslin, singer-songwriter and musician\n-\nEvald Flisar, writer\n-\nKeith Jarrett, jazz pianist and composer\n-\nFeri Lain\u0161\u010dek, writer and poet\n-\nNika Zorjan, singer\n-\nSuzana Tratnik, writer and lesbian activist\n\n## Literature\n\n[edit]- Jo\u017ee Alojz and Janez Sraka:\n*Prekmurci in Prekmurje*, Chicago 1984. - Franci Just:\n*Med verzu\u0161ko in pesmijo*, Poezija Prekmurja v prvi polovici 20. stoletja, Franc-Franc, Murska Sobota 2000.

It is used in private communication, liturgy and publications by authors from Prekmurje[4][5] as well as in television, radio and newspapers.[6][7][8][9] It is closely related to other Slovene dialects in neighboring Slovene Styria as well as to Kajkavian with which it is mutually intelligible to a considerable degree, and forms a dialect continuum with other South Slavic languages.\n\nPrekmurje Slovene is part of the Pannonian dialect group (Slovene: *panonska nare\u010dna skupina*), which is also known as the eastern Slovene dialect group (*vzhodnoslovenska nare\u010dna skupina*). Prekmurje Slovene shares many common features with the dialects of Haloze, Slovenske Gorice, and Prlekija, with which it is completely mutually intelligible. It is also closely related to the Kajkavian dialects of Croatian, although mutual comprehension is difficult.[ clarification needed] Prekmurje Slovene, especially its more traditional version spoken by the Hungarian Slovenes, is not readily understood by speakers from central and western Slovenia, whereas speakers from eastern Slovenia (Lower Styria) have much less difficulty understanding it. The early 20th-century philologist \u00c1goston P\u00e1vel stated that Prekmurje Slovene is actually a major, independent dialect of Slovene, from which it differs mostly in the aspects of stress, intonation, the softening of consonants and\u2014as a result of the lack of linguistic reform\u2014in the striking dearth of modern vocabulary\n\n[10]and that it has preserved many older features from Proto-Slavic.\n\n## Geographical distribution\n\n[edit]Prekmurje Slovene is spoken by approximately 110,000 speakers worldwide.[1] of which 80,000 in Prekmurje, 20,000 throughout in Slovenia (especially in Maribor and Ljubljana) and 10,000 in other countries. In Hungary, it is used by the Slovene-speaking minority in the Vas County in and around the town of Szentgotth\u00e1rd. Other speakers of the dialect live in other Hungarian towns, particularly Budapest, Szombathely, Bakony, and Mosonmagyar\u00f3v\u00e1r. The dialect was also spoken in Somogy (especially in the village of Tarany), but it has nearly disappeared in the last two centuries. There are some speakers in Austria, Germany, the United States, and Argentina.\n\n## Status\n\n[edit]Prekmurje Slovene has a defined territory and body of literature, and it is one of the few Slovene dialects in Slovenia that are still spoken by all strata of the local population.[11] Some speakers have claimed that it is a separate language. Prominent writers in Prekmurje Slovene, such as Mikl\u00f3s K\u00fczmics,[11] Istv\u00e1n K\u00fczmics, \u00c1goston P\u00e1vel, J\u00f3zsef Klekl Senior,[12] and J\u00f3zsef Szakovics, have claimed that it is a language, not simply a dialect. Evald Flisar, a writer, poet, and playwright from Prekmurje (Gori\u010dko), states that people from Prekmurje \"talk in our own language\".[11] It also has a written standard and literary tradition, both of which were largely neglected after World War II. There were attempts to publish in it more broadely in the 1990s, primarily in Hungary,[13] and there has been a revival of literature in Prekmurje Slovene since the late 1990s.\n\nOthers consider Prekmurje Slovene a regional language, without denying that it is part of Slovene.[14][15][16][17][18] The linguist Janko Dular has characterized Prekmurje Slovene as a \"local standard language\" for historical reasons,[19] followed by the Prekmurje writer Feri Lain\u0161\u010dek. However, Prekmurje Slovene is not recognized as a language in Slovenia or Hungary, nor does it enjoy any legal protection under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. In 2016, the General Maister Society (*Dru\u0161tvo General Maister*) proposed that primary schools offer education in the Prekmurje Slovene.[20][21] Some regional politicians and intellectuals advocate Prekmurje Slovene.[22]\n\nAlongside Resian, Prekmurje Slovene is the only Slovene dialect with a literary standard that has had a different historical development than the rest of the Slovene ethnic territory. For centuries, it has been used as a language of education as well as in the press and liturgy.[23] The historical Hungarian name for the Slovenes living within the borders of the Kingdom of Hungary (as well as for the Slovenes in general) was *Vendek*, or the Wends. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Prekmurje authors used to designate this language variety as *szt\u00e1ri szlovenszki jezik* 'old Slovene'. Both then and now, it is also referred to as the \"Slovene language between the Mura and Raba\" *(Sloven\u0161\u010dina med Muro in Rabo; Slovenski jezik med M\u00fcrov i R\u00e1bov)*.\n\nPrekmurje Slovene is widely used in the regional media (Murski Val Radio, Porabje, Slovenski utrinki), films,[24] literature. The youth write SMS messages and web comments in their local tongue. In Prekmurje and Hungary, several streets, shops, hotels, etc. bear Prekmurje Slovene names.[25][26] In the 2012 protests in Slovenia in Murska Sobota, the protesters used Prekmurje Slovene banners.[27] It is the liturgical language in the Lutheran and Pentecostal churches and in the Catholic Church of Hungarian Slovenes. Marko Jesen\u0161ek, a professor at the University of Maribor, has stated that the functionality of Prekmurje Slovene is limited, but \"it lives on in poetry and journalism.\"[28]\n\nScholars in modern linguistics, dialectology and other fields consistently use the term *prekmur\u0161\u010dina,* denoting it as a language.[ clarification needed]\n\n[29]\n\n[30]\n\n[31]The Slovene affix\n\n*-\u0161\u010dina*signifies a language (e.g.\n\n*nem\u0161\u010dina*'German'), dialect (e.g.,\n\n*celj\u0161\u010dina*'Celje dialect'), or manner of speaking (e.g.\n\n*latov\u0161\u010dina*'jargon').\n\n## Name\n\n[edit]In 1988, Slovene English-language specialist Stanko Klinar ascertained that it is grammatically correct to use the name *Prekmurian* (alongside forms like *Ljubljanian* and *Mariboran*).[32]\n\nThe name *Prekmurian* first appeared in a scientific publication in 1977.[33] Previous scientific texts in the 1990s and 2000s mostly used the terms *Prekmurje Slovene, Prekmurje language, Prekmurje dialect* etc. (e.g. Greenberg).[34] Nowadays, the most popular term in scientific texts is *Prekmurian*.[ dubious \u2013 discuss]\n\n[35]\n\n[36]\n\n[31]\n\n[37]\n\n## Dialects\n\n[edit]Prekmurje Slovene is used as:\n\n- The dialect of the hilly Gori\u010dko,\n[38]in northern Prekmurje, particularly in the villages of Grad, Gornji Petrovci, Kri\u017eevci, Kuzma, Kuzma, Roga\u0161ovci, \u0160alovci, and Ma\u010dkovci.- The Raba March (Porabje) subdialect in Hungary, a variety of the Gori\u010dko dialect.\n[39]\n\n- The Raba March (Porabje) subdialect in Hungary, a variety of the Gori\u010dko dialect.\n- THe dialect of the lowland Ravensko in Central Prekmurje,\n[38]particularly in the villages of Puconci, Cankova, Bogojina, Bakovci, Ti\u0161ina, Petanjci, Moravske Toplice, and Raki\u010dan.- The Murska Sobota subdialect, i.e. the speech of the town of Murska Sobota; it is a variety of the Ravensko dialect.\n\n- The Dolinsko subdialect in South Prekmurje,\n[38]particularly in the villages of Beltinci, Bratonci, \u010cren\u0161ovci, Velika Polana, Turni\u0161\u010de, \u017di\u017eki, Renkovci, Bistrica (Dolnja, Gornja and Srednja). It is also named the Marko (*markovsko*or*markasto*) dialect due to the prevalence of the personal name*Marko*(Mark) in the past.[38]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Early history\n\n[edit]The Prekmurje Slovene developed from the language of the Carantanian Slavs who settled around Balaton in the 9th century. Due to the political and geographical separation from other Slovene dialects (unlike most of the contemporary Slovenia, which was part of the Holy Roman Empire, Prekmurje was under the authority of the Kingdom of Hungary for almost a thousand years), the Prekmurje Slovene acquired many specific features. Separated from the cultural development of the remainder of ethnic Slovene territory, the Slovenes in Hungary gradually forged their own specific culture and also their own literary language.\n\nin the 16th and 17th centuries, a few Slovene Protestant pastors fled from Carniola and Styria to Hungary. They brought along the Bible of Jurij Dalmatin, which was used in Fels\u0151sz\u00f6ln\u00f6k. and Postil of Primo\u017e Trubar, which was used in Gornji Petrovci.[40][41][42] The Hungarian Slovenes found it difficult to understand the language of these books.\n\nBy the 16th century, a theory linking the Hungarian Slovenes to the ancient Vandals became popular.[43] Accordingly, Prekmurje Slovene was frequently designated in Hungarian Latin documents as the *Vandalian language* (Latin: *lingua vandalica*, Hungarian: *Vand\u00e1l nyelv*).\n\nFor a long time, the circumstances of the two-tier development of the Slovene language was ignored in Slovenian linguistics and science. The current form of the standard Slovene language only developed in the 19th century. Prior to this, the Slovene language norm was twofold: the Central Slovene language (mostly in Carniola) and the Eastern Slovene language (in Styria and Hungary).[44]\n\nFor a brief period, there were also two variants of the Eastern Slovene language: the Prekmurje Slovene and the Eastern Styrian Slovene (in the regions of Ormo\u017e, Ljutomer and Lenart of Slovene Hills).[45]\n\nThe literary traditions of the Prekmurje dialect developed during the Protestant Reformation: mostly manuscript hymnals with religious hymns, psalms from the 16th and 17th century,[46] and a contract from 1643.[47] The standard language emerged at the beginning of the 18th century and developed slowly.[48] The standard Prekmurje Slovene followed homogeneous grammatical rules and phonetic characteristics.[49][50] An example of this is the use of the wovels *\u00f6* or *\u00fc* and diphthongs in writing.\n\nManuscripts were also written in the Eastern Styrian Slovene language.[51] Printed books in this language were also published.[52] However, there were no homogeneous grammatical or phonologycal forms in this language variant. Styrian Slovene authors had thoroughly different ideas about the standard language.[53] The Styrian Slovene literary language eventually ceased to exist and was replaced by the Central Slovene language.[54]\n\n### 18th century\n\n[edit]The first book in the Prekmurje Slovene appeared in 1715 and was written by the Lutheran pastor Ferenc Temlin.[55] The most important authors from this period were the Lutheran pastor Istv\u00e1n K\u00fczmics[56] and the Roman Catholic priest Mikl\u00f3s K\u00fczmics[57] who set the standard for the Prekmurje regional standard language in the 18th century.\n\nIstv\u00e1n translated the entire New Testament into Prekmurje Slovene (Nouvi Z\u00e1kon 1771). Istv\u00e1n was born in Ravensko (lowland) and based his standard language on the Ravensko dialect of Prekmurje Slovene,[58] just like it was used in old regional manuscripts.[59] He also expanded the language with elements from the Gori\u010dko (highland) dialect.[60]\n\nWho will prevent those Slovenians who live between the Mura and the Raba the right to translate these holy books into the language that they understand God talking to them through prophets and epistles? God ordaines them to read these books to get prepared for the salvation in the faith of Jesus Christ. However, they cannot receive this from Trubar's, Dalmatin's, Francel's,\n\n[61]or other translations (versio). The language of our Hungarian Slovenes differs from other languages and has unique characteristics. There are differences already in the said translations.\n\n\u2014 Istv\u00e1n K\u00fczmics, J\u00f3zsef Torkos, Predgovor, Nouvi Z\u00e1kon (1771)[62]\n\nMikl\u00f3s K\u00fczmics was born in Gori\u010dko but he followed Istv\u00e1n's language scheme.[49] He adopted further elements from the Gori\u010dko and Dolinsko dialects. Mikl\u00f3s wrote several books, which were reprinted in the 20th century. His prayer book (*Kniga molitvena*, 1783) became very popular. His text and coursebook (*ABC Kni'sicza*, 1790) was used for decades in Slovene schools.[63]\n\nImportant standardization work in Prekmurje Lutheran literature was also performed by Istv\u00e1n Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3[64] and Mih\u00e1ly Bakos.[65]\n\n*Versus Vandalici*, the first literary poem in the Prekmurje dialect, was written in 1774.[66]\n\n### 19th century\n\n[edit]In 1823, Mih\u00e1ly Barla wrote a new set of rules for writing the Prekmurje Slovene. He introduced three new characters to denote diphthongs: *\u00f4* (ou), *\u00ea* (ej), and *\u00e2* (aj).[67] The new orthography was put forward in two new hymnals, *Diktomszke, versuske i molitvene kni'zicze* (1820) and *Krscsanszke n\u00f4ve peszmene knige* (1823). In 1820, a Lutheran teacher named Istv\u00e1n L\u00fclik wrote a new textbook *N\u00f4vi abeczed\u00e1r,* which was published three times (1853, 1856, 1863).[68] His book used Barla's orthography even though it was only used in the Prekmurje Lutheran literature.\n\nL\u00fclik wrote the first grammar of the Prekmurje dialect, but it was never printed.\n\nThe first secular book in the Prekmurje dialect was a ceremony book for weddings (*Sztarisinsztvo i zvacsinsztvo*. 1804; the author is probably Istv\u00e1n Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3).[69]\n\nThe Catholic priest J\u00f3zsef Kossics used the Prekmurje dialect in new functions. He didn't write religious books but books on history, grammar and etiquette. His stance was in line with the tendency for national encouragement.[70]\n\nThe Lutheran pastor S\u00e1ndor Terpl\u00e1n translated the Psalms (*Knige 'zolt\u00e1rszke*. 1848) and wrote new schoolbooks.\n\nJ\u00e1nos Kardos translated numerous poems of S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi, J\u00e1nos Arany and a few Hungarian poets. He drafted new schoolbooks, for ex. *N\u00f4ve knige csteny\u00e1 za veszn\u00edcski s\u00f4l dr\u00fcgi zl\u00f4cs.*[71] Kardos approached the language in a conservative manner: he was not open for Slovene or Croatian and stuck to archaic elements. K\u00e1rdos' purism was very similar to the purism of Fran Levstik in Carniola.[72]\n\nUnlike Kardos, J\u00f3zsef Borovny\u00e1k was a Catholic priest who adapted standard Prekmurje Slovene to the standard Slovene.[73] Borovny\u00e1k also contributed to the functional development of the Prekmurje dialect, e.g. with his political brochure *M\u00e1li politicsni vodnik* (1869).[74]\n\nIn 1875, the poet, writer, translator and journalist Imre Augustich established the first Prekmurje Slovene newspaper. *Prij\u00e1tel* (The Friend).[75] Then he wrote a new Hungarian\u2013Prekmurje Slovene grammar *(N\u00e1vuk vogrszkoga jezika*, 1876)[76] and translated works of Hungarian poets and writers.[77]\n\nAugustich approached the standard Slovene,[78][79] but at first he retained the Hungarian alphabet. Later he introduced the Gaj alphabet in the Prij\u00e1tel[80] and in a new coursebook *Prirodopis s kepami,* the first natural science book in the Prekmurje dialect.[81]\n\nIn 1871, J\u00f3zsef Bag\u00e1ry wrote the first schoolbook that used the Gaj alphabet (*Perve knige \u2013 \u010dteny\u00e1 za katholi\u010d\u00e1nske vesni\u010dke \u0161ol\u00ea*).[82] The Magyarization policy tried to exclude it from school usage but it enjoyed such a popularity in schools that it was reprinted in 1886.[83]\n\nIn the last decades of the 19th and 20th centuries, the terms \"Wends\" and \"Wendish language\" were promoted mostly by pro-Hungarians to emphasize the difference between the Hungarian Slovenes and other Slovenes, attempting to create a separate ethnic identity for them.\n\nThe Prekmurje Slovene language kept up with the changes of the modern era and was able to reinvent itself[84] on its own or by adopting innovations from the (Central) Slovene and Croatian languages. The assertion that the Prekmurje Slovene slowly declined with modernization in the mid-19th century is not credible. It is contradicted by the first science books (by Kossics[85] and Augustich[81]) and the first news publications.[86][87]\n\n### 20th century\n\n[edit]In 1908, Albert Apponyi, the Hungarian minister of education and religion, implemented a new act that demanded the school subjects to be taught in Hungarian language in all schools of the Kingdom of Hungary. The purpose of the act was to magyarize national minorities. School education in Prekmurje Slovene ceased.[88]\n\nIn 1914\u20131918, J\u00f3zsef Klekl, a politician and later a congressman in Belgrade, reformed the Prekmurje Slovene literary language[78] by using elements of the Croatian and Slovene languages.[89] In 1923, a new prayerbook titled *Hodi k oltarskomi svesti* (Come on to the Eucharist) was written in the Gaj alphabet.\n\nIn 1919, the majority of Prekmurje became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Slovene and Serbo-Croatian replaced Hungarian as the languages of education and administration. Prekmurje Slovene remained the language of literature, journalism and church service.\n\nEven though education in Prekmurje Slovene did not resume in Yugoslavia (the teaching languages were Serbo-Croatian and standard Slovene), Prekmurje Slovene flourished as a language of news in the 1920s and 1930s. It was used to write articles in the periodicals *Novine, Marijin list, Marijin ogra\u010dek,* the calendar *Kalendar Srca Jezu\u0161ovoga,* the Lutheran *D\u00fc\u0161evni list* and *Evangeli\u010danski kalendari*.[90] Slovene emigrants from Prekmurje also had their own weekly in the United States between 1921 and 1954 written in the Prekmurje Slovene: *Amerikanszki Szlovencov Gl\u00e1sz (American Windish Voice).*[91]\n\nJ\u00f3zsef Szakovics was actively involved in cultivating the Prekmurje Slovene with his books and articles in newspapers and calendars and with reprints of the oldest book of Mikl\u00f3s K\u00fczmics. The prominent Prekmurje writer Mi\u0161ko Kranjec also wrote in Prekmurje Slovene.\n\nIn this period, several works of the world literature were also translated into the Prekmurje dialect, e.g. Moli\u00e8re's *Le M\u00e9decin malgr\u00e9 lui*.[92][93]\n\nJ\u00e1nos Berke started to collect the vocabulary for the first Prekmurje dialect dictionary,[94] which was then published in part by J\u00e1nos Flisz\u00e1r under the title *Vogrszki-vendiski r\u00eacsnik* in 1922. The entire dictionary with fifty thousand terms has been preserved in manuscript.[95]\n\nIn 1941, the Hungarian Army occupied the area of Prekmurje, and it aimed to eradicate Prekmurje Slovene and standard Slovene by 1945, assisted by the Slovene irredentist Mikola.[96]\n\nAfter 1945, the Communist Yugoslavia banned the printing of books and newspapers in the Prekmurje Slovene, and only standard Slovene and Serbo-Croatian were used in administration and education.[97] In Hungary, the dictator M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi banned every minority language and deported the Slovenes to the Hungarian Plain.[98]\n\nThere has been a significant uptick of interest in the Prekmurje dialect and cultural heritage since Slovenia became independent. Several associations, publishers, and self-published prints of both old and new books have appeared in the Prekmurje dialect.\n\n### 21st century\n\n[edit]In the 21st century, the Prekmurje dialect has become more visible in Slovenian cultural life. It can be more frequently heard in different interviews on TV channels and radios (Murski val,[99] Slovenski utrinki[100]). Today, the Prekmurje dialect is also written on public signs, such as some shop signs, which attests to its growing use in the region.\n\nIn 2018, a transla\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_aMecGjhHDMye6PS9fAR9jqcF\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"http:\/\/www.sabor.hr\/en\/mps\/national-minorities-mps\\\",\\\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minorities_in_Croatia\\\",\\\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prekmurje_Slovenes\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Content from http:\/\/www.sabor.hr\/en\/mps\/national-minorities-mps\nError rendering http:\/\/www.sabor.hr\/en\/mps\/national-minorities-mps: Cannot connect to host www.sabor.hr:443 ssl:True [SSLCertVerificationError: (1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1010)')]\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minorities_in_Croatia\nError fetching https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minorities_in_Croatia: 404, message='Not Found', url='https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minorities_in_Croatia'\n\n# Content from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prekmurje_Slovenes\n# Prekmurje Slovenes\n\nThis article has multiple issues.

The Prekmurje Slovenes speak the Prekmurje Slovene dialect and have a common culture.[1][ unreliable source?] The Hungarian Slovenes\n\n*(Porabski Slovenci)*and Somogy Slovenes also speak the Prekmurje Slovene dialect.\n\n[2]\n\n## Origins\n\n[edit]The Prekmurje Slovenes are descendants of the Slovenes of Lower Pannonia (Slovene *Spodnja Panonija*, Prekmurje dialect *Spoudnja Panonija*, Hungarian: *Als\u00f3-Pann\u00f3nia*), who were vassals of the Frankish Empire in the 9th century. The Magyars conquered Lower Pannonia in 900, and many of the Slovenes were assimilated. However, the Prekmurje Slovenes in the vicinity of the Mura River maintained their identity.\n\n## Middle Ages\n\n[edit]The dialect spoken by the Prekmurje Slovenes, in the absence of contacts with other Slovenes, began to diverge from the standard Slovene (Carniolan) dialect. Nevertheless, contacts were maintained with other Slovene areas such as Lower Styria, Maribor, and Ljutomer. In the Middle Ages the Bishopric of Gy\u0151r applied the name \"T\u00f3ts\u00e1g\" to the Slovene parishes in Vas County, and this name was later also applied to the Slovene areas in Zala County. At that time, ethnic Slovene territory extended to Burgenland and \u0150rs\u00e9g. In the 12th to 13th centuries, a Slovene community lived near Szentgotth\u00e1rd Abbey.[3]\n\n## From the Protestant Reformation to the 19th century\n\n[edit]In the 16th century Protestantism spread among the Hungarian Slovenes. The Protestant Slovenes were the first to publish in their mother tongue. In the 18th century they already had their own identity, referred to as *(Vogrszki szlovenszki)* 'Hungarian Slovenes' by Istv\u00e1n K\u00fczmics in the *Predgovor* (Foreword) of *Nouvi Z\u00e1kon*. The Catholic translator and writer Mikl\u00f3s K\u00fczmics also demonstrated that the Slavic people of Carniola, Styria, T\u00f3ts\u00e1g and Somogy are Slovenes too, but Hungarian Slovenes with their own language:[4] *Who will disallow those Slovenes who live between the Mura and the Raba the right to translate these holy books into the language, in which they understand God talking to them through prophets and apostles' letters? God tells them too to read these books in order to get prepared for salvation in the faith of Jesus Christ. But they cannot receive this from Trubar's, Dalmatin's, Francel's, or other translations (versio). The language of our Hungarian Slovenes is different from other languages and unique in its own characteristics. Already in the aforementioned translations there are differences. Therefore, a man had to come who would translate the Bible and bring praise for God and salvation for his nation. God encouraged Istv\u00e1n K\u00fczmics for this work, a priest from Surd, who translated \u2013 with the help of the Holy Spirit and with great diligence \u2013 the whole New Testament from Greek into the language you are reading and hearing. With the help (and expenses) of many religious souls, the Holy Bible was printed and given to you for the same reason K\u00fczmics prepared V\u00f6re Krszts\u00e1nszke kr\u00e1tki n\u00e1vuk, which was printed in 1754.*[5]\n\nIn the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries some of the Mura Slovenes moved to Somogy county.\n\n## 19th century and Magyarization\n\n[edit]In the 19th century part of the policy of Magyarization was to raise the national identity-consciousness of the Prekmurje Slovenes, but by means of the *Non-Slovene theory* (the Wendish question). The theory, which was supported by Hungarians, was that the Wends (Prekmurje Slovenes) are a \"Slavic-Magyar people\", and in the long run the support for the Prekmurje dialect and culture is unnecessary as these \"Slavic-Magyars\" would become entirely Magyarized.\n\n## 1918\u20131991\n\n[edit]By the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, two-thirds of the Slovene population of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Catholic Slovene politicians from Prekmurje, such as J\u00f3zsef Klekl, welcomed the Treaty. Later Klekl became disappointed with the lack of democracy in the new state, the constraints on the use of Slovene, and the failure to implement land reform. As a result, he became an advocate for the Slovene language and Slovene national identity.[6] An opposite position was taken by another Prekmurje politician, Mi\u0161ko Kranjec, who later became a member of Slovene Communist Party.\n\nAfter 1945 the Yugoslav government tried to suppress J\u00f3zsef Klekl's ideas. In Hungary too not only the Prekmurje Slovene identity was suppressed, but Slovene national identity in general.\n\n### The theories of S\u00e1ndor Mikola\n\n[edit]After World War I the \"Wendish-Celtic\" and \"Wendish-Magyar\" theories were elaborated by S\u00e1ndor Mikola. These were based on a falsification of the history of Prekmurje. Slovene sources have said that Mikola claimed that the Prekmurje Slovenes (Wends) are a separate nation, but in fact Mikola denied that there is such a thing as a Prekmurje Slovene identity. In his opinion the Prekmurje Slovenes are a Hungarian group and they \"will become Hungarians.\"\n\n### The Mura Republic and Slovenska krajina\n\n[edit]In 1918 Klekl sought to establish an autonomous territory, the \"Slovenska krajina\" (or Slovene March) within Hungary.[7] However, there was little support in Ljubljana for this idea and he later proposed that the Slovene March become an independent state, confederated with Yugoslavia. Later Klekl regretted, that the idea of the Slovene krajina was not pursued. On 29 May 1919 Vilmos Tk\u00e1lecz declared the Mura Republic *(Murska republika, Respublika M\u00fcrska)*in Murska Sobota, but this had little impact as well.\n\n## Since 1991\n\n[edit]After 1991 the writer Feri Lain\u0161\u010dek[8][9] and others[10] championed the concept of a Prekmurje Slovene identity[11] (*panonskoslovenska identiteta*).[12] Another advocate of a Prekmurje Slovene identity, Evald Flisar, has written: *The homeland regards Prekmurje not as a part of Slovenia but something peculiar within its borders\u2026 It is unthinkable for two people from Prekmurje to speak with each other in anything but the Prekmurje dialect. I used to meet the former President of the Republic Milan Ku\u010dan at public events quite often. We always spoke the local dialect, it would have felt odd to use standard Slovenian, since he is from Prekmurje too. Others joked about us, asking why are we so secretive.

The present work has been developed in the context of the German Medical Informatics Initiative, where 29 university hospitals agreed to the usage of the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for their newly established data integration centers. This standard is optimized to describe and exchange medical data but less suitable for standard statistical analysis which mostly requires tabular data formats.\n\n**Objectives**\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analysis by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should be implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts and offer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n**Methods**\nWe propose the fhircrackr framework, which allows downloading and flattening FHIR resources for data analysis. The framework supports different download and authentication protocols and gives the user full control over the data that is extracted from the FHIR resources and transformed into tables. We implemented it using the programming language R [1] and published it under the GPL-3 open source license.\n\n**Results**\nThe framework was successfully applied to both publicly available test data and real-world data from several ongoing studies. While the processing of larger real-world data sets puts a considerable burden on computation time and memory consumption, those challenges can be attenuated with a number of suitable measures like parallelization and temporary storage mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe fhircrackr R package provides an open source solution within an environment that is familiar to most data scientists and helps overcome the practical challenges that still hamper the usage of EHR data for research.\n\n**Keywords:** Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, electronic health records, health information interoperability, data analysis\n\n## Background and Significance\n\n### Background\n\nThe digitalization of the health sector produces a growing interest in the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for clinical research. With the rise of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the need to share large-scale, near real-time patient data has shifted into focus 1 2 3 and there has been increasing activity in building new infrastructures 4 5 for data integration and data sharing.\n\nIn the context of this growing activity, the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard 6 has developed into one of the most popular interoperability standards worldwide. From the creation of FHIR profiles 7 to the mapping 8 and usage of the FHIR standard for data sharing, data visualization, and data quality assessment, 9 10 11 12 13 a vast number of projects using FHIR continues to grow all over the world.\n\nFollowing this trend, the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) 14 established 29 data integration centers in university hospitals across four consortia to integrate EHR data using FHIR. The FHIR standard focuses on the exchange of health care data and defines around 160 so-called resource types, each of which stands for a distinct entity of information that can be transferred using standard web technologies. 15 While FHIR is well-established as a standard in clinical data exchange, for example, for medical applications, Duda et al 16 have found that it is less commonly used in clinical research. Since FHIR is optimized to describe and transfer medical data of individual patients, it is less tailored to statistical analysis of patient cohorts and other applications requiring tabular data. FHIR resources are represented as interlinked JSON or XML objects instead of the matrix-like structures and cannot be handled by most statistical software. The proposed framework is based on the XML representation of FHIR, which is also used throughout this article.\n\nWe developed a framework for extracting and reshaping data from FHIR resources using the well-established XPath expression language, 17 which allows analysts to create tables from FHIR data that can be processed by any standard statistical or other software that expects tabular data. The framework is implemented in the open-source R package 18 fhircrackr 19 and can be downloaded from the comprehensive R archive network. 20\n\nIn the remainder of this article, we will introduce the basics of the FHIR standard followed by a conceptual description of how the fhircrackr framework builds on this standard. Then, we will illustrate the framework with a reproducible example using open access test data and conclude with a discussion of the framework in light of currently ongoing studies, which use real-world EHR data for statistical analyses in several areas of biomedical research.\n\n### FHIR Basics\n\nThe FHIR standard is used to describe data originating from clinical routine documentation. In this standard, all data elements are represented as so-called FHIR resources. A single FHIR resource holds a specific piece of information like a laboratory measurement, demographic information on a patient, or the description of a medical procedure. A full list of currently defined FHIR resources can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/resourcelist.html*\n. Two simplified examples are shown in\nFig. 1\n, where information on a patient and a measurement of her body temperature are represented in the form of a Patient resource and an Observation resource, respectively.\n\nIdeally, every FHIR resource holds the machine-readable information that is needed to interpret the data including its provenance, the actual data point (e.g., the body temperature measured), the metadata (e.g., the unit and date), and references to other resources the data relates to (e.g., the patient the temperature is taken from). The nested structure of the resource is needed because EHR data, like other kinds of data that is exchanged in discrete units, has an inherently nested structure. In the FHIR R4, the most recent version of the standard, there are around 160 resource types, each of them devoted to a specific kind of medical information. In theory, each FHIR resource is individually retrievable from the server, but for statistical analysis, they are mostly downloaded in bundles. A FHIR bundle is a collection of multiple resources that can be exchanged and processed as a single entity. The FHIR standard is a RESTful specification, which uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication. To download data from the server, the standard describes the so-called FHIR Search paradigm, in which the user specifies the scope of the downloaded data with suitable search parameters and downloads the respective resources using HTTP GET or POST. The details of this paradigm are beyond the scope of this article, however, extensive documentation can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/search.html*\n.\n\nThe structure of the FHIR standard stands in contrast to data formats that are usually employed in data analysis. Most statistical software expects a matrix-like structure, where columns represent features and rows represent observations on the set of features formed by those columns. A single body temperature measurement, for example, could be one cell in a matrix that has patients in rows and measurements of vital signs in columns. In contrast, the FHIR representation of this single cell would be an entire json\/xml object that contains not only the measured temperature value but also references to the patient it is taken from and other metadata. Information that is contained in a single table in a classical data analysis setting is expressed in a large number of interlinked resources when the data is represented in FHIR. Developing a framework bridging the gap between those two representations is the primary goal of this work.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analyses by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should have the following characteristics:\n\nBuild on the communication interface defined by HL7 FHIR.\n\nSupport common authentication protocols used for sensitive data.\n\nBe implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts.\n\nOffer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n\n## Methods\n\nTwo steps are necessary to make FHIR data available for analysis: (1) download the data from the server and (2) transform the data into a table format. To perform those tasks, the fhircrackr framework defines a set of classes and related functions, an overview over which can be found in Fig. 2 . Below, we will describe the necessary steps sequentially.\n\n### Downloading FHIR Data\n\nTo access FHIR data, the fhircrackr framework builds on the FHIR Search paradigm defined by HL7. The framework provides functionalities for the construction of FHIR search expressions via the function\n*fhir_url()*\nand uses the function\n*fhir_search()*\nto download the bundles.\n*fhir_search()*\nallows for basic authentication and Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0\n21\n) as well as automatic paging (sequential download of search result bundles) when the result is distributed over several bundles. Downloads can be done via GET or POST, depending on the use case, and can easily be parallelized when necessary. See\nFig. 3\nfor a representation of the downloading workflow. The downloading functions build on well-established functions from the httr-Package,\n22\nbut extend them by providing mechanisms for automatic paging as well as helper functions for building valid FHIR search requests and handling of common errors. The result of the downloading process is a list of FHIR bundles, which is represented as an S4 class\n23\ncalled\n*fhir_bundle_list*\n. Within this list, a single bundle is an object of class\n*fhir_bundle_xml*\n, an S4 class extending\n*xml_document*\nfrom the xml2 R package.\n24\nThe FHIR bundles can be transformed into tables (referred to as \u201cflattening\u201d) as described in the next section.\n\n### Flattening FHIR Data\n\n#### Resource Types\n\nDepending on the type of search request, a FHIR bundle can contain more than one resource type. When the resources are flattened, the fhircrackr framework constructs one table for each resource type, as shown in Fig. 4 . This is necessary because the variability between resources of different types is larger than the variability between resources of the same type. Putting the data of all resource types in a single table would thus create unreasonably large and sparsely populated tables.\n\n#### Elements to Extract\n\nThere are two modes of flattening the resources, depicted in\nFig. 5\n. Either (1) the entire structure is flattened, that is, every element that occurs in at least one of the resources will be turned into a column of the resulting table, or (2) a predefined subset of the elements is extracted from the resources. The former approach requires little knowledge about the individual structure of the resources but can result in very wide and sparse tables. The latter approach, in contrast, requires some knowledge about the structure of the resources, but will result in more concise and densely populated tables.\nFig. 6\nprovides an overview over the workflow of the flattening process: All information needed to flatten the resources is represented in the class\n*fhir_table_description*\n, which contains the type of resource to target (an object of class\n*fhir_resource_type*\n) and a list of XPath 1.0\n17\nexpressions (an object of class\n*fhir_columns*\n) specifying which elements of the resource to extract into the columns of the resulting table. The function\n*fhir_crack()*\nruns the extraction on all resources in the bundles, with one row being created per resource. If a specified element is not present in one of the resources, the corresponding cell in the resulting table is left empty.\n\nThe generic extraction process based on a user-specified XPath scheme ensures that the framework does not depend on any predefined resource structure, apart from it being valid xml. This has the advantage of making the tool compatible with both standard FHIR resources as well as arbitrary extensions to those resources and makes sure that the tool works on all versions of the FHIR standard, like the past STU3, current R4, and future R5 version.\n\n#### Repeating Elements\n\nTo represent complex EHR data adequately, FHIR resources can contain repeating elements, that is, elements with a cardinality greater than one. The FHIR core specification of the Patient resource, 25 for example, defines a 0* cardinality for the element \u201cPatient.address,\u201d meaning that a single Patient resource can contain zero, one, or multiple address elements. Creating a new column for each instance of the element would greatly inflate the resulting table, as a single resource with 10 address elements would result in 10 address columns. This effect worsens as the number of elements with multiple instances increases. To counteract this issue, the fhircrackr default puts values of repeating elements in the same column, separated by a string that can be defined in the table description, as depicted in Fig. 7 . To be able to tell apart which value belongs to which parent element, the fhircrackr can assign an index to each entry, which is surrounded by prespecified brackets. Together with the XPath or header of the column, the indices allow a reconstruction of the original FHIR structure, including the precise position of every element. We are aware that this default behavior violates the first normal form of database normalization, 26 which states that there should be no columns with sets of values. In consultation with various statisticians, we have however adopted the presented solution, since searching such complex fields in the cases considered here is easier to handle in common statistical packages than distributing the values over several columns or tables.\n\nTo resolve columns with sets of values, the fhircrackr framework provides functionalities to automatically split those values, either into a wide format with multiple columns (called casting), or into a long format with multiple rows (called melting). Fig. 8 illustrates the two approaches: In a cast table, the names of each column reflect the original position of the element and each row represents one resource. In a molten table, the number of columns stays the same and multiple entries are spread over several rows. As opposed to casting, melting is done with respect to a specific element (the address element in this example) and values from all other elements (e.g., the id element) are copied into the newly created rows. Fig. 9 represents the workflow of casting or melting a table with multiple entries.\n\nThe steps described so far only aim at making the data available in tabular form. In addition, common techniques of data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization should precede any statistical analysis, which however is beyond the scope of this article. A good summary of those methods specifically for EHR data is given by Yu et al. 27\n\n#### Recreating Resources\n\nApart from turning FHIR resources into flat tables, the fhircrackr framework also allows data to flow in the opposite direction, creating FHIR resources from flat tables. Because the framework is able to remember the original structure of the resources through column headers and indexing of entries, it is possible to recreate the original resources from the flattened tables. This allows the user to selectively remove or add single elements as well as running more complex computations to augment the original FHIR resources before sending them back to a server.\n\n### R Package fhircrackr\n\nWe implemented the above functionalities in a package called fhircrackr using the programming language R\n1\nand published it under the GPL-3 open source license on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (see \u201cSoftware Availability\u201d below). The package requires R Version 4.1.0 or higher and can be run on any operating system that can run R. While the package does not have specific hardware requirements and can be operated on a standard office notebook, the actual requirements regarding RAM and CPU strongly depend on the use case and the scope of the data being processed.\n\n## Results\n\n### Application to Test Data\n\nTo illustrate the basic functionalities of the package, we have set up a simple project on publicly available test data\n28\nat\n*https:\/\/github.com\/POLAR-fhiR\/fhircrackr_examples*\n. In this project, we investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and hypertensive disease (ICD-10 Code I10 - I15) diagnosed as a comorbidity in a small patient cohort. To achieve this, we need to (1) compute the BMI for each patient from downloaded Observation resources containing body weight and body height measurements and (2) relate it to the diagnosis information given in the Encounter and Condition resources of those patients. First, the code example shows how the function\n*fhir_url()*\nis used to build the appropriate FHIR search request which is then sent to the server using\n*fhir_search()*\n. The resulting list of FHIR bundles contains Patient and Observation resources. To flatten those resources into tables, two table descriptions are defined as shown in\nFig. 10\n.\n\nThe function\n*fhir_crack()*\nis then used to create the two tables and after some data preprocessing, the BMI is computed and a list of patient IDs is used to download the associated Encounter and Condition resources. According to the MII implementation guide,\n29\nwhich profiles an Encounter in the German health care system that is used in the test data, the diagnoses of a Patient are referenced in the Encounter resource and there can be multiple diagnoses listed in one encounter, as shown in\nFig. 11\n. The table created from those Encounters will therefore contain multiple entries in the diagnosis columns, as shown in the top row of\nFig. 12\n. Those multiple diagnoses have to be spread over multiple rows using\n*fhir_melt()*\n, as shown in the middle row of\nFig. 12\nand subsequently be freed from indices with\n*fhir_rm_indices()*\nas shown in the bottom row of the figure. Then, they can be filtered for comorbidity diagnoses. Finally, the patients with a hypertension comorbidity diagnosis can be identified and the relationship between hypertension and BMI can be examined with suitable statistical routines.\n\n### Application to Real-World Data\n\nTo date, fhircrackr is used in a number of ongoing studies within the German MII. In the use case POLAR 30 it is used for a distributed analysis in 13 university hospitals to detect health risks in patients with polypharmacy. The clinical trial HELP 31 uses the package to evaluate a decision support system for bloodstream infections in five university hospitals. Several smaller studies (e.g., refs. 32 and 33) showcase the usage of the fhircrackr in publicly available GitHub repositories. 34 35\n\nIn all these applications, the analysis is distributed in the form of plain or dockered R scripts via version control platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or DockerHub. The scripts generate tabular data on different levels of abstraction from simple feature extraction to more complex local aggregation for distributed learning approaches. All these approaches are easy to implement once the FHIR data has been made available as tables in R.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Usage of Real-World Data\n\nThe use of nested information from real-world EHR data in data science applications has demonstrated difficulties, and som\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_BVniYD5DgTwruSOVWxDct7WD\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/ouci.dntb.gov.ua\/en\/works\/4NQ3rWV7\/\\\",\\\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/367440346_fhircrackr_An_R_Package_Unlocking_Fast_Healthcare_Interoperability_Resources_for_Statistical_Analysis\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Content from https:\/\/ouci.dntb.gov.ua\/en\/works\/4NQ3rWV7\/\nJournal Article\n\n10.1055\/s-0042-1760436\n\nGeorg Thieme Verlag KG\n\nJulia Palm, Frank A.

Non\u2010motile primary cilia are the organizing hub for extracellular signals. Defective ciliogenesis leads to abnormal embryonic development and disrupted tissue homeostasis, resulting in ciliopathies\u2014a group of developmental and degenerative disorders including Bardet\u2013Biedl syndrome (BBS), Joubert syndrome, polycystic kidney disease and Meckel syndrome 1, 2. The severity of ciliopathy phenotypes ranges from generally mild to congenitally lethal and can include hypogonadism, anosmia, obesity, retinal degeneration, renal dysfunction, developmental delay, speech deficit, syndactyly, dental dysgenesis, ataxia, diabetes mellitus and congenital heart disease 3, 4, 5. The cilia are required for the proper delivery of the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling essential for growth, survival, cell fate and embryonic patterning 6. Hh initiates signalling through activation of Smoothened (SMO) which translocates to primary cilia and modulates the processing of GLI transcription factors 7, 8, to induce downstream target genes 9. Ciliary intraflagellar transport is required for the trafficking of GLI transcription factors to the ciliary tip where SMO is concentrated, and back to the cell body and nucleus 7, 8. Although defective Hh signalling is associated with numerous congenital disorders and cancers 10, its downstream target genes that critically regulate specific organogenesis are poorly understood.\n\nCongenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS) are classically defined by delayed puberty and infertility secondary to gonadotrophin\u2010releasing hormone (GnRH) dysfunction 11. However, CHH\/KS is a complex disease, as the patients can also exhibit developmental defects in various organs including the brain, spinal cord, heart, kidney, skeleton, ear and eye, along with intellectual disability, neurosensory and neuromotor anomalies at reduced penetrance 12. We previously identified WD repeat domain 11 (*WDR11*) as the underlying locus for CHH\/KS based on a break point at 10q26.12 and subsequent identification of five missense mutations 13. A splice site mutation in *WDR11* has also been found in a combined pituitary hormone deficiency disorder 14. *WDR11* is located within the 600\u2010kb minimal microdeletion region associated with the 10q26 deletion syndrome (MIM 609625) 15, 16. WDR11 contains twelve WD domains\u2014minimally conserved motifs of approximately 40 amino acids forming two beta\u2010propellers potentially serving as molecular scaffolds 13. We previously identified the homeobox protein EMX1 as a binding partner of WDR11 in a yeast 2\u2010hybrid screen and CHH\/KS\u2010associated mutations of WDR11 resulted in failed binding of EMX1 13. The nature of their interactions, however, remains unclear. Due to evolutionary conservation and broad tissue expression of WDR11 13, we hypothesized that it may have roles beyond the development of the reproductive system.\n\nHere we report that WDR11 is involved in the Hh signalling pathway and is essential for normal ciliogenesis. *WDR11\u2010*defective mice and zebrafish exhibit complex developmental abnormalities in multiple organs, resembling features known to be associated with Hh signalling and ciliogenesis, thus linking CHH\/KS with ciliopathy spectrum disorders. WDR11 undergoes Hh\u2010dependent intracellular trafficking and interacts with GLI3 and EMX1 to regulate the expression of GnRH. We further show that loss of WDR11 leads to obesity in both mice and men, suggesting that Hh signalling via WDR11 is one of the key links between reproduction and metabolism. *WDR11* may also be an underlying locus for the holoprosencephaly (HPE) spectrum and responsible for many of the phenotypes associated with 10q26 deletion syndrome. Our study proposes a new paradigm for the diagnosis of these genetically overlapping disorders and may expand the disease spectrum of CHH\/KS.\n\n## Results\n\n### Generation of *Wdr11* knockout mouse\n\nTo better comprehend the biological activities of WDR11, we generated a knockout (KO) mouse line Ayu 21\u2010KBW205 by genetrap mutagenesis. Analysis by 5\u2032\u2010RACE, allele\u2010specific PCR, sequencing and Western blot confirmed the insertion of the pU\u201021W vector in exon 3 of the mouse *Wdr11* gene, and functional KO of endogenous *Wdr11* expression (Fig 1A, Appendix Fig S1A, Appendix Table S1). There was no disruption of neighbouring genes *Emx2* and *Fgfr2* (Appendix Fig S1B) that are also located within the 10q26 deletion syndrome region and known to be important in forebrain and genitalia development 15, 16.\n\n### Expression profiles of *Wdr11* in mouse\n\n*Wdr11* is broadly expressed in various adult organs including the brain, eye, ear, lung, heart, kidney and gonads (Appendix Fig S1). In E10.5\u201312.5 embryos, *Wdr11* signal is visible in the ventricles of the heart, branchial arches and mesonephric duct. Expression is also detected in the head mesenchyme, developing eye and forebrain (Fig 1B and Appendix Fig S1C). Detailed analysis of the brain revealed *Wdr11* expression in the GnRH neuronal migratory niche including nasal cavity and cribriform plate area in E12.5 embryo as well as the median eminence in the adult brain, showing co\u2010localization with GnRH (Appendix Fig S2 and S3A). Moreover, *Wdr11* is expressed throughout the developing and adult olfactory bulb (OB) with particularly high levels in the glomerular layer (Fig EV1A).\n\n###\n*Wdr11* deficiency causes retardation of growth and development\n\nGross morphological examination of the embryos and newborn pups revealed significant developmental defects and growth retardation in the null homozygotes (*Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212), compared to the WT (*Wdr11*\n+\/+) and heterozygote (*Wdr11*\n+\/\u2212) littermates (Fig 1C). There was a significant underrepresentation of homozygotes from E13 onwards with less than 6% detected beyond E17.5 (Table 1), suggesting a mid\u2010gestation embryonic lethality. The majority of null mice were either stillborn or died within 1\u20132 days after birth. Rare null individuals survived through adulthood. The null mutants exhibited abnormal digit separation and syndactyly, as well as shortened limbs and hypoplastic skeletons with reduced or absent bone mineralization. The heads of *Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212 mice showed a diminutive and curved nasal midline and a small lower jaw (Fig 1D).\n\n#### Table 1.\n\n| Genotype | |||\n|---|---|---|---|\nWdr11\n+\/+\n|\nWdr11\n+\/\u2212\n|\nWdr11\n\u2212\/\u2212\n|\n|\n| Expected Mendelian ratio | 25% | 50% | 25% |\n| Total observed pups | 34% (86\/251) | 61% (153\/251) | 5%a (12\/251) |\nE12.5b\n|\n28% (12\/43) | 49% (21\/43) | 23% (10\/43) |\n| E14.5 | 30% (18\/60) | 65% (39\/60) | 5%c (3\/60) |\n| E17.5 | 32% (16\/50) | 62% (31\/50) | 6%c (3\/50) |\n| Total observed embryos | 30% (46\/153) | 59% (91\/153) | 10%c (16\/153) |\n| Growth and development delay | 3% (8\/244) | 43% (12\/28) | |\n| Eye defect | 6% (15\/244) | 15% (4\/28) | |\n| Skeletal defect | 32% (9\/28) | ||\n| Heart defect (embryos) | 31% (5\/16) | ||\n| Infertility (pups) | 75% (9\/12) | ||\n| Hydrocephalus (pups) | 33% (4\/12) | ||\n| Ovary cyst (pups, female) | 33% (2\/6) |\n\na\n\nSignificant deviation from the expected Mendelian ratio (*P* < 0.01 \u00d7 10\u22129) by chi\u2010square test.\n\nb\n\nNo significant deviation from the expected ratio by chi\u2010square test.\n\nc\n\nSignificant deviation from the expected ratio (*P* < 0.01) by chi\u2010square test.\n\n###\n*Wdr11*\u2010null mice display features of Holoprosencephaly\n\n*Wdr11*\u2010null mutants exhibited several characteristics of holoprosencephaly (HPE) associated with Hh signal deficiency. Most notable was the small head (microcephaly), with closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism) or single\/absent eyes (microphthalmia\/ anophthalmia), indicative of failed eye field development (Fig 1C and E). In some cases, *Wdr11*\u2010null mutants exhibited exencephaly, indicating a neural tube closure defect, without any sign of spina bifida. The 3D reconstructed images of the mutant embryos by high\u2010resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM) revealed facial features often associated with midline defects such as protruding tongue and fusion of medial nasal processes (Fig 1F). Coronal sections of E18.5 *Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212 brain further demonstrated midline craniofacial defects, including a partially divided forebrain and narrow mid\u2010facial region, along with the hypoplasia of the neuroepithelium, optic eminence, olfactory pit, nasal septum and Rathke's pouch. The developing *Wdr11*\u2010null brain also displayed enlarged ventricles (Fig 1E). We observed a hypoplastic OB with incomplete separation of the telencephalon similar to that in lobar HPE (Fig 1G).\n\nCongenital heart defects have been reported in CHH\/KS 17. We found a double\u2010outlet right ventricle and ventricular septal defects in E12.5 *Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212 hearts (Fig 1H). Sometimes thoracic skeletal defects and lung airway abnormalities accompanied an abnormal heart (Movie EV1). The observed frequencies of these phenotypes with respect to the genotypes are shown (Table 1).\n\n###\n*Wdr11* mutants show hypothalamic GnRH deficiency and pituitary dysgenesis\n\nThe total number of GnRH\u2010positive cells was significantly reduced in *Wdr11* KO mice (Fig 2A). Interestingly, in *Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212 brains, a relative accumulation of GnRH\u2010positive cells under the cribriform plate area compared to the forebrain area was observed, potentially suggesting a delayed migration of GnRH neurons (Appendix Fig S3A). *Wdr11*\u2010null embryos also exhibited dysmorphogenesis of the pituitary gland, such as a bifurcation of the anterior lobe and abnormal shaping of the lumen of Rathke's pouch (Fig 2B). Therefore, we analysed the expression of genes essential for normal hypothalamic\u2013pituitary function using samples from 8\u2010 to 10\u2010week\u2010old age\u2010matched males and dioestrous females. *Wdr11* KO caused a significant reduction in the expression of *Gnrh1*,* Gnrhr, Lhb*,* Fshb, Gh* and *Prl* in females. The null males also showed a significant reduction but not in *Gnrhr and Fshb* (Fig 2C and Appendix Fig S3B), suggesting that female pituitary functions were more severely affected.\n\n###\n*Wdr11* deficiency causes delayed puberty, reproductive dysfunctions and obesity\n\nBoth male and female null mutants showed hypoplasia of the reproductive organs. *Wdr11*\u2010null male mice exhibited underdeveloped external genitalia and microphallus, along with a reduced anogenital distance index (Appendix Fig S4A). The timing of balanopreputial separation was significantly (*P* = 0.00076; *F*\n(2,12) = 24.68) delayed in the null (34 \u00b1 0.32 days, *n* = 5), compared to WT (30 \u00b1 0.55 days, *n* = 5) or heterozygotes (29.4 \u00b1 0.6 days, *n* = 5). *Wdr11*\u2010deficient males had smaller testes with abnormal seminiferous tubules containing fewer spermatozoa and spermatids. Notably, *Wdr11* was expressed throughout sperm flagella (Fig EV1B) and loss of *Wdr11* caused a high frequency (> 50%) of morphologically abnormal sperm, leading to subfertility or infertility (Fig 2D and E). In females, the null mutants had smaller ovaries and uteri, with thin and poorly differentiated walls. *Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212 ovaries showed arrested follicle development with absent corpora lutea and antral follicles. Widespread atresia and haemorrhagic cysts were observed (Fig 2F). *Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212 females exhibited dysregulated oestrous cycles (Appendix Fig S4B).\n\n*Wdr11*\u2010null mice showed substantial growth retardation in terms of body weight (Appendix Fig S4C). However, because they also had a short stature, their body mass index indicated early\u2010onset obesity, while the heterozygotes showed late\u2010onset obesity with signs of a fatty liver (Fig 2G, Appendix Table S3, and Appendix Fig S4D).\n\n###\n*Wdr11* is localized to the primary cilium and required for ciliogenesis\n\nSince Hh signalling requires functional primary cilia and the phenotypes of *Wdr11*\u2010null mutants resemble ciliopathy spectrum disorders, we hypothesized that *Wdr11* deficiency disrupts normal ciliogenesis. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from *Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212 mice exhibited defective ciliogenesis with a significant reduction in the length of the ciliary axoneme and the frequency of ciliated cells, but no defects were found in the formation of the basal body itself (Fig 3A). Since both GnRH neurons and olfactory axons are known to be ciliated *in vivo*\n18, 19, 20, we examined the effects of *Wdr11* KO on the OB and ME. There was significant deprivation of axoneme structures in these organs in *Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212 embryos, indicating disrupted ciliogenesis (Fig EV1A and C). The abnormal choroid plexus present in *Wdr11*\n\u2212\/\u2212 brain, which led to hydrocephalus, contained much fewer epithelial cilia compared to the WT, although the overall axonemal structure appeared normal (Fig 3B).\n\n###\n*Wdr11* knockdown in zebrafish causes developmental defects associated with aberrant Hh signal and ciliogenesis\n\nTo further investigate the function of *WDR11* during vertebrate development and ciliogenesis, we employed a zebrafish model system where the endogenous *wdr11* was knocked down using two non\u2010overlapping antisense morpholinos (MOs) targeting the exon 3\u2013intron 3 (E3I3 MO) and exon 9\u2013intron 9 (E9I9 MO) splice sites, independently injected at the 1\u2010 to 2\u2010cell stage. E3I3 MO caused an inclusion of intron 3, resulting in a predicted in\u2010frame stop codon in intron 3 (Appendix Fig S5A). E9I9 MO caused an exclusion of exon 9, predicting a premature stop codon in exon 10 (Appendix Fig S5B). When we evaluated the general morphology and survival of the embryos at 72 h post\u2010fertilization (hpf) compared to the control embryos, both MOs resulted in comparable developmental defects known to be associated with cilia dysfunction in zebrafish 21. These included microphthalmia, microcephaly, melanocyte disorganization, curved body axis, motility defects and narrow trunk (Fig 4A and B). Since Hh is a major regulator of myogenic differentiation in zebrafish 22, we conducted a birefringence assay to investigate myogenesis and myotome\/muscle fibre organization. We found a substantial reduction in birefringent signal at 72 hpf in both morphants compared to stage\u2010matched controls, indicating impaired muscle fibre alignment, which could underlie their motility defects (Fig 4C). To determine whether altered Hh signalling contributed to this myogenic phenotype, we assessed the expression level of *ptc1* as readout. At 24 hpf, *wdr11* knockdown (KD) caused a reduced expression of *ptc1* in the cranium and myotome (Fig 4D), indicating that *wdr11* is required for appropriate Hh signalling in these structures. Moreover, *wdr11* morphants exhibited aberrant head cartilage formation and cranial\u2013facial dysmorphology, previously associated with Hh and ciliogenesis defects 23, 24. Overall cranial size was short in length with a specific reduction in Meckel's cartilage and palatoquadrate, both components of the lower mandible. Mis\u2010localized development of ceratohyal and ceratobranchial structures was also observed (Fig 4E and Appendix Fig S5C). Since much of the cranial cartilage is neural crest cell (NCC)\u2010derived and melanocyte and head cartilage defects are associated with aberrant NCC migration and defective ciliogenesis 25, we next performed *in situ* hybridization of *sox10* as a marker for the migrating NCC. We found reduced but persistent NCC streaming in the midbrain and pharyngula regions of *wdr11* morphants (Fig 4F and Appendix Fig S5D). However, despite the comparable NCC migration into the diencephalic region, *wdr11* morphants showed a striking absence of *sox10* expression in the OB (Fig 4F, inset). These data suggest that *wdr11* is likely to facilitate cranial NCC migration and is required for olfactory NCC specification.\n\nThe zebrafish OB and pronephros are heavily populated by motile cilia, essential for the detection of odorants and fluid flow. E3I3 or E9I9 MO caused a complete loss or reduction of cilia in the olfactory pits, respectively (Fig 4G and H). Despite the absent cilia, GnRH immunoreactivity was still detectable in the OB area of E3I3 morphants, albeit showing an unusually punctate distribution (Fig 4G). Consistent with a role in OB ciliogenesis, *wdr11* was detected in the ciliary axoneme of OB (Fig 4I). Analysis of the pronephric duct revealed defective ciliogenesis in E3I3 morphants, but not in E9I9, suggesting variable, tissue\u2010specific sensitivity between the MOs (Appendix Fig S5F). Notably, basal bodies still remained intact, implying that *wdr11* may be required for cilia extension and growth, but not for nucleation. Loss of *Wdr11* did not affect normal looping of hearts, a laterality defect frequently associated with defects in nodal cilia (Appendix Fig S5E). Combined, these results are in line with our findings in the mouse model and support an evolutionarily conserved role of *wdr11* in Hh signalling and ciliogenesis.\n\n### Intracellular trafficking of WDR11 in response to Hh signal\n\nTo further understand the role of WDR11 in ciliogenesis and Hh signalling pathway, we conducted intracellular localization analyses *in vitro*. WDR11 co\u2010stained with markers of the axoneme (acetylated tubulin) or basal bodies\/centrosomes (gamma\u2010tubulin) revealed prominent staining of WDR11 around the basal bodies, with occasional axonemal and nuclear staining. WDR11 also exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic distribution with distinctive perinuclear accumulation in most cells in the basal state (Fig 3C and Appendix Fig S6A). WDR11 contains a putative nuclear export signal (**L**QNK**L**PD**L**S**L**\n**)** raising the possibility that WDR11 shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus. To determine whether such movement of WDR11 correlates with Hh signalling, we tested the effects of Hh agonist (purmorphamine), Hh antagonists (cyclopamine) and GLI antagonist (GANT61) in NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells. Purmorphamine treatment did not change the localization pattern of WDR11 compared to solvent treatment, but it stimulated cilia growth. Interestingly, both cyclopamine and GANT61 caused a distinct nuclear accumulation of WDR11, which was comparable to nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B treatment. In contrast, EMX1 remained in the nucleus regardless of treatments (Fig 3D and Appendix Fig S6A), indicating that although EMX1 is a binding partner of WDR11, it does not follow the same intracellular trafficking.\n\n### WDR11 forms a tertiary complex with EMX1 and GLI3 and regulates *GNRH1* and Hh pathway gene expression\n\nBecause WDR11 itself does not contain a nuclear localization signal and its binding partner EMX1 remains exclusively nuclear, we speculated that GLI proteins might mediate WDR11's nuclear trafficking upon Hh signalling.

However, WDR11's role in development is poorly understood. Here, we report that WDR11 modulates the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway and is essential for ciliogenesis. Disruption of WDR11 expression in mouse and zebrafish results in phenotypic characteristics associated with defective Hh signalling, accompanied by dysgenesis of ciliated tissues. *Wdr11*-null mice also exhibit early-onset obesity. We find that WDR11 shuttles from the cilium to the nucleus in response to Hh signalling. WDR11 regulates the proteolytic processing of GLI3 and cooperates with the transcription factor EMX1 in the induction of downstream Hh pathway gene expression and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone production. The CHH\/KS-associated human mutations result in loss of function of WDR11. Treatment with the Hh agonist purmorphamine partially rescues the WDR11 haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Our study reveals a novel class of ciliopathy caused by WDR11 mutations and suggests that CHH\/KS may be a part of the human ciliopathy spectrum.\n\n**\nKeywords:\n**\nWDR11; ciliopathy; hedgehog signal pathway; hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; kallmann syndrome.\n\n\u00a9 2017 The Authors.

They also stated that the first form of life could have come from prebiotic life.\nQ: What source of energy was provided in the early Earth for the creation of early molecules?\nA: The evolution of the early Earth, starting from its origin 4.6 Ga ago, proceeded under the radiation of the early Sun. Extensive physico-chemical transformations in the early atmosphere were initiated by hard UV radiation, powerful electric discharges, meteorite fall, high temperature, and volcanic activity.\nQ: How do scientists think the first organic compounds were formed?\nA: Scientists think that lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earth's early atmosphere. The early atmosphere contained gases such as ammonia, methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. Scientists hypothesize that this created a \u201csoup\u201d of organic molecules from inorganic chemicals.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_con8i06lyjNO4iWwK8HSgv4K\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"substitute models\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Atomnaya Energiya\\\\\\\" 1980 \\\\\\\"substitute\\\\\\\" model \\\\\\\"inverse problem\\\\\\\" geophysics borehole 'substitute models' 'Atomnaya'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"substitute models\" \"Atomnaya Energiya\" 1980 \"substitute\" model \"inverse problem\" geophysics borehole 'substitute models' 'Atomnaya'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_MM8WooO3z5ZzxLq19dVJhSiL\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Atomic Energy\\\\\\\" journal 1980 inverse problem subsurface borehole substitute models \\\\\\\"Atomic Energy\\\\\\\" 1981 1982 1983 \\\\\\\"substitute\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"Atomic Energy\" journal 1980 inverse problem subsurface borehole substitute models \"Atomic Energy\" 1981 1982 1983 \"substitute\"","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_VeqRR7QlCcvIPLS9odtiuoiG\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"\\u0437\\u0430\\u043c\\u0435\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u0430\\u044f \\u043c\\u043e\\u0434\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"\\u0430\\u0442\\u043e\\u043c\\u043d\\u0430\\u044f \\u044d\\u043d\\u0435\\u0440\\u0433\\u0438\\u044f\\\\\\\" \\u0441\\u0442\\u0430\\u0442\\u044c\\u044f 1980 1981 1982 1983 \\u0433\\u0435\\u043e\\u0444\\u0438\\u0437\\u0438\\u043a\\u0430 \\u0441\\u043a\\u0432\\u0430\\u0436\\u0438\\u043d\\u0430\\\", \\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\" \"\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f\" \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f 1980 1981 1982 1983 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_p27Hllql8qZeWAWfp4wz9WpH\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Atomnaya Energiya 1980 'substitute model' 'substitute models' 'inverse problem' 'subsurface' 'borehole'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] Unsaturated Zone Flow and Transport Model Process Model Report\nURL: https:\/\/www.nrc.gov\/docs\/ml0037\/ML003742571.pdf\n1 - Data and model justification: Adequate field, borehole, and underground.

Extensive physico-chemical transformations in the early atmosphere were initiated by hard UV radiation, powerful electric discharges, meteorite fall, high temperature, and volcanic activity.\nQ: Which of the following gases was believed to be important to organic molecule formation?\nA: The early atmosphere contained gases such as ammonia, methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. Scientists hypothesize that this created a \u201csoup\u201d of organic molecules from inorganic chemicals. In 1953, scientists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey used their imaginations to test this hypothesis.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_5LYnQWtxta1Y36a0zId0yROI\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"substitute models\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"inverse problem\\\\\\\" borehole 'substitute model' geophysics 'substitute models' 'inverse'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: GEOPHYSICS: Vol 84, No 4\nURL: https:\/\/library.seg.org\/toc\/gpysa7\/84\/4\nSeismic migration can be formulated as an inverse problem, the model ...

{"example_id":47,"prompt":[{"content":"A mid-19th-century naval vessel, later bearing a name of Teutonic origin associated with a mythological fire deity, was key in the first combat use of a specific type of aerial weapon carrier. This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city.

It made use of cheap, simple balloons filled with hydrogen and carrying either a trailing steel wire to damage high voltage power lines by producing a short circuit, or incendiary devices to start fires in fields, forests and heathland. A total of 99,142 Outward balloons were launched; about half carried incendiaries and half carried trailing wires.[a]\n\nCompared to Japan's better-known fire balloons, Outward balloons were crude. They had to travel a much shorter distance so they flew at a lower altitude \u2013 16,000 ft (4,900 m), compared with 38,000 ft (12,000 m) \u2013 and had only a simple mechanism to regulate altitude by means of dropping ballast or venting lifting gas. This meant the balloons were simple to mass-produce and only cost 35 shillings each (approximately equivalent to \u00a3121 in 2023[3]). The free flying balloon attacks were highly successful. Although difficult to assess exactly, their economic impact on Germany was far in excess of the cost to the British government.[2][4][5]\n\n## History and development\n\n[edit]Because there was concern over what could happen if a barrage balloon accidentally got loose, in 1937 the British carried out a study on the damage that may be caused by a balloon-carried wire hitting power lines.[2] These concerns were evidently borne out when early in 1940, the Air Vice Marshal Balloon Command, the organisation responsible for the barrage balloons, wrote that \"Since the outbreak of the war, I have had constant complaints from the electricity distributors regarding the damage done in this country by [barrage] balloons that have broken away from their moorings\". to which he added \"...advantage might be taken of this to impede and inconvenience the enemy\".[6]\n\nIt was proposed that bomb-laden balloons could be launched from France. Their position would be tracked by radio triangulation and the bombs would be released by radio control when the balloon drifted over a worthwhile target.[7] This plan was never put into action; objections included that \"attacks of this nature should not be originated from a cricketing country\" and a concern that the enemy might retaliate with similar weapons.[2] The idea became redundant when defeat in the Battle of France put possible launch sites out of British control.\n\nWe may make a virtue of our misfortune.\n\n\n[2]\n\nOn the night of 17\/18 September 1940, a gale broke loose a number of British barrage balloons and carried them across the North Sea. In Sweden and Denmark, they damaged power lines, disrupted railways and knocked down the antenna for the Swedish International radio station.[8][2] Five balloons were reported to have reached Finland.[9] A report on the damage and confusion reached the British War Cabinet on 23 September 1940. Winston Churchill then directed that the use of free-flying balloons as weapons against Germany should be investigated.[9][6] The Air Ministry initially produced a negative report, possibly because the Ministry of Aircraft Production felt balloons would be ineffective weapons and would consume too many resources.[2]\n\nTO SUM UP - If D.B.D. [Director of Boom Defences] is given a free hand, he is prepared to guarantee that he could produce an incendiary balloon attack organisation for operating from an East Coast area (say Harwich) which could be built up using women operatives, coal gas \/and\/or hydrogen and to produce the incendiaries, balloons and equipment etc. without recognisable interference to any other service activity, but from the experience obtained in attempting to operate F.B.B. in collaboration with the Air Ministry, it is clear that it should be a Naval and not a combined Naval and Air-Force undertaking.\n\n\n[2]\n\nThe Admiralty took up the idea with more enthusiasm. In particular, Captain Gerald Banister, Director of Boom Defence and a proponent of using balloons as a weapon of offence, pressed the point. The meteorological considerations \u2013 including the possibility that the weather might favour the enemy retaliating in kind \u2013 were carefully investigated and found to be highly favourable; winds above 16,000 feet (4,900 m) tend to blow from west to east, making it difficult for the Germans to retaliate with similar balloons.[10]\n\nOf particular interest was the possibility of damaging Germany's electricity distribution network by shorting high-voltage overhead power lines with thin wires dragged by balloons. The results of investigations were favourable: trials showed that even a thin steel wire, much thinner than that used to tether the static barrage balloons, when drawn in sliding contact across two or more phases, could cause an arc as long as 15 ft (4.6 m) and that arc would be maintained until the circuit breaker opened. In some cases, the arc's heat could melt the aluminium outer layers and then the reinforcing steel centre strands of the conductors. Even if the cable was not severed, the conductors would be weakened so that they would be susceptible to breaking due to increased electrical demand or normal weather events such as wind, snow and ice.[6]\n\nInvestigations revealed that it was common in pre-war Germany to use a Petersen coil as protection against earthing; this design was effective against a short between a high voltage cable and earth but relatively vulnerable to a short between different phases. A short between phases could result in damage, not just to a cable but to transformers and the circuit breakers.[11][6] The Admiralty ran trials using surplus spherical latex meteorological balloons about 8 ft (2.4 m) in diameter when inflated. Calculations based on the trials predicted that there would be between a 10% to 75% chance of a balloon's wire coming into contact with a high-voltage overhead line during a 30 mi (48 km) flight along the ground.\n\nBalloons could also carry incendiaries. Large areas of pine forest and heathland in Germany made the countryside vulnerable to random incendiary attack and it was hoped that the Germans would be forced to assign large numbers of people to the task of fire watching, possibly diverting them from more productive war-work. The Admiralty concluded that the balloons could be produced at very little cost; many of the important parts already existed as surplus materials and despite the needs of conventional barrage balloons, there was plenty of hydrogen gas with which to fill the balloons.[2] The balloons could be used with a small number of British personnel who would face minimal risks.\n\n## Design\n\n[edit]The balloons used were surplus weather balloons of which the Navy had a stock of 100,000 all carefully stored in French chalk.[11] Using this surplus was important to the practicality of Operation Outward because white latex rubber from which they were made was an important war material that was in short supply.[12] The balloons were about 8 ft (2.4 m) in diameter when inflated.[b] They carried a simple timing and regulating mechanism that was based upon a design developed for Operation Albino \u2013 a plan to use somewhat larger latex balloons as anti-aircraft weapons.[c]\n\nAt launch, a slow-burning fuse was lit; its length was calibrated to the estimated time to arrive over German-controlled territory. At first, the balloon rose rapidly and expanded in size until an internal cord tightened, preventing further increase in altitude beyond 25,000 ft (7,600 m) by releasing some gas; the balloon would then begin a slow descent due to the hydrogen gradually leaking away.[6] After a while, the slow burning fuse would release a bung in a can of mineral oil; as the oil slowly dripped out, the balloon's payload would lighten, arresting its descent. The same slow-burning fuse was also used to release the balloon's weapon. There were a number of payload designs designated: *wire*, *beer*, *jelly*, *socks*, *lemon*, and *jam*.\n\n*Wire*\n\n[edit]About half of the Outward balloons carried the *wire* payload. In the case of the *wire*, the slow burning fuse would burn through the cord that held the trailing wire. The trailing wire consisted of about 700 ft (210 m) of 1\u204416 in (1.6 mm) diameter hemp cord with a breaking strength of 40 lb (18 kg). The hemp cord was attached to 300 ft (91 m) of 0.072 in (1.8 mm) diameter (15 gauge) steel wire.[6] Tests had revealed that the main reason for the trailing wire getting caught up in ground obstacles was \"springiness\" at the end of the wires; this was addressed by obtaining special straightened wire.[11]\n\nAt the same time as the trailing wire was deployed, a stopper on the canister of mineral oil was released so that it would assist in maintaining altitude by slowly dripping out and lightening the load on the balloon.[6] It was calculated that the balloon should have a slightly negative lift of about 1 lb (0.45 kg) so that the balloon would descend until a short length of the wire had its weight taken by the ground. The long length of hemp cord allowed the balloon to maintain an altitude of about 1,000 ft (300 m) which would reduce the chance of the balloon being becalmed in still air.\n\nThe plan was that the wire tail would be dragged for about 30 mi (48 km) across the land and eventually encounter a high-voltage transmission line.[6] A phase-to-phase short circuit would be initiated; during trials, arcs 15 ft (4.6 m) long were initiated by the wire.[6] The arc would burn for some time before the transmission line protection operated; there was a good chance the circuit breaker would be damaged and the conductors might burn through due to arcing. This could cause a line to collapse and require repairs. German efforts to protect transmission lines from attack were unsuccessful: neither a new type of line conductor clamp nor different over-current protection settings had any useful effect.[6]\n\n*Beer*, *jelly* and *socks*\n\n[edit]*Beer*, *jelly* and *socks* were incendiary devices.\n\n*Beer* consisted of a cylindrical metal container 8+1\u20442 in (22 cm) in diameter and 9 in (23 cm) long containing seven or eight half-pint bottles.[16] Each bottle was a Self-igniting phosphorus (SIP) grenade[15] \u2013 it contained white phosphorus, benzene, water and a strip of raw rubber, two in (5.1 cm) long, which dissolved and formed a layer. After a delay caused by a slow burning fuse, the metal container was tipped open and its contents allowed to fall out. Around the neck of each bottle was a small metal sleeve that held a heavy ball about one in (25 mm) in diameter.[16] The ball was attached to a strip of canvas; this ensured that when the bottles dropped they fell the right way round.[16][17] The SIP grenades would spontaneously ignite on shattering.\n\n*Jelly* were cans of incendiary jelly.[18] Each cuboid can measured about 11+1\u20442 in \u00d7 6+1\u20442 in \u00d7 4 in (29 cm \u00d7 17 cm \u00d7 10 cm) and contained one imp gal (4.5 L) of jelly.[19] A release mechanism and a fuse were provided; on ignition a fireball erupted with a radius of about 20 ft (6.1 m).[19]\n\n*Socks* were long thin canvas bags of incendiary material each weighing about 6 lb (2.7 kg). Socks were packed with wood wool, bound with wire and soaked in boiling paraffin wax.[2][17] Each Outward balloon could carry three socks. The bundle measured about 27 in \u00d7 10 in \u00d7 10 in (690 mm \u00d7 250 mm \u00d7 250 mm).[19] When dropped, socks formed a V\u2011shaped sausage designed to catch in the crown of a tree.[2] Fuses were inserted in each end of the device and it would burn from each end for 15 minutes.[2] In 1941 the Royal Navy had a stock of 10,000 such socks already fused and ready to be used and another 20,000 bodies that could be brought forward as required.[2][d]\n\n*Lemon* and *jam*\n\n[edit]All the payloads that are clearly code named and described are either a trailing wire or an incendiary. *Small yellow bombs* left over from Operation Albino were also used and it seems likely that these are identified by one of these code words.[20][21] It is possible that the other was used to drop leaflets \u2013 there are occasional, vague mentions of leaflet drops in the records.[2]\n\n## Deployment\n\n[edit]After a lengthy bureaucratic struggle between the opponents in the Air Ministry and proponents in the Admiralty, the British Chiefs of Staff gave the go\u2011ahead in September 1941 and a launch site was set up, based at HMS *Beehive*, a Royal Navy shore establishment near Felixstowe in Suffolk. The actual balloon releases took place at the Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club.[22] The first launches took place on 20 March 1942. Within days, the British were receiving reports of forest fires near Berlin and Tilsit in East Prussia.[23]\n\nThe personnel that launched the balloons were six Royal Navy and Royal Marine officers, 80 Royal Marines, 7 Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) officers and 140 non-commissioned WRNS.[2] The operation also required the assistance of the RAF Balloon Command (that supplied and delivered the hydrogen) and the Naval Meteorological Services.[2] The balloons were inflated using hydrogen from pressure cylinders that were brought to the launch site by truck. They were inflated inside three-sided tents or windbreaks. During inflation, it was necessary to keep the latex wet with a water spray \u2013 otherwise, friction between the balloon and the tent canvas might have caused the hydrogen to ignite. The inflated balloons were conveyed by hand to a dispersal point, where their payload was attached.\n\nBalloon operations could be hazardous, and there were many instances of launch crew requiring hospital treatment for burns caused by exploding balloons or by mishandling incendiary payloads.[24] The WRNS were equipped with \"flash-proof jacket & hood (\u00bd mica & \u00bd fine copper gauze over the face) + protective cream on hands and fire-proof black gloves\".[e]\n\nFor security reasons, the Felixstowe launch crews were referred to as a \"Boom-defence\" unit, a cover story that was partly true as they were put to work maintaining anti-submarine nets when weather conditions were not right for balloon launches. The Felixstowe golf club site had a number of Lewis Guns for anti-aircraft defence, which the WRNS women were trained to operate, occasionally releasing balloons for the purpose of target practice.[26]\n\n| Period | Wire | Beer | Jelly | Socks | Lemon | Jam | Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| \"ordinary\" (20 March 1942 to 7 February 1944) | 54,369\n|\n24,075\n|\n5,900\n|\n9,291\n|\n-\n|\n-\n|\n96,625\n|\n| \"trickle\" (29 April 1944 to 4 September 1944) | 230\n|\n2,808\n|\n1,596\n|\n253\n|\n899\n|\n739\n|\n6,517\n|\n| Total | 54,599\n|\n26,883\n|\n7,496\n|\n9,644\n|\n899\n|\n739\n|\n99,142 |\n\n## Effects\n\n[edit]The British were keen to assess the effectiveness of Operation Outward. Intercepts of Luftwaffe communications soon showed German fighters were trying to shoot down balloons. This encouraged the British as it was felt that the harassment value on German air defences alone justified Operation Outward \u2013 it cost the Germans more, in fuel and wear and tear on aircraft, to destroy each balloon than it cost the British to make them. Later, reports were received revealing damage to electricity supplies and fires in forests and on farms.[27] Most of these reports were gleaned from newspaper reports in Denmark, France and other occupied countries where the German authorities tried to paint the British attacks in an unfavourable light.[27]\n\nAfter the war, German records revealed that the trailing wire attacks had caused the Germans considerable inconvenience with electricity supplies frequently being interrupted and significant damage to the electrical distribution network.[2] A 1946 report concluded that, based on available records, \u00a31,500,000 of damage was done (approximately equivalent to \u00a369 million in 2023[3]).[4] The report also stated that the actual amount of damage must have been far higher because the records were incomplete with no available records for the Russian zone and all records becoming less reliable after 1943.[4] The Germans had attempted to record interrupts to the lower voltage lines but the incidents were so frequent that the recording was abandoned.[2] In addition to sending up fighters, the Germans used anti-aircraft fire against the balloons, sometimes shut down electric cables when an attack was anticipated, and modified the circuit breakers on high voltage networks.[2]\n\nIn July 1942, a second launch site was set up at Oldstairs Bay near Dover.[23] On 12 July 1942, a wire-carrying balloon struck a 110 kV power line near Leipzig. A failure in the circuit breaker at the B\u00f6hlen power station caused a fire that destroyed the station;[1] this was Outward's greatest success.[6]\n\nThe effects of the incendiary attacks were very difficult to assess \u2013 it could be difficult to tell whether any particular fire was caused by *Outward* or by an accident, sabotage, or aircraft-dropped incendiary. Intelligence sources, including reports from newspapers printed in occupied Europe, indicated that some fires had definitely been caused by Outward.[27] Outward caused damage in neutral countries \u2013 on the night of 19\/20 January 1944, two trains collided at Laholm in Sweden after an Outward balloon knocked out electrical lighting on the railway.[1] Changing winds could also blow balloons back to the United Kingdom. On one occasion, a balloon knocked out the electricity supply to the town of Ipswich.[28]In addition, failures in the altitude adjustment mechanism caused such balloons to fall in Belgium in an area ranging from Tournai to Andenne.[29]\n\n## End of the operation\n\n[edit]In August 1942, launches reached 1,000 per day and later increased to attacks involving up to 1,800 balloons all launched over a period of three to four hours.[27] Balloon launches continued, though they were frequently suspended when there were large air raids on Germany as it was feared the balloons might damage Allied bombers.[27] From May 1944 it was decided to change tactics because of increased Allied aircraft activity. The mass balloon launches were stopped and replaced with a \"trickle\" of balloons launched from three sites at ten-minute intervals throughout daylight hours.[27]\n\nOnly 2% of the balloons were to be of the trailing wire type.[27] The \"trickle system\" was not thought to be a significant threat to Allied aircraft so it could go on uninterrupted.[27] The trickle system simplified the hydrogen supply requirements of the launch sites and released transport vehicles and compressed gas cylinders needed for operations against German V-1 flying bombs and for the Normandy landings.[27] The last balloons were launched on 4 September 1944.[1]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- Footnotes\n\n**^**Sources agree on the total number but vary as to the exact proportions of wire and incendiary payloads, Peebles gives a little more than half to incendiaries,[1]National Archive records vary slightly but give a little more than half to trailing wires.[2]**^**An eight foot diameter hydrogen filled balloon might be expected to lift 18.66 lb (8.46 kg).[13]**^**Operation Albino was a plan to use many free balloons to form an aerial minefield. Each Albino balloon would carry a long wire with a parachute at the bottom and a*small yellow bomb*at the top. If an aircraft caught the wire, the drag of the parachute would cause the bomb to be drawn down onto the aircraft where it would explode on contact. Albino was tried but was not particularly successful.[14][15]**^**If one Outward balloon carried three socks then the 9,644*sock*payloads mentioned in the records would have almost exactly used this supply.**^**WRNS Cecilia Banister quoted by Finley.[25]**^**The figures in the table come directly from a document in the National Archive.

It was a New Zealand squadron formed under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Plan. Although many of its flying personnel were largely drawn from the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the squadron served in Europe under the operational and administrative command of the Royal Air Force.\n\nFormed in March 1942 and equipped with Hawker Hurricane fighters, No. 486 Squadron became operational late the following month, initially flying patrols protecting convoys making their way through the North Sea. Although trained in a night fighting role it soon became a day fighter squadron, operating Hawker Typhoon fighters. From late 1942 to early 1943, it was tasked with intercepting incoming raids mounted by Luftwaffe fighter bombers. It was then switched to offensive operations, escorting bombers attacking targets in France and then flying in a fighter bomber role. In early 1944 the squadron re-equipped with the Hawker Tempest. In the run up to D-Day, it attacked numerous military targets in France and the Low Countries. For several weeks following D-Day, it was called upon to deal with incoming V-1 flying bombs launched at England by the Germans. It began operating from the continent in September, supporting the operations of the advancing Allied ground forces as they advanced in France, and then into Belgium, Holland and Germany itself. After the war it briefly served in Denmark and on occupation duties in Germany. It was disbanded in October 1945.\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]In the mid-1930s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was in the process of expanding and required an increasing number of suitable flying personnel. A number of schemes were implemented for New Zealanders to obtain short-service commissions in the RAF with the intention of then transferring to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) in the future. This led to over 500 New Zealanders serving in the RAF by the time of the outbreak of the Second World War.[1]\n\nAt around the same time there was discussion between the governments of Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand to facilitate the co-ordination of training of air crew in the event of hostilities. This led to the implementation of the Empire Air Training Scheme (ETAS) in December 1939. Under this agreement, New Zealand committed to initially supply 880 full trained pilots for the RAF, with another 520 pilots being trained to an elementary standard annually. As each of the Dominion governments desired its personnel to serve together, the ETAS had a clause, Article XV, that allowed for the establishment of squadrons with personnel from the respective countries. In theory, the Dominions would supply the ground crew as well as flying personnel. However, in New Zealand's case, there was a reluctance to maintain RNZAF squadrons in Britain so the decision was made to allow for the formation of squadrons within the RAF designated as being New Zealand. These squadrons, known as Article XV squadrons, were formed around a cadre of New Zealand flying personnel already serving in the RAF but supplemented by newly trained pilots from the RNZAF, with administrative and ground crew being predominantly British.[2][3]\n\n## Formation\n\n[edit]No. 486 Squadron was formed on 3 March 1942 at RAF Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, and was the second New Zealand squadron in Fighter Command.[4][Note 1] The squadron's motto, in M\u0101ori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, was *Hiwa hau Maka*, or *Beware of the Wild Winds* in English. A kea volant was selected as its badge.[6]\n\nThe squadron's first commanding officer, Squadron Leader C. L. Roberts, was British, while his two flight commanders, Flight Lieutenants John Clouston and Harvey Sweetman, along with all of the squadron's other flying personnel, were New Zealanders.[7] By the end of March, the squadron was at its full complement of 25 pilots. Allocated the code letters SA, it was initially equipped with Hawker Hurricane IIs and trained in a night fighting role. It soon moved to Wittering where it was tasked with working in conjunction with No. 1453 Flight. This involved radar-equipped but unarmed Turbinlite aircraft, Douglas A-20 Havoc medium bombers with a searchlight in the nose, locating and illuminating enemy aircraft at which point an accompanying Hurricane could make the attack. These experimental trials with No. 1453 Flight were not particularly successful and were soon abandoned.[8]\n\nThe squadron also carried out convoy patrols and its first operational flight, made on 27 April by Sweetman and Pilot Officer Arthur Umbers, was in this capacity. Sweetman was responsible for the squadron's first aerial victory, when he shot down a Dornier Do 17 medium bomber near Peterborough one night in early July.[4][6][Note 2]\n\n## Channel Front\n\n[edit]### 1942\n\n[edit]In late July, the squadron began re-equipping with Hawker Typhoons, in anticipation of switching to a role as a day fighter unit. It moved to the south of England in late August, settling first at North Weald and then West Malling, before a shift to Tangmere in October from where it would operate for over a year.[4][6]\n\nIn September, No. 486 Squadron began flying standing patrols, meant to counter incoming Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter bombers that flew at high speed, and very low altitude, to avoid being detected by radar, to make sneak attacks on targets along the coastline of England. The squadron's patrol area extended from the Isle of Wight to Shoreham, near Brighton. On 17 October the squadron achieved its first success in its new role, when two of its pilots intercepted two Fw 190s and managed to shoot one of them down into the sea. It then went several weeks without a successful interception but once low level radar stations had been established along the coast in early December, earlier detection of incoming Luftwaffe raids was possible. The squadron's interception rates improved and on 17 December, two Bf 109s were shot down. At least five more German aircraft were destroyed by the end of the year.[10]\n\n### 1943\n\n[edit]The patrols over the South coast against the Luftwaffe's raids continued into early 1943 and by April, the squadron had achieved 11\u00bd aerial victories, mostly fighter-bombers but also the odd Dornier Do 217 bomber engaged in mine laying missions.[11][12] The need for standing patrols began to decline as the effectiveness of the RAF's early detection of incoming raids increased, and instead sections of aircraft were kept on standby, ready to take off as soon as notice was received of approaching German aircraft.[13] By the middle of the year, Luftwaffe resources did not permit the ongoing sneak attacks as its focus shifted to intercepting the increasing Allied bombing raids on Germany.[14]\n\nConsequently, No. 486 Squadron switched to an offensive role, the transition in tactics was overseen by Squadron Leader Desmond Scott, who had taken command of the squadron from Roberts in April. The squadron initially flew as escorts to bombers and fighter bombers carrying out daylight bombing missions on targets in France and the Low Countries. By the middle of the year, it was itself operating in a fighter bomber role, attacking targets in Caen, Abbeville, Triqueville, Boulogne, Cherbourg and Le Havre. It also attacked shipping along the French coastline. During this time, the first Distinguished Flying Cross to be received by personnel flying with No. 486 Squadron was awarded: the recipient was Flying Officer Frank Murphy, who was credited with 4 aerial victories.[15][16]\n\nIn September, No. 486 Squadron became part of the Tangmere Typhoon Wing. The squadron was now led by Squadron Leader Ian Waddy, who had originally joined the squadron as a flight sergeant, as Scott had been promoted to wing commander and given command of the Typhoon Wing.[17] As part of the Typhoon Wing, the operations of the squadron continued mostly unchanged; it either flew in a fighter bomber role, escorted by the other two squadrons of the wing, or did escort duty itself. In some instances, the entire wing flew as fighter escort to medium or heavy bombers attacking targets in France. It also flew the occasional aerial search and rescue mission and on one of these, the rescued crew presented the squadron with the centre board of their life boat. This was subsequently used as the squadron's scoreboard.[18]\n\n## Operations against V-1 flying bombs\n\n[edit]Coinciding with the appointment of Squadron Leader John Iremonger as its commander, No. 486 Squadron began re-equipping with the new Hawker Tempest in January 1944. However, before it reached its full complement, the Tempests were subsequently transferred to No. 3 Squadron and the New Zealanders continued to operate their Typhoons.[6] At this time, it was tasked with attacking the launching sites of the new V-1 flying bombs in northern France, as well seeking out German aircraft and their airfields.[19]\n\nIn April it began receiving Tempests again and by 1 May was operational with its new aircraft.[6] At this time, the squadron became part of No. 150 Wing, along with Nos. 3 and 56 Squadrons, under the command of Wing Commander Roland Beamont.[20] Writing about the New Zealanders under his command, Beamont described them as:\n\n\"...an exuberant bunch of New Zealanders with a brilliant record on Typhoons and a rather casual approach (as I was soon to find out) to King's Regulations and Air Council instructions \u2013 and to \"Pommy Bastard\" wing leaders!\"\n\n[21]\n\nFlying with No. 150 Wing as part of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, the squadron carried out attacks on transportation infrastructure in northern France, as well as on shipping along the coastline. In the five weeks prior to the Allied invasion of Normandy, it flew 208 sorties.[22] However, when the Germans started launching V-1 flying bombs at England, beginning on the night of 12\u201313 June,[23] the squadron was tasked to deal with the threat as the Tempest was the fastest fighter plane available to the RAF. Along with No. 3 Squadron, also equipped with Tempests, it operated from Newchurch, a steel mesh field near Folkestone. Conditions were primitive, with personnel living in tents. By the end of August, No. 486 Squadron claimed 223\u00bd V-1 flying bombs as destroyed, the second highest number of any unit. The most successful of the squadron's pilots were Owen Eagleson and Raymond Cammock who both accounted at least 20 V-1s each. However, three pilots were killed during the squadron's campaign against the V-1s.[24][25]\n\n## Service with the Second Tactical Air Force\n\n[edit]In late September, with the V-1 threat over, No. 150 Wing was re-designated as No. 122 Tempest Wing,[26] and was attached to the Second Tactical Air Force. It now began operating from airfields in France as the Allied ground forces moved through Belgium and Holland, the wing provided aerial support and cover.[27] Umbers, who was a founding member of the squadron and served with it until he was posted away in September 1943, returned on 11 December to take command of his former unit. At the time, it was flying from the Volkel airfield in Holland.[28] On 25 December, two of its pilots, Jack Stafford and Duff Bremner, shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter jet. Normally the jet fighter would outpace the Tempests but Stafford and Bremner made a head-on engagement rather than attempt a chase. The Me 262 was damaged and, slowing down, was finished off by the duo and crashed near Aachen.[29]\n\nPoor weather affected operations for the first weeks of 1945 but No. 486 Squadron soon began flying well into Germany to attack transportation infrastructure and seek out targets of opportunity.[6] Umbers was killed on 14 February while attacking barges on the Dortmund-Ems Canal, near Meppen. His Tempest was hit by flak, rolled out of control into the ground and exploded.[30] He was replaced by one of the squadron's flight leaders, Keith Taylor-Cannon.[31] The squadron switched tactics in March; casualties in No. 122 Wing's operations against ground targets had been high and it was decided that the Tempests would now carry out wide-ranging sweeps, hunting out the Luftwaffe.[32]\n\nNo. 486 Squadron flew in support of the crossing of the Rhine on 23 March, dealing with anti-aircraft guns that were firing upon the Allied gliders involved in the operation.[33] From 10 April, the squadron began moving to an airfield near Hopsten, within Germany itself. It became operational from there on 12 April and the following day its commander, Taylor-Cannon, went missing. It has been speculated that, seen to have bailed out of his stricken aircraft, he was murdered by the German troops that he had been strafing. Alternative reports had Taylor-Cannon dying of wounds in hospital. Postwar investigations were unable to locate his grave.[30][34]\n\nWith Taylor-Cannon missing, Flight Lieutenant Warren Schrader took over command in an acting capacity before being promoted to squadron leader and confirmed in his appointment on 21 April.[35] However, Schrader, who had been one of the most successful fighter pilots in the preceding few weeks having destroyed a number of German aircraft during this time, was soon given command of No. 616 Squadron, the first in the RAF to be equipped with the Gloster Meteor jet fighter. He was succeeded by the squadron's final commander, Jim Sheddan, on 1 May.[36] The final sortie of the war for No. 486 Squadron was carried out a few days later, on 5 May, and involved several Tempests escorting a Douglas Dakota DC-3 to Copenhagen.[37]\n\nSoon after the war ended, No. 486 Squadron left No. 122 Wing and moved to Kastrup in Denmark. This was considered to be a \"perk job\" and the personnel of 486 were given an opportunity to unwind and relax, with each pilot being expected to log four hours of Tempest flying per month.[38] On 1 July 1945 the squadron took part in an air display and airfield open day which was attended by the Danish royal family and some 300,000 Danes. One of the attractions was the strafing and sinking of old Luftwaffe Blohm und Voss Bv 138 flying boats anchored in \u00d8resund strait.[39]\n\nNo. 486 Squadron remained in Denmark until July when it went back to Germany, stationed at L\u00fcbeck as part of No. 124 Wing, an element of the British Occupation Force.[39] It returned to the United Kingdom in September and its service ended on 12 October 1945 with the disbandment of the squadron at Dunsfold.[40][41]\n\n## Operational summary\n\n[edit]No. 486 Squadron flew over 11,000 sorties and claimed 81 enemy aircraft as destroyed, another 5 probably destroyed and 22 damaged.[42][43] Although squadron pilots claimed 241 V-1s as destroyed, RAF authorities reduced this to 223\u00bd; in spite of this the individual pilot's scores remained unaltered, as did the squadron scoreboard.[44] When operating against ground or sea targets, it was responsible for the destruction of 323 motor vehicles, 14 railway engines and 16 ships.[42][43]\n\nWhile flying Typhoons, No. 486 Squadron claimed 22\u2153 enemy aircraft as destroyed. Following the switch to Tempests, it claimed 59\u00bd enemy aircraft shot down; it was the most successful of the squadrons flying the Tempest. No. 56 Squadron was second with 59\u00bc.[11][45]\n\nPilots serving with the squadron were awarded a Distinguished Service Order, 22 Distinguished Flying Crosses and six Mentioned in Dispatches.[46]\n\n## Commanding officers\n\n[edit]The following served as commanding officers of No. 486 Squadron:[47]\n\n- Squadron Leader C. L. C. Roberts (March 1942\u2013April 1943);\n- Squadron Leader D. J. Scott (April\u2013September 1943);\n- Squadron Leader I. D. Waddy (September 1943\u2013January 1944);\n- Squadron Leader J. H.

It was damaged in a forced landing on 1 October and was subsequently used by No. 151 Repair Unit as a test airframe for repaired engines. It is being restored by Kermit Weeks in Florida.[48]\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]### Footnotes\n\n[edit]### Citations\n\n[edit]**^**McGibbon 2000, p. 8.**^**McGibbon 2000, pp. 156\u2013157.**^**Thompson 1953, pp. 209\u2013211.- ^\n**a****b**Thompson 1953, pp. 335\u2013336.**c** **^**Rawlings 1976, p. 449.- ^\n**a****b****c****d****e**Rawlings 1976, pp. 451\u2013452.**f** **^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 5.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 14\u201316.**^**Mitchell 1945, p. 162.**^**Thompson 1953, pp. 355\u2013358.- ^\n**a**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 339\u2013340.**b** **^**Mitchell 1945, p. 164.**^**Thompson 1956, pp. 200\u2013201.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 199.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 203.**^**Mitchell 1945, pp. 165\u2013166.**^**Mitchell 1945, pp. 167\u2013168.**^**Thompson 1956, pp. 206\u2013207.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 265.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 145.**^**Beamont 1992, p. 21.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 266.**^**Lambert 2011, p. 324.**^**Lambert 2011, pp. 327\u2013330.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 193.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 177.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 333.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 190.**^**Lambert 2011, p. 353.- ^\n**a**Lambert 2014, pp. 193\u2013194.**b** **^**Lambert 2011, p. 352.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 229.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 229\u2013230.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 242.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 254.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 266\u2013268.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 275.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 281\u2013283.- ^\n**a**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 289\u2013290.**b** **^**Thompson 1956, pp. 458\u2013459.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 295\u2013296.- ^\n**a**Thompson 1956, p. 459.**b** - ^\n**a**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 338\u2013352.**b** **^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 172\u2013173.**^**Thomas & Shores 1988, p. 193.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 336.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 337.**^**\"Hawker Tempest Mk.

The Tempest, originally known as the *Typhoon II*, was a significantly improved derivative of the Hawker Typhoon, intended to address the Typhoon's unexpected deterioration in performance at high altitude by replacing its wing with a thinner laminar flow design. Since it had diverged considerably from the Typhoon, it was renamed *Tempest*. The Tempest emerged as one of the most powerful fighters of World War II and at low altitude was the fastest single-engine propeller-driven aircraft of the war.[2]\n\nUpon entering service in 1944, the Tempest performed low-level interception, particularly against the V-1 flying bomb threat, and ground attack supporting major invasions like Operation Market Garden. Later, it successfully targeted the rail infrastructure in Germany and *Luftwaffe* aircraft on the ground, as well as countering similar attacks by German fighters. The Tempest was effective in the low-level interception role, including against newly developed jet-propelled aircraft like the Messerschmitt Me 262.\n\nThe further-developed Tempest II did not enter service until after the end of hostilities. It had several improvements, including being tropicalised for combat against Japan in South-East Asia as part of the Commonwealth Tiger Force.\n\n## Design and development\n\n[edit]### Origins\n\n[edit]During development of the earlier Hawker Typhoon, the design team, under the leadership of Sydney Camm, had already planned out a series of design improvements; these improvements culminated in the *Hawker P. 1012*, otherwise known as the *Typhoon II* or \"Thin-Wing Typhoon\".[3][4] Although the Typhoon was generally considered to be a good design, Camm and his design team were disappointed with the performance of its wing, which had proved to be too thick in its cross section, and thus created airflow problems which inhibited flight performance, especially at higher altitudes and speeds where it was affected by compressibility. The Typhoon's wing, which used a NACA 4 digit series wing section, had a maximum thickness-to-chord ratio of 19.5 per cent (root) to 12 per cent (tip),[5] in comparison to the Supermarine Spitfire's 13.2 per cent tapering to 6 per cent at the tip, the thinner design being deliberately chosen to reduce drag.[6][nb 1] Other problems had been experienced with the Typhoon, such as engine unreliability, lack of structural integrity, and the inability to perform high altitude interception duties.[7]\n\nIn March 1940, engineers were assigned to investigate the new low\u2013drag laminar flow wing developed by NACA in the United States, which was later used in the North American P-51 Mustang. A laminar flow wing adopted for the Tempest series had a maximum thickness-to-chord ratio of 14.5 per cent at the root, tapering to 10 per cent at the tip.[5][7] The maximum thickness of the Tempest wing was set further back at 37.5 per cent of the chord versus 30 per cent for the Typhoon's wing, reducing the thickness of the wing root by five inches on the new design.[5][7] The wingspan was originally greater than that of the Typhoon at 43 ft (13 m), but the wingtips were later \"clipped\" and the wing became shorter; 41 ft (12 m) versus 41 ft 7 in (12.67 m).[5]\n\nThe wing planform was changed to a near-elliptical shape to accommodate the 800 rounds of ammunition for the four 20 mm Hispano cannons, which were moved back further into the wing. The new wing had greater area than the Typhoon's,[nb 2] but the new wing design sacrificed the leading edge fuel tanks of the Typhoon. To make up for this loss in capacity, Hawker engineers added a new 21 in (53 cm) fuel bay in front of the cockpit, with a 76 Igal (345 L) fuel tank.[4][5] In addition, two inter-spar wing tanks, each of 28 Igal (127 L), were fitted on either side of the centre section and, starting with late model Tempest Vs, a 30 Igal (136 L) tank was carried in the leading edge of the port wingroot, giving the Tempest a total internal fuel capacity of 162 Igal (736 L).[8]\n\nAnother important feature of the new wing was Camm's proposal that the radiators for cooling the engine be fitted into the leading edge of the wing inboard of the undercarriage. This eliminated the distinctive \"chin\" radiator of the Typhoon and improved aerodynamics.[5][7] A further improvement of the Tempest wing over that of the Typhoon was the exceptional, flush-riveted surface finish, essential on a high-performance laminar flow airfoil.[9] The new wing and airfoil, and the use of a four-bladed propeller, acted to eliminate the high frequency vibrations that had plagued the Typhoon.[10] The design team also chose to use the new Mark IV version of the Napier Sabre H-block 24 cylinder engine for the Tempest, drawings of which had become available to Hawker in early 1941.[11]\n\nIn February 1941, Camm commenced a series of discussions with officials within the Ministry of Aircraft Production on the topic of the P.1012.[11] In March 1941 of that year, clearance to proceed with development of the design, referred to at this point as the Typhoon II, was granted. The design at the time encompassed the Sabre E.107C (as it was then known) with a four-blade propeller, 42 ft span elliptical wing with six cannon armament; while the front of the fuselage was redesigned the rear was unchanged from the Typhoon.[12] At this point, work was undertaken by a team of 45 draughtsmen at Hawker's wartime experimental design office at Claremont, Esher to convert the proposal into technical schematics from which to commence manufacture.[11] In March 1941, the Air Ministry issued specification F.10\/41 that had been written to fit the aircraft. The performance estimate given to MAP was 455 mph at 26,000 ft.[12] In September Camm was told that the Air Ministry's Director of Technical Development that they had decided to have two Typhoons converted to the new design. By October 1941, development of the proposal had advanced to the point where the new design was finalised.[11]\n\n### Prototypes\n\n[edit]On 18 November 1941, a contract was issued by the Air Ministry for a pair of prototypes of the \"Typhoon Mark II\"; the new fighter was renamed \"Tempest\" on 28 February 1942.[5][11][nb 3][a] Complications were added to the Tempest program by external factors in the form of engine issues: the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine and corresponding Hawker Tornado aircraft which was being developed in parallel to the Typhoon were both terminated. This measure turned out to be prudent, as engine development was not trouble-free on some of the variants of the Tempest.[13] The Bristol Centaurus radial engine was now also considered for equipping the Typhoon and Camm was forewarned in October 1941 to expect a request for a Centaurus to be fitted. This was confirmed in February as an order for six prototypes with the Centaurus; the DTD stating that the development was highest priority.[12]\n\nDelays with the Sabre IV development affected the project. With the expected first flight date for the Tempest was September 1942, the engine for *HM595* was changed to a Sabre II complete with the Typhoon cooling system and under nose radiator.[12] Due to this previous experience on other programmes, the Air Ministry was sufficiently motivated to request that Tempest prototypes be built using different engines so that, if a delay hit one engine, an alternative powerplant would already be available.[11] An order was approved for six more prototypes with alternate engines in May and the contract for two with Sabres, two with Centaurus and two with Rolls Royce Griffons followed in June.[12]\n\nThe six prototypes built were as follows:[14][15]\n\n- One Tempest Mk.I (serial number\n*HM599*), equipped with the Napier Sabre Mk.IV engine - Two Tempest Mk.II (serial numbers\n*LA602*and*LA607*), equipped with the Bristol Centaurus Mk.IV engine (LA607 later receiving a Centaurus Mk.V)[16] - One Tempest Mk.III (serial number\n*LA610*), equipped with the Rolls-Royce Griffon 85 engine (originally planned for the Griffon IIB)[17] - One Tempest Mk.IV (serial number\n*LA614*), which was never completed but planned to be equipped with a Griffon 61 engine - One Tempest Mk.V (serial number\n*HM595*), equipped with the Napier Sabre Mk.II engine\n\nThe Tempest Mk.I featured other new features, such as a clean single-piece sliding canopy in place of the car-door framed canopy, and it used wing radiators instead of the \"chin\" radiator.[nb 4] Due to development difficulties with the Sabre IV engine and its wing radiators, the completion of the Mk.I prototype, *HM599*, was delayed, and thus it was the Mk.V prototype, *HM595*, that would fly first.[18]\n\nOn 2 September 1942, the Tempest Mk.V prototype, *HM595*, conducted its maiden flight, flown by Philip Lucas from Langley, Berkshire, England.[18] *HM595*, which was powered by a Sabre II engine, retained the Typhoon's framed canopy and car-style door, and was fitted with the \"chin\" radiator, similar to that of the Typhoon.[14] It was quickly fitted with the same bubble canopy fitted to Typhoons, and a modified fin that almost doubled the vertical tail surface area, made necessary because the directional stability with the original Typhoon fin had been reduced over that of the Typhoon by the longer nose incurred by the new fuel tank. The horizontal tailplanes and elevators were also increased in span and chord; these were also fitted to late production Typhoons.[14][19] Test pilots found the Tempest a great improvement over the Typhoon in performance; in February 1943 the pilots from the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down reported that they were impressed by \"a manoeuvrable and pleasant aircraft to fly with no major handling faults\".[10]\n\nOn 24 February 1943, the second prototype *HM599* first flew, representing the \"Tempest Mk.I\" equipped with the Napier Sabre IV engine; this flight had been principally delayed by protracted problems and slippages encountered in the development of the new Sabre IV engine.[10] Construction had been on hold (so parts could be used for possible repairs to the first prototype) until *HM595* was converted to Sabre II.[12] *HM599* was at first equipped with the older Typhoon cockpit structure and vertical tailplane. The elimination of the \"chin\" radiator did much to improve overall performance, leading to the Tempest Mk.I quickly becoming the fastest aircraft that Hawker had built at that time, having attained a speed of 466 mph (750 km\/h) during test flights.[20] The Sabre IV was failing testing and so the Mk I Tempest was abandoned by the MAP.[21]\n\nOn 27 November 1944, the Tempest Mk.III prototype, *LA610*, conducted its first flight; it was decided to discontinue development work on the Mk.III, this was due to priority for the Griffon engine having been assigned to the Supermarine Spitfire instead.[13][nb 5] The Air Ministry had seen the Mk III as a replacement for the Hurricane in ground attack, with the narrower engine giving a better view as well but the Typhoon would be the interim aircraft for the role. In practice the Typhoon proved very good for ground attack.[22]\n\nWork on the Tempest Mk.IV variant was abandoned without any prototype being flown at all.[13] The Tempest Mk.II, which was subject to repeated delays due to its Centaurus powerplant, was persisted with, but would not reach production in time to see service during the Second World War.[19] Continual problems with the Sabre IV meant that only the single Tempest Mk.I (*HM599*) was built; consequently, Hawker proceeded to take the Sabre II-equipped \"Tempest V\" into production instead.[23]\n\nIn August 1942, even before the first flight of the prototype Tempest V had been conducted, a production order for 400 Tempests was placed by the Air Ministry.[18][b] This order was split, with the initial batch of 100 being Tempest V \"Series I\"s, powered by the 2,235 hp (1,667 kW) Sabre IIA series engine, which had the distinctive chin radiator, while the rest were to have been produced as the Tempest I, equipped with the Sabre IV and leading-edge radiators. These 300 Tempest Is were intended to replace an order for a similar quantity of Typhoons placed with the Gloster Aircraft Company.[18][nb 6] As it transpired, the difficulties with the Sabre IV and the wing radiators led to this version never reaching production, the corresponding order was switched to 300 Tempest V \"Series 2\"s instead.[18][25][nb 7]\n\n### Tempest Mk.V\n\n[edit]During early 1943, a production line for the Tempest Mk.V was established in Hawker's Langley facility, alongside the existing manufacturing line for the Hawker Hurricane.[19] Production was initially slow, claimed to be due to issues encountered with the rear spar. On 21 June 1943, the first production Tempest V, *JN729*, rolled off the production line[19][23] and its maiden flight was conducted by test pilot Bill Humble.[27]\n\nDuring production of the first batch of 100 Tempest V \"Series Is\", distinguishable by their serial number prefix *JN*, several improvements were progressively introduced and were used from the outset on all succeeding Tempest V \"Series 2s\", with serial number prefixes EJ, NV and SN. The fuselage\/empennage joint originally featured 20 external reinforcing \"fishplates\", similar to those fitted to the Typhoon, but it was not long before the rear fuselage was strengthened and, with the fishplates no longer being needed, the rear fuselage became detachable.[28] The first series of Tempest Vs used a built-up rear spar pick-up\/bulkhead assembly (just behind the cockpit) which was adapted from the Typhoon. Small blisters on the upper rear wing root fairing covered the securing bolts. This was later changed to a new forged, lightweight assembly which connected to new spar booms: the upper wing root blisters were replaced by small \"teardrop\" fairings under the wings.[28]\n\nThe first 100 Tempest Vs were fitted with 20 mm (0.79 in) Hispano Mk.II cannon with long barrels which projected ahead of the wing leading edges and were covered by short fairings; later production Tempest Vs switched to the short-barrelled Hispano Mk.Vs, with muzzles flush with the leading edges.[25] Early Tempest Vs used Typhoon-style 34 by 11 in (86 by 28 cm) five-spoke wheels, but most had smaller 30 by 9 in (76 by 23 cm) four-spoke wheels.[29] The new spar structure of the Tempest V also allowed up to 2,000 lb (910 kg) of external stores to be carried underneath the wings.[23] As a result, several early production Tempest V aircraft underwent extensive service trials at Boscombe Down for clearance to be fitted with external stores, such as one 250\u20131,000 lb (110\u2013450 kg) bomb or eight \"60lb\" air-to-ground RP-3 rockets under each wing. On 8 April 1944, the Tempest Mk.V attained general clearance[30] to carry such ordnance, but few Tempest Mk.V deployed bombs operationally during the war.[19][31] Rockets were never used operationally during the war by the Mk.Vs.[32]\n\nAs in all mass-produced aircraft, there may have been some overlap of these features as new components became available. In mid-to-late 1944 other features were introduced to both the Typhoon and Tempest: A *Rebecca* transponder unit was fitted, with the associated aerial appearing under the portside centre section. A small, elongated oval static port appeared on the rear starboard fuselage, just above the red centre spot of the RAF roundel. This was apparently used to measure the aircraft's altitude more accurately.[ citation needed]\n\nUnusually, in spite of the Tempest V being the RAF's best low- to medium-altitude fighter, it was not equipped with the new Mk.IIC gyroscopic gunsight (as fitted in RAF Spitfires and Mustangs from mid-1944), which would have considerably improved the chances of shooting down opposing aircraft. Tempest pilots continued to use either the Type I Mk.III reflector gunsight, which projected the sighting graticule directly onto the windscreen, or the Mk.IIL until just after the Second World War, when the gyro gunsight was introduced in Tempest IIs.[33]\n\nTwo Tempest Vs, *EJ518* and *NV768*, were fitted with Napier Sabre Vs and experimented with several different Napier-made annular radiators, with which they resembled Tempest IIs. This configuration proved to generate less drag than the standard \"chin\" radiator, contributing to an improvement in the maximum speed of some 11 to 14 mph.[34] *NV768* was later fitted with a ducted spinner, similar to that fitted to the Fw 190 V1.[20][35]\n\n#### 47 mm anti tank gun trials\n\n[edit]Tempest V *SN354* was fitted with two experimental underwing Class P 47 mm guns (built by Vickers) just after the war.[36][37][c] These guns were part of a project started in mid-1942 to develop a more powerful airborne anti-tank gun than the Vickers 40 mm Class S gun which had been used on the Hurricane IID.[36][d] The Vickers guns were housed in long slim streamlined gun pods carried on the bomb racks[32] and had 38 rounds each.[39] Surviving photographs suggests that the 20 mm wing guns were removed for this installation. Testing of the guns revealed that the weapon had potential, but no production was undertaken.[32]\n\n### Tempest Mk.II\n\n[edit]As a result of the termination of the Tornado project, Sydney Camm and his design team transferred the alternative engine proposals for the Tornado to the more advanced Tempest.[15] Thus, it was designed from the outset to use the Bristol Centaurus 18 cylinder radial engine as an alternative to the liquid cooled engines which were also proposed. A pair of Centaurus-powered Tempest II prototypes were completed.[40] Apart from the new engine and cowling, the Tempest II prototypes were similar to early series Tempest Vs. The Centaurus engine was closely cowled and the exhaust stacks grouped behind and to either side of the engine: to the rear were air outlets with automatic sliding \"gills\". The carburettor air intakes were in the inner leading edges of both wings, an oil cooler and air intake were present in the inner starboard wing. The engine installation owed much to examinations of a captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and was clean and effective.\n\nOn 28 June 1943, the first Tempest II, *LA602*, flew powered by a Centaurus IV (2,520 hp\/1,879 kW) driving a four-blade propeller. *LA602* initially flew with a Typhoon-type fin and rudder unit. This was followed by the second, *LA607*, which was completed with the enlarged dorsal fin and first flew on 18 September 1943: *LA607* was assigned to engine development.[41][nb 8] The first major problem experienced during the first few flights was serious engine vibrations, which were cured by replacing the rigid, eight-point engine mountings with six-point rubber-packed shock mounts. In a further attempt to alleviate engine vibration, the four-blade propeller was replaced with a five-blade unit; eventually, a finely balanced four bladed unit was settled on.[42][43] Problems were also experienced with engine overheating, poor crankshaft lubrication, exhaust malfunctions and reduction-gear seizures. Because of these problems, and because of the decision to \"tropicalise\" all Tempest IIs for service in the South-East Asian theatre, production was delayed.[41][44]\n\nOrders had been placed as early as September 1942 for 500 Tempest IIs to be built by Gloster but in 1943, because of priority being given to the Typhoon, a production contract of 330 Tempest IIs was allocated instead to Bristol, while Hawke\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step 1 \u2014 mid\u201119th century balloon carrier: SMS Vulcano launched incendiary balloons against Venice in 1849 (first combat use of balloon weapons).

Many long-distance HVDC systems use sea or ground return for the DC neutral current since this is considerably cheaper than providing a dedicated *metallic return* conductor on an overhead wire or cable. The ground electrode is separated from the converter station so that current returning through the ground electrode does not cause corrosion of parts of the station in contact with the earth.\n\n## Ground connection\n\n[edit]The connection to ground requires a specially designed *ground electrode* (or *earth electrode*).[1][2] The electrode is usually located several tens of kilometres from the converter station in order to avoid possible problems or corrosion in the converter station grounding system. [3] The **electrode line** connects the converter station to the grounding electrode. The electrode line can be implemented, depending upon the location of the electrode (onshore or in the sea), as ground cables, as overhead line, or as a combination of ground cable and overhead line.\n\n## Bipolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are used in most bipolar thyristor-based line-commutated converter (LCC) HVDC transmission systems as a means to improve the reliability of the entire system while also reducing the DC voltage and current ripples. In the event that one of the poles in the bipolar system is faulted, the current path will switch to ground return, thus allowing the system to continue operating at reduced capacity and reducing the possibility that a pole fault will cause a bipolar outage. Usually these ground return paths are only used for very short durations until the faulted pole can be returned to service. The ground current in such schemes can flow in either direction, so the electrodes have to be designed to be reversible, operating either as an anode or cathode. Concerning voltage-source-converter (VSC) HVDC systems, the main reason to use bipolar configurations, especially when the pole-to-pole DC voltages approach 1 MV, is because when one line is faulted in a monopolar HVDC system, the AC phase-to-ground voltages experience peak voltages twice that of normal operation, calling for double the galvanic isolation that is need for normal operation.\n\n## Monopolar systems\n\n[edit]HVDC electrodes are also used in some monopolar HVDC systems, for example the Italy\u2013Corsica\u2013Sardinia scheme.[4] In such systems the electrode line permanently carries the same current as the high-voltage conductor; however since the ground current is then only unidirectional, one of the electrodes (the cathode) can be of simpler design since corrosion is not a problem for cathode electrodes.\n\n## Typical voltages\n\n[edit]The operating voltage of the electrode line usually is in the range of approx. 10-20kV (medium voltage range).[5]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**Arrillaga, Jos; High Voltage Direct Current Transmission, second edition, Institution of Electrical Engineers, ISBN 0 85296 941 4, 1998, pp190\u2013192.**^**Kimbark, E.W., Direct current transmission, volume 1, Wiley Interscience, 1971, chapter 9.**^**M.V.Bakshi U.A.Bakshi,*Elements Of Power Systems*, Technical Publications, 2009, ISBN 8184312679 page 12-26**^**Compendium of HVDC schemes, CIGR\u00c9 Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987.**^**Padiyar, K.

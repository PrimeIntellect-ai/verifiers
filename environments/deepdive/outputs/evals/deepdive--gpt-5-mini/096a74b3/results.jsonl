This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city. This political figure initially entered the national legislative body following a nationwide electoral contest, which distinctively integrated, for the first time, elected officials from several newly acquired territories.

Short answer: I could not find a 2014 traditional\u2011Chinese\u2011medicine journal paper that (a) investigates the mechanisms of lung cancer using computational methods (network pharmacology \/ pathway or gene\u2011expression analysis), (b) explicitly captures a senior practitioner\u2019s understanding, and (c) lists only collaborators affiliated with Beijing University of Chinese Medicine.\n\nWhat I searched and what I found\n- I searched broadly (English and Chinese sources, CNKI\/Wanfang\u2013style queries through web search) for 2014 TCM\u2011journal papers about lung cancer using computational\/network\u2011pharmacology methods. These kinds of computational TCM studies on lung cancer are much more common from ~2015 onward; I did not find a clear match in 2014.\n- A general 2014 review useful for context (but not the lung\u2011cancer original research you asked for) is:\n  - Li S., Zhang B., Jiang D., Wei Y., Zhang N., \u201cNetwork pharmacology in traditional Chinese medicine,\u201d Evidence\u2011Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, 2014.

Some older Chinese articles and some TCM lung\u2011cancer mechanism PDFs surfaced, but none matched all the constraints you gave (2014 + computational methods + exclusive Beijing University of Chinese Medicine authorship + the specific collaborator history).\n- If you want me to continue, I can:\n  1) Search CNKI and Wanfang directly with focused Chinese keywords and extract author affiliation blocks for 2013\u20132016 (this often finds Chinese\u2011only papers that general web search misses).  \n  2) Perform targeted searches for likely author names (in Chinese) across the publication timeframe you specified. If you can provide any likely Chinese name(s), even partial, that will speed things greatly.  \n  3) Check Beijing University of Chinese Medicine\u2019s faculty publication lists or institutional repository for 2014 lung cancer \/ \u7f51\u7edc\u836f\u7406\u5b66 \/ \u7f51\u7edc\u836f\u7406 \/ \u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66 publications.\n\nTell me if you\u2019d like me to continue (and whether you can add any small extra clues: a Chinese author name, a word from the title, or the journal name).

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties. It introduces a comprehensive method for evaluating these dangers, incorporating probabilistic modelling for fluctuating elements like electric vehicle charging patterns and renewable energy outputs. The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

The authoritative bibliographic record most consistently points to a conference contribution around 1987 with the author group Jourdan \/ Alexandre \/ Dubon\u2011Chevallier \/ Dangla \/ Gao.\n- I did not find distinct, separate journal papers in 1985\u20131987 by those three authors on the exact topic beyond the conference\/MBE proceedings entries cited above; a fuller check of IEEE Xplore, INSPEC, conference proceedings (European MBE 1987) or contacting DTIC\/archives will likely provide the exact year\/page citation and any additional coauthors.\n\nIf you want, I can: (a) try to retrieve the DTIC\/MBE proceedings PDF (requires access), (b) search IEEE Xplore \/ Web of Science for the exact conference year\/page, or (c) prepare exact citation records to request from a library.\n\n--- Response 4 ---\n\nI could not retrieve full bibliographic details for specific CNET conference papers from 1986\u20131988 within the available search results. What I did confirm from the sources accessible is:\n\n- CNET (especially the Bagneux centre) was actively working on heterojunction bipolar transistors (TBH\/HBT) in the mid\u20111980s, and published\/communicated results on GaAs\/AlGaAs TBH digital circuit blocks (example: a divide\u2011by\u2011two circuit) around 1986.

Dangla active in 1986\u20131987 semiconductor\/device meetings and short publications:\n  - 17th ESSDERC (1987) appears in conference records listing J. Dangla (DTIC entry references J. Dangla, M. Laporte, P.-Y. Merrer, E. Caquot). No page range shown in the DTIC snippet.\n  - References to a 1986 Physics of Semiconductors conference (Stockholm 1986) list a contribution by J. Dangla, C. Dubon-Chevallier and D. Ankri (\u201cObservation of Bloch Conduction \u2026\u201d) \u2014 cited as a conference contribution in later literature.\n  - IEEE Electron Device Letters \/ Electronics Letters items (1986\u20131987) cite papers with J. Dangla as co-author (e.g., EDL-7, p.129 (1986); Electronics Letters Aug 1987) \u2014 these are short communications\/journal letters rather than multi-page proceedings.\n  - Workshop\/meeting listings (WOCSDICE, device workshops) and other proceedings bibliographies cite J. Dangla on various short conference contributions and abstracts.\n\nWhat I could NOT confirm from the searches:\n- I did not find a specific proceedings entry authored by J. Dangla dated 1986 or 1987 that shows pages 213\u2013215.\n- I did not find a clear record explicitly tying a 1986\u20131987 J. Dangla conference paper to a West Germany venue in the search results available.\n\nRecommended next steps to locate the exact 3\u2011page \/ pp.213\u2013215 item:\n- Search IEEE Xplore, INSPEC, Web of Science, or Springer proceedings for \u201cDangla\u201d combined with specific conference titles (ESSDERC 1987, Physics of Semiconductors 1986, Transducers\/International Solid\u2011State Sensors & Actuators) and check the printed proceedings table of contents.\n- Check library catalogs or the proceedings volumes for ESSDERC \u201987 (conference program\/indices often list page ranges) and the 1986 Physics of Semiconductors proceedings.\n- If you can provide a full given name, affiliation (e.g., CNET Bagneux, CNRS, or company), or the exact conference title, I can refine the search further.\n\n--- Response 4 ---\n\nI could not confirm or locate a specific 1987 conference proceedings held in West Germany whose pages 213\u2013215 contain a short paper titled (or about) \u201cheterojunction bipolar digital blocks.\u201d My automated searches ran out of tool calls before a definitive match was found.\n\nWhat I did find (possible leads)\n- A DTIC record (ADA313172) referencing proceedings that include Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT) material (link: https:\/\/apps.dtic.mil\/sti\/tr\/pdf\/ADA313172.pdf). The DTIC item appears to be a proceedings-type report that cites HBT papers but does not by itself confirm the exact West Germany 1987 conference or the 213\u2013215 pagination you gave.\n- Several secondary hits and literature that discuss HBTs and integration with digital blocks (journal and thesis references), but none explicitly cite a 1987 West Germany proceedings with pages 213\u2013215.\n\nWhy I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy the request\n- The search quota for external lookups was exhausted during investigation, so I could not query additional bibliographic databases (WorldCat, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, INSPEC, German National Library) or view the full tables of contents of likely 1987 conference volumes.\n- The phrase \u201cheterojunction bipolar digital blocks\u201d is uncommon in bibliographic metadata; the short paper you mention may be indexed under different wording (e.g., \u201cHBT digital circuits\/blocks,\u201d \u201cheterojunction bipolar circuits,\u201d or an author name rather than that phrase).\n\nRecommended next steps I can perform if you\u2019d like me to continue\n1) Query major bibliographic and conference databases (IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, WorldCat, INSPEC, German National Library) for proceedings in FRG (West Germany) 1987 that include HBT\/Heterojunction Bipolar papers and inspect TOCs and page ranges.  \n2) Search library catalogs for conference proceedings held in West Germany in 1987 (cities to check: Munich, Berlin (West), Bonn, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Frankfurt) and then open their tables of contents to check pages 213\u2013215.  \n3) Search by likely author names if you have any (authors often cited in HBT work in the 1980s include names like D. T. (or others); if you can supply an author, I can target the search).  \n4) If you have institutional\/library access, I can provide exact search queries and recommended e-resources to run there (WorldCat local, university library, British Library, Deutsche Nationalbibliothek).\n\nIf you want me to continue, tell me whether you have a preferred database or an author name, or allow me to run more searches (I\u2019ll need additional tool calls).\nDone\n[Execution time: 151.92s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_ItQ4EL8DF7szGfEYkYIEJ3Cs\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Step 2: Prepare current best answer\\\\nanswer_content = (\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Short summary:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"\\\\n    \\\\\\\"I could not find a definitive, verifiable bibliographic entry giving the exact title of a 3\\u2011page (pp.213\\u2013215) 1987 West\\u2011German conference paper that exactly matches your description.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"\\\\n    \\\\\\\"What I did find (high\\u2011confidence leads):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"\\\\n    \\\\\\\"- Authors and affiliation cluster: several short 1986\\u20131987 conference contributions on heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT\/TBH) originate from CNET (Centre National d'Etudes des T\\u00e9l\\u00e9communications, Bagneux \/ France T\\u00e9l\\u00e9com R&D).

It combined a centralized, Islamic administration, a standing army and navy, and active long\u2011distance Indian Ocean commerce. Historians often call it a rare African \u201chydraulic empire.\u201d\\n\\nControl of watercourses and agricultural infrastructure\\n- Monopoly of the Jubba and Shabelle river systems: the Ajuran built and maintained dams, dikes, irrigation channels (locally called kelliyo), large stone wells and cisterns, and a land\u2011measurement system to organize irrigated farms.  \\n- Centralized regulation of wells and water access let the state extract tribute, settle disputes, control pastoral movements, and underpin large-scale riverine agriculture (sorghum, maize, cotton, bananas, etc.).  \\n- This hydraulic control was a major source of revenue and political authority across the riverine interiors and helped sustain caravan and coastal trade.\\n\\nTrade networks and economy\\n- The Ajuran integrated inland production with Indian Ocean and overland trade: coastal entrep\u00f4ts exported ivory, frankincense\/aloes, textiles, ambergris, exotic animals and agricultural produce; they imported cloth, ceramics, spices, firearms and other goods.  \\n- They minted\/localized coinage (Ajuran and earlier Mogadishu issues) and maintained regular maritime links with the Near East, Ottoman\/Turkish actors, Persia, India (Surat, Cambaya), Malacca, the Ming Chinese world, the Swahili coast and, episodically, Portuguese forces.  \\n- Major commercial activities centred on the Benadir ports and the riverine towns that fed them.\\n\\nUrban\/maritime centres and outposts under Ajuran authority (principal towns and ports)\\n- Major coastal ports and cities: Mogadishu, Merca (Marka), Barawa (Brava), Kismayo, Hobyo (Obbia), Warsheikh, Eyl.  \\n- Riverine and interior towns \/ seasonal palaces \/ outposts: Afgooye, Baidoa, Mareeg, Qelafo (in present\u2011day Somali Region, Ethiopia), Gondershe, El Buur, Ras Bar Balla, Hannassa.  \\n- The Ajuran sphere at its height is reported to have extended roughly from Hobyo in the north to Kismayo in the south and westward toward Qelafo, encompassing the Jubba\u2013Shabelle valleys and many satellite settlements that functioned as agricultural or caravan outposts.\\n\\nMilitary and political notes\\n- The Ajuran had a professional army (including recruits drawn beyond clan loyalties), fortifications, and a navy to protect coastal trade; by the 16th century they used firearms (via Ottoman and Indian Ocean connections). They resisted Oromo expansions and fought Portuguese incursions (famous clashes at Barawa and threats to Mogadishu).  \\n- Administration combined religious authority (Imam) with emirs, na\u2019ibs (viceroys), wazirs (tax officials) and qadis (judges).\\n\\nSuccessor states \/ breakaways \u2014 notable military commanders or leaders who split from Ajuran rule\\n- Ibrahim Adeer (Ibrahim Adeer\/Gobroon): a former Ajuran general who defeated Ajuran vassals (the Silcis) in the late 17th century and founded the Gobroon (Geledi) dynasty \/ Sultanate of the Geledi (capital Afgooye). The Geledi became the most important successor power in the Jubba\u2013Shabelle region.  \\n- The Hiraab (Yacquubi) Imamate: born of a popular\/clan revolt against Ajuran abuses in the late 17th century; an indigenous Hiraab leader commonly named Imam Omar (leader of the Darandoolle\/Hiraab coalition in oral traditions) established the Hiraab Imamate with Mogadishu as its centre. (In short: Hiraab leaders who rebelled against Ajuran rule became founders of a lasting successor polity.)\\n\\nLegacy and decline (brief)\\n- Late Ajuran fiscal pressure, alleged abuses of Islamic norms, and loss of coastal cities to rebellious clients contributed to multiple uprisings. By the end of the 17th century the Ajuran polity fragmented into successor sultanates (Geledi, Hiraab Imamate and others), and coastal riverine trade patterns changed accordingly.\\n\\nSources and further reading (select)\\n- Modern surveys and encyclopedias (e.g., Britannica), and detailed accounts in secondary literature and local chronicles discuss Ajuran hydraulic works, trade, coinage and the rise of the Geledi and Hiraab polities after Ajuran decline.', '\\\\text{Town: Afgooye. \\\\quad Datum\/System: WGS 84 (commonly WGS84 \/ UTM zone 38N). \\\\quad Ellipsoid: WGS84 ellipsoid (a=6378137.0 m, 1\/f=298.257223563).}']\n[Execution time: 239.21s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_VVDgfEFiJ87Bi2g77kEdPjWw\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"answer['content'] = \\\\\\\"The WGS84 ellipsoid (World Geodetic System 1984) \\u2014 semi-major axis a = 6,378,137.0 m, inverse flattening 1\/f = 298.257223563.\\\\\\\"\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"My answer: {answer['content']}\\\\\\\")\\\\nanswer['ready'] = True\\\\n\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"My answer: The WGS84 ellipsoid (World Geodetic System 1984) \u2014 semi-major axis a = 6,378,137.0 m, inverse flattening 1\/f = 298.257223563.\n[Execution time: 104.27s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Answer: The WGS84 ellipsoid (World Geodetic System 1984), with semi-major axis a = 6,378,137.0 m and inverse flattening 1\/f = 298.257223563.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":0.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":467582.1490287781,"scoring_ms":452.7359008789,"total_ms":468034.884929657,"info":{"raw_question":"Begin with an East African nation whose demographic study lists various kin-based societal units; one such unit, a significant part of a larger patrilineal group, is explicitly mentioned.

It emphasizes key profibrogenic growth factors and cytokines\u2014notably platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) as a potent mitogen driving proliferation and migration, and transforming growth factor\u2011\u03b21 (TGF\u2011\u03b21) as the principal inducer of collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix accumulation\u2014along with inflammatory cytokines from Kupffer cells (TNF\u2011\u03b1, IL\u20111, IL\u20116) and alcohol-related mediators (acetaldehyde, lipid peroxides, hypoxia). The review highlights intracellular signaling cascades implicated in stellate cell activation: receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream MAP kinase pathways (ERK\/MAPK, JNK, p38), PI3K\/Akt signaling, protein kinase C, non\u2011receptor tyrosine kinases, and TGF\u2011\u03b2\/Smad signaling, together with oxidative stress\u2013linked pathways that promote proliferation, migration, contractility and increased ECM production.', 'Nancy C.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

Each sub-LLM has access to web search tools (search, open) and can:\n   - Search for relevant information\n   - Open promising results to read full content\n   - Extract and summarize key facts\n\n3. **Synthesize findings**: After collecting sub-LLM responses, combine and cross-reference their findings. Look for:\n   - Consistent facts across sources (high confidence)\n   - Contradictions that need resolution\n   - Gaps that require follow-up research\n\n4. **Iterate if needed**: If the initial research reveals new questions or missing information, dispatch another batch of targeted sub-tasks. Repeat until you have sufficient evidence.\n\n5. **Finalize**: Write your synthesized answer to `answer[\"content\"]`, verify it addresses the original question, then set `answer[\"ready\"] = True`.\n\nKey insight: Sub-LLMs handle the verbose web content, returning concise summaries.

The name\\'s etymology is contested (Somali, Sidamo, and Oromo-language explanations exist), but in many accounts Galla was used to mean outsiders\/strangers or \"wanderers\" and became a pejorative label. After periods of marginalization and pressure from highland\/chieftain authorities (Amhara\/Christian highland polities), Oromo society \u2014 organized by the Gadaa system \u2014 developed strong military capacity and in the 16th century mounted large-scale expansions and raids that altered the political map of the Horn of Africa. Key facts and sources: \\n\\n- Name \/ meaning:\\n  - \"Galla\" is an older exonym for the Oromo; meanings cited include \"wanderers,\" \"strangers,\" or (in Somali contexts) non\u2011Muslims\/infidels. The etymology is debated and disputed by scholars. \\n    - Journal of Oromo Studies (Vol. 17, 2010) \u2014 detailed discussion of the origin(s) and meanings of \"Galla\" and its reformulation in Ethiopian sources: https:\/\/oromostudies.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/jos\/JOS-Volume-17-Number-1-2010.pdf\\n    - Encyclopaedia Aethiopica summary (excerpt): discussion of Galla as an outdated\/pejorative term and its semantic history: https:\/\/en.sewasew.com\/p\/galla-(%E1%8C%8B%E1%88%8B)\\n    - Dictionary entry showing historical use of \"Galla\" for Oromo: https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/galla\\n\\n- Oppression \/ chiefly\/highland domination:\\n  - Highland (Abyssinian\/Amhara) polities and officials historically treated Oromo as outsiders\/tenants and imposed Amharization and restrictions; the label \"Galla\" was used by highland elites and carried discriminatory connotations in many accounts (see Encyclopaedia Aethiopica summary above).\\n\\n- Militarization and later reputation for military skill:\\n  - Oromo political-military organization (Gadaa system) and social institutions enabled mobilization; during the 16th century Oromo migrations\/expansions they proved militarily effective, raiding and overrunning parts of the Ethiopian highlands and establishing new polities.

The Xhosa-derived name Mfengu was traditionally explained from an old Xhosa root meaning \u201cto wander,\u201d hence the frequent English label \u201cthe wanderers.\u201d\\n\\n- Origins and early history: In the 19th century they are said to have formed from clans dispersed during the Mfecane\/Mfecane-era upheavals and to have settled among Xhosa peoples. (Some modern scholars caution that this \u201crefugee\u201d origin and the boundaries of a distinct Fengu ethnicity were also shaped by colonial\/missionary narratives.)\\n\\n- Oppression by Xhosa chiefs: After settling among Xhosa groups the Fengu suffered discrimination and pressure from dominant Xhosa factions (notably the Gcaleka), who reportedly treated them poorly (epithets such as \u201cdogs\u201d are recorded in older accounts). Seeking protection from oppression, many Fengu entered into an alliance with the Cape colonial authorities in 1835 (the \u201cFingo oath\u201d at Peddie) and accepted British protection and land (later called Fingoland).\\n\\n- Alliance with the Cape and economic change: Under missionary influence they adopted Christianity, agriculture (ploughs), schooling and urban trades; they did not participate in the 1856\u201358 Xhosa cattle\u2011killing and were able to buy and resell cattle and expand economically, increasing their prestige and differences with some Xhosa groups.\\n\\n- Military reputation: The Fengu gained a strong reputation as reliable colonial allies and skilled levies\/commandos. Fengu fighters served as irregular levies in the Cape frontier wars and later colonial campaigns; leaders such as Veldtman Bikitsha became noted for their military leadership (notably in the 1877 Frontier War). Fengu levies were also recruited into colonial forces (sometimes called \u201cCape Boys\u201d) in later campaigns (including in Rhodesia).

See Wikipedia summary: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PICkit\n\n2) Did the first PICkit or other Microchip programmers use serial\/parallel PC ports?\n- PICkit 1 and PICkit 2 were USB devices. PICkit 1 is a USB starter kit; PICkit 2 uses full\u2011speed USB 2.0. (See PICkit 1 and PICkit 2 docs above.)\n  Sources: PICkit 1 UG: https:\/\/ww1.microchip.com\/downloads\/en\/devicedoc\/40051c.pdf ; PICkit 2 press release: https:\/\/ww1.microchip.com\/downloads\/pr_archive\/en\/en023862.pdf\n\n- Older Microchip programmers\/development kits (pre\u2011PICkit era) did use legacy PC ports:\n  - PICSTART \/ PICSTART Plus and some older Microchip programming tools used RS\u2011232 serial connections (the PICSTART Plus is a well\u2011known serial\u2011port programmer). (Microchip product docs \/ historical references.)  \n    Example reference (usage notes): https:\/\/ibex.tech\/resources\/guides\/customer-guides\/manufacturing\/programming-using-the-microchip-picstart-programmer\n  - Some development\/evaluation kits used the PC parallel (LPT\/DB25) port for host I\/O (example: the MCP2515 dev kit\u2019s host connection is via a DB25 parallel cable \/ LPT).

Note: Microchip later announced that MPLAB X IDE v6.25 (and later) discontinues support for Gen\u20113 tools (PICkit 3, ICD 3, REAL ICE).

PICkit 2 is now an obsolete tool and Microchip no longer actively supports it; community\/third\u2011party software (and some legacy MPLAB\/X setups) can still make PICkit 2 usable, but it is not recommended for current MPLAB X development.

Parliamentary representation for national minorities is organised through a special (national) electoral constituency (District XII) that elects reserved minority MPs (eight seats in total); Slovenians are represented within that minority constituency (they are allocated a seat as part of the smaller\u2011minority groupings). \n\nSources: Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities (summary) \u2014 https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Constitutional_Act_on_the_Rights_of_National_Minorities_in_the_Republic_of_Croatia; European Parliament factsheet on the Croatian Parliament (explaining the special minority constituency and eight reserved seats) \u2014 https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/cmsdata\/291062\/Factsheet%20HR%20sabor%2014112024.pdf\n---\nBrief answer\n- Who they are: The Porabje (R\u00e1ba) Slovenes are ethnic Slovenes (a Slovene-speaking community) who live in the R\u00e1ba\/Porabje region of western Hungary.

Epub 2013 Apr 6. PMID: 23570738\n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and effects of single-incision laparoscopic anterior resection (SILAR) for sigmoid colon cancer by comparing it with conventional laparoscopic anterior resection (CLAR).\n\nMETHODS: Twenty-four patients who underwent SILAR between April 2010 and July 2011 were case matched 1:2 with patients who underwent CLAR, with respect to age, sex, body mass index, tumor location, and history of abdominal surgery.\n\nRESULTS: Two patients in the SILAR group and 1 patient in the CLAR group experienced anastomotic leakage. The operative time was longer in the SILAR group than in the CLAR group (251 \u00b1 50 vs 237 \u00b1 49 minutes; P = .253). The number of harvested lymph nodes (19.6 \u00b1 10.7 vs 20.8 \u00b1 7.7; P = .630) was not different. The postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the SILAR group (7.1 \u00b1 3.4 days) than in the CLAR group (8.1 \u00b1 3.5 days) (P = .234).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the early outcomes, we conclude that SILAR is feasible and safe. Moreover, the adequate lymph node harvest and free margins support the use of this procedure.\n\nStudy dates and site (confirmed from the article):\n- Study period\/dates: April 2010 to July 2011 (patients who underwent SILAR during this period).\n- Study site\/hospital: Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea (Department of Surgery).\n\n----\n\nSingle incision vs conventional laparoscopic anterior resection for sigmoid colon cancer: a case-matched study.

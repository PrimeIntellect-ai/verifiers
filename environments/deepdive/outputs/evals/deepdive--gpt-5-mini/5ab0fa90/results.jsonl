However, uncertainty exists regarding the factors necessary to stimulate use. We draw on in-depth interviews with local industry, agency, community, and tribal representatives from 10 study sites on federal public lands across the United States to examine persistent conventional wisdoms about what hinders biomass use. Findings indicate that the conventional wisdoms were reasonably accurate although the degree to which each impeded progress varied. Their interconnectedness also varied depending on local conditions. Supply guarantees, industry presence, transportation, and the value of the biomass were limiting factors to use, whereas agency budgets and staffing, environmental concerns, and partnerships more aggravated the problem than impeded progress. Understanding the scope and consistency of these accepted truths is important for ensuring that management efforts and ensuing policy effectively targets local use challenges.']\n[Execution time: 60.16s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_QeSmsUQgtx1bFZBncw0Yjl7Y\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"answer[\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\"] = \\\\\\\"Conventional Wisdoms of Woody Biomass Utilization on Federal Public Lands\\\\\\\"\\\\nprint(f\\\\\\\"My answer: {answer['content']}\\\\\\\")\\\\nanswer['ready'] = True\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"My answer: Conventional Wisdoms of Woody Biomass Utilization on Federal Public Lands\n[Execution time: 0.71s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Conventional Wisdoms of Woody Biomass Utilization on Federal Public Lands","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":727736.4430427551,"scoring_ms":418.0631637573,"total_ms":728154.5062065125,"info":{"raw_question":"In the early 2010s, a pressing need arose to address wildfire risk and promote renewable energy using materials from federal forests.

His work involves examining the standing of such groups, for instance, in a South Asian country where legal codes concerning them stem from a colonial past. That jurisdiction's primary legal framework for offenses, a legacy of its former administrators, was later amended. This amendment was part of a governmental era dedicated to integrating religious tenets into the state's laws. Such integration reportedly heightened friction between two major denominations of a global faith within that territory.

His research portfolio includes detailed simulations leveraging various bead-spring and bead-rod models, deciphering polymer effects in turbulent flows, understanding fluid permeation through fibrous materials relevant to composite manufacturing (collaborating with experts in that field), and examining instabilities at the interface of flowing polymer layers.\n\nIdentify the precise title of this initial paper analyzing the melt's journey through the specific flow setup."},"answer":"Processing\u2013property Interactions in Poly(vinylidene Fluoride).

Below is a concise synthesis and a question about whether to continue the last item.\n\nFindings so far\n- First tolled (partially tolled \/ HOT-type) lanes in the western U.S.\n  - Project: SR\u201191 Express Lanes (91 Express Lanes), Orange County, California.\n  - Opened: December 27, 1995.\n  - Initial private operator: California Private Transportation Company (CPTC), a consortium made up of subsidiaries of Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc. (Kiewit), Cofiroute (French toll\u2011road operator), and Granite Construction.\n  - Source summary: project histories and transportation reports; OCTA later documents.\n\n- Who owns\/operates those lanes now\n  - The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) purchased the franchise\/operating interest (early 2000s, reported ~2003) and now owns\/operates the 91 Express Lanes.\n  - Sources: OCTA and project histories \/ FHWA summaries.\n\n- The state partner agency (franchise partner) and its 19th\u2011century predecessor\n  - State partner agency: California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).\n  - Caltrans traces its organizational predecessors to a late\u201119th\u2011century Bureau of Highways (created by statute in 1895) and to an 1897 Department of Highways; Caltrans was formed as a department in 1973 consolidating earlier highway divisions.\n  - Sources: Caltrans official history pages and California highway history summaries.\n\n- The state highway route, summit, and amphibian contest locale\n  - Route: California State Route 4 (SR 4) is a signed state route with documented legislative origins (Legislative Route Numbers \/ 1934 sign route history and later legislative descriptions).\n  - Summit: Ebbetts Pass (in the Sierra Nevada near SR 4), elevation roughly 8,700\u20138,730 ft \u2014 commonly closed in winter.\n  - Nearby locale with amphibian contest: Angels Camp, California \u2014 host of the Calaveras County Jumping Frog Jubilee (a famous frog\u2011jumping\/amphibian contest).\n  - Sources: SR 4 route documentation, Ebbetts Pass pages, Angels Camp \/ Calaveras County Jumping Frog Jubilee descriptions.\n\nOutstanding item (needs more targeted historical research)\n- Early military leader from the same state who proposed a harbor\u2011defense plan involving rotating turrets, and the eastern metropolitan district where he later died:\n  - I have not yet identified a clear match who is both (a) an early California military leader who proposed a rotating\u2011turret harbor defense for San Francisco (or similar) and (b) has a recorded death specifically stated in an eastern metropolitan district (borough\/district).\n  - Related findings: revolving\/rotating turrets for coastal defense are historically associated with inventors and engineers such as John Ericsson (credited with revolving gun\u2011turret designs used in ironclads and coastal batteries) and Theodore R. Timby (inventor of a revolving turret concept). John Ericsson died in New York City (Manhattan). But I did not find an unequivocal \u201cCalifornia military leader\u201d credited with that specific proposal in the sources I searched.\n  - Sources\/references I checked or flagged for deeper follow-up: National Park Service on San Francisco harbor defenses, congressional records discussing revolving\u2011turret proposals for the Golden Gate, Coast Artillery \/ Army engineer historical reports, and period inventors\u2019 biographies.\n\nWould you like me to continue?\n- I can continue a deeper, focused historical search for the military leader you mention. Recommended next steps (I can run these if you want me to continue):\n  - Search 1860s\u20131890s California newspapers and Army Corps of Engineers \/ Coast Artillery reports for proposals for revolving turrets at the Golden Gate.\n  - Search biographies and obituaries of military officers stationed\/associated with California coastal defense boards for references to rotating\u2011turret proposals and recorded death places (including borough\/district in eastern U.S. cities).\n  - Check patent histories and congressional testimony for named officers who advocated specific harbor defense plans.\n\nIf you want me to proceed, say \u201cPlease continue\u201d (and I\u2019ll run the focused historical searches). If you prefer, I can instead expand any of the confirmed pieces (more precise citations\/URLs for CPTC consortium members, the OCTA purchase record, Caltrans legislative citations, SR\u20114 legislative origin documentation, or sources about Ebbetts Pass and Angels Camp).","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":1421998.8129138947,"scoring_ms":437.784910202,"total_ms":1422436.5978240967,"info":{"raw_question":"A southern capital's ring road uses interchanges.

To comprehensively determine the risk level, an operational risk assessment method considering multiple risk factors is proposed. Firstly, probabilistic models are established including temporal distributions of electric vehicles and uncertainties of renewable energy. Secondly, a time-sequential security risk assessment method with several security indicators including overvoltage risk, undervoltage risk, line-overload risk and load-loss risk is established using probabilistic load flow and dynamical sensitivity weight analysis method. Thirdly, conditional value at risk model is presented for time-varying economic risk considering line-loss risk and operational profit or loss risk of distributed generations.

To comprehensively determine the risk level, an operational risk assessment method considering multiple risk factors is proposed. Firstly, probabilistic models are established including temporal distributions of electric vehicles and uncertainties of renewable energy. Secondly, a time-sequential security risk assessment method with several security indicators including overvoltage risk, undervoltage risk, line-overload risk and load-loss risk is established using probabilistic load flow and dynamical sensitivity weight analysis method. Thirdly, conditional value at risk model is presented for time-varying economic risk considering line-loss risk and operational profit or loss risk of distributed generations. Finally, a risk early warning standard is proposed to realise the visualisation of risk warning by defining the risk level and risk area. Simulations of different scenarios are conducted on the modified IEEE 34-bus radial test system and the results reveal that the proposed strategy is effective and practical.\\n\\nAffiliations:\\nAffiliation details were not available in the retrieved metadata (the accessible record provided authors, title, date and abstract but did not include institutional affiliation lines).

This research addresses the increasing operational complexities and potential hazards in electrical distribution systems due to various uncertainties.

The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting. Furthermore, it presents a model for time-varying economic risks, including line losses and the profitability of distributed generation, employing conditional value at risk. The study culminates in proposing a standard for visual risk alerts based on defined levels and areas. A notable contributor to this work possesses a remarkably eclectic research background, having previously published studies in seemingly disparate areas like agricultural soil science concerning specific plant interactions, catalytic chemical processes, and certain clinical treatment methodologies.

These works relate to heterojunction bipolar transistor material\/growth and are consistent with the \u201cdigital building block \/ very high\u2011speed\u201d context you described.\n- DTIC proceedings records (notably ADA240913 and ADA212842) list contributions from CNET\/France\u2011T\u00e9l\u00e9com in 1987 and include author names you referenced (Praseuth, Temmar, Dangla in some listings). One DTIC document appears to be a compilation of European MBE\/heterostructure conference material that includes page ranges in the 200s.\n- Attempts to open the DTIC PDF (ADA240913) from the automated tools returned a 403\/blocked response, so I could not extract the table of contents or the exact entry on pages 213\u2013215 from that file.\n\nRelated 1986 work (matching the author\/coauthor clues)\n- Searches found 1986 device\/epitaxy papers involving authors like C. Dubon\u2011Chevallier (often cited with coauthors such as D. Ankri), on superlattice\/vertical transport and heavily\u2011doped contact\/epitaxy topics. These fit your hint about the immediately preceding year\u2019s device\u2011physics work.\n- Several 1986\u20131987 publications by Praseuth and Goldstein are consistently cited in the literature on AlInAs\/InGaAs and related heterostructures for HBTs, which matches the \u201cbipolar devices using heterojunctions\u201d description.\n\nWhy I couldn\u2019t give the exact 1987 conference title yet\n- The strongest lead for a proceedings file that likely contains the pages you mention is DTIC ADA240913, but the automated retrieval was blocked (403) so I couldn\u2019t extract the paper on pp. 213\u2013215.\n- Search results suggest the conference proceedings may be a European MBE \/ heterostructure proceedings that had sessions held in Europe (some listings mention Freising \/ West Germany), but I could not find a public, fully indexed TOC online that lists an exact paper title on pp. 213\u2013215 matching the CNET\/HBT digital building block description.\n- The phrase \u201cdigital building block\u201d may be a paraphrase of the actual paper title (common in technical summaries), so an exact-text search for that phrase may miss a paper whose title uses different terms (e.g., \u201cdigital cell\u201d, \u201clogic gate\u201d, \u201cinverter\u201d, \u201cswitching element\u201d, \u201cHBT gate\u201d etc.).\n\nOptions \/ next steps (choose one)\n1) I can continue automated searching across academic databases (IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, WorldCat, national library catalogs) and publisher archives (Springer, AIP) to try to open the relevant proceedings and extract pp. 213\u2013215. This normally finds proceedings TOCs and exact paper titles but will take more time and may require access to subscription databases.\n\n2) If you can provide or point me to the DTIC ADA240913 PDF (or upload it), I will extract the exact paper on pages 213\u2013215 immediately and return the precise title, authors, affiliations and a short citation.\n\n3) I can broaden the search slightly (expand year range to 1986\u20131988 and page-range tolerance \u00b15 pages, and look for synonyms of \u201cdigital building block\u201d) to catch paraphrased titles and return candidate matches for you to confirm.\n\nIf you\u2019d like me to continue automated searching (option 1) I will proceed. If you can provide the DTIC file or a snippet, option 2 will give the fastest, certain result.

This particular unit is recognized for its historical sultanates and a prominent historical figure who, following a period of banishment, established his own coastal dominion. The principal urban center of this newly formed dominion, an ancient port, is noted to have developed as an outpost concurrently with a neighboring settlement, both under the authority of an earlier, formidable medieval empire. This neighboring settlement, also originating in that historical period, was another territory controlled by this extensive empire, which was distinguished by its management of vital watercourses and its far-reaching trade networks before its power waned, enabling one of its own military commanders to rise to prominence. This commander, having previously served the declining empire, successfully broke away to institute his own dynastic sovereignty. The resultant state governed by this commander's lineage held sway over several areas, including a notable town celebrated for an annual traditional combat festival.

They are largely divided into mitogenic (transforming growth factor-alpha, platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and insulin-like growth factor) and fibrogenic (transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-6) cytokines. In addition to their mitogenic (stimulation of cell proliferation) and fibrogenic (induction of matrix proteins) properties, they are also shown to confer in vitro unique cellular changes known to be the key features of HSC \"activation,\" including loss of vitamin A, stimulation of migration, enhanced cellular contractility, and matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase induction. Potential cellular sources of the cytokines consist of hepatic macrophages, endothelial cells, biliary epithelial cells, lymphocytes, platelets, hepatocytes, and activated HSCs. To better understand the mode of actions and the pathogenetic significance of cytokines\/chemokines involved in \"activation\" of HSCs, the following four questions need to be addressed: (1) What other cytokines are expressed by HSCs to establish critical autocrine stimulation? (2) What are endogenous or exogenous priming factors for HSC stimulation? (3) What is the mechanism of activation for transforming growth factor-beta, the pivotal fibrogenic cytokine? (4) How important are HSC-derived proinflammatory mediators in liver fibrosis? This review will discuss these questions, along with the current understanding of the role of cytokines in HSC activation.\nOut[3]: 'Full citation:\\nTsukamoto H.

This singer's life concluded in another city, which serves as a national capital and rests near a significant highland. This highland, whose name suggests a large, shaggy omnivore and whose main summit's name is used for the whole area, features terminology from a distinct linguistic system. This system, named for its particular interrogative for 'what', is spoken in the capital's nation and shares close traits with the tongue of an adjoining country. The path now leads us to consider people of this adjoining country's ethnicity who form an official minority within the first nation, possessing dedicated parliamentary representation. Continuing along the path, we turn our attention from this general minority to a specific subgroup of the same ethnicity, identified by their origin in a distinct historical region spanning current borders. What self-identifying term, cited from a religious text's foreword composed centuries ago, was used for these people from that trans-border region?\n\n<env_tips>\nStrategy for deep research tasks:\n\n1. **Decompose the question**: Break the main question into multiple smaller, focused research sub-tasks that can be investigated independently.\n\n2. **Parallel sub-LLM research**: Use `llm_batch()` to dispatch these sub-tasks in parallel.

The label parallels \u010cakavian (\u010da) and \u0160tokavian (\u0161to\/\u0161ta). (Britannica; Wikipedia)\n\nWhere it is spoken\n- Primarily in northern and northwestern Croatia (historic Kajkavian core: Hrvatsko Zagorje, Me\u0111imurje, Vara\u017edin, Krapina, \u010cakovec, Koprivnica, Kri\u017eevci, parts of Zagreb). Also Gorski Kotar and several mixed\/transitional zones; small Kajkavian-speaking communities exist historically in Austrian Burgenland and some border areas of Hungary and Romania (Banat). (Wikipedia; Britannica)\n\nGenetic\/typological status and relation to Slovene\n- Kajkavian is part of the South Slavic dialect continuum and is often described as a supradialect or large dialect group of Croatian; its exact status (dialect vs. separate language) is debated among linguists because of its substantial differences from \u0160tokavian-based standard Croatian. (Wikipedia)\n- Geographically and linguistically Kajkavian lies between Slovene and other Croatian dialects; it is especially close to certain Slovene (Pannonian) varieties \u2014 notably Prekmurje and parts of Slovene Styria (Prlekija). In some areas Kajkavian and Prekmurje Slovene are largely mutually intelligible. (Wikipedia; Greenberg\/Brill)\n- Shared features with Slovene (examples):\n  - Similar reflexes of some Proto\u2011Slavic vowels (e.g., nasal *\u01eb \u2192 \/o\/), prothetic v- before vowels in many words, and preservation of certain consonant clusters.\n  - Morphosyntactic parallels: similar diminutive suffixes (-ek, -ec), retention of supine distinct from the infinitive, loss\/recent loss of the aorist, lack of a vocative in many varieties, and similar formation of future with the auxiliary biti + participle in some speech (features also found in Slovene dialects).\n  - Lexical and accentual correspondences and many isoglosses linking Kajkavian to the Pannonian\/slovene area (scholarship frames these as circum\u2011Pannonian correspondences). (Wikipedia; Greenberg\/Brill)\n- Important qualification: many similarities reflect long contact, shared older (Pannonian) developments, and the dialect continuum; not all shared traits imply direct descent from Slovene \u2014 some are parallel innovations or archaisms preserved in both areas. Classification remains complex and debated. (Greenberg\/Brill; Wikipedia)\n\nDegree of mutual intelligibility and sociolinguistic realities\n- Mutual intelligibility is variable: many Kajkavian varieties are only partially intelligible to speakers of standard Croatian (\u0160tokavian) and show closer comprehension with adjacent Slovene dialects (Prekmurje, Styria). Urban speech (e.g., Zagreb) shows extensive mixing with \u0160tokavian (a Kajkavian\u2013\u0160tokavian koine).

Modern scholarship records that the Prekmurje literary\/vernacular tradition was called Vend (or Windisch in German) in various sources. Prekmurje dialect texts (16th\u201318th c. onward) are therefore often described in older titles\/catalogues as written in \"Vend\" (vendski) or \"Windisch\".\n  - Citations: \"Prekmurje Slovene\" (overview) https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prekmurje_Slovene; \"The People of Prekmurje: Slovenes with Subtitles\" (discussion of local self\u2011designation and language labels) https:\/\/journals.lib.washington.edu\/index.php\/ssj\/article\/view\/14775\/12384; Prekmurje grammar discussion (Brill \/ KU paper) https:\/\/kuscholarworks.ku.edu\/bitstreams\/d99e57bb-dd34-40d5-8a71-b78cd8dab2d2\/download\n\n- Appearances in forewords of religious texts (16th\u201318th c.), and whether used as self\u2011identifiers:\n  - External\/official forewords (German\/Hungarian) frequently label the language or people \"Windisch\"\/\"Wendisch\" \u2014 that is an exonym rather than an asserted native ethnonym (see Slavic Review \/ CEU thesis).\n  - In local vernacular religious publications from the Prekmurje area (notably the Protestant and later Catholic devotional and Bible translations), the local idiom is consistently used; scholarship records that local authors\/ printers and later bibliographers referred to that idiom as \"Vend\" or vendski. This means that in practice \"Vend\/vendski\" functions in the local print culture as a label for the language of the intended readers; explicit self\u2011ethnic claims in the (Latin\/German\/Hungarian) forewords are less common and when present often reflect external naming (Windisch) or neutral statements about the language of the book rather than a modern ethnic self\u2011designation.\n  - Key primary example to consult: the Prekmurje New Testament by \u0160tefan (Istv\u00e1n) K\u00fczmics (Nouvi Testament, 1771) \u2014 a canonical Prekmurje religious text produced for the local (Trans\u2011Danubian) Slovene speech community. Scholarship on K\u00fczmics and on Prekmurje print culture treats his work as part of the \"Vend\" literary tradition; whether a given preface uses an explicit self\u2011ethnic formula varies by edition and language of the preface.

Explicit self\u2011ethnic identification in forewords is not plentifully attested in translated or bilingual forewords from the 16th\u201318th c.; when present, eighteenth\u2011century Prekmurje authors\/printers most commonly framed their audience by language\/dialect (the local \"Vend\" speech) rather than by a modern national ethnonym.\n- To establish concrete examples (verbatim preface phrasing) you should consult primary editions\/facsimiles of Prekmurje religious works (e.g., K\u00fczmics 1771 Nouvi Testament) or critical editions and studies that reproduce their prefaces; the secondary sources above point to that literature and locate where \"Vend\"\/\"Windisch\" labels are used. \n\nSelected references (online):\n- Lisjak\u2011Gabrijel\u010di\u010d, L.

This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's. Within this nation's air arm, a specific numerically designated squadron, which had earlier flown other aircraft types against targets such as projectile launch sites, was eventually equipped with this effective fighter.

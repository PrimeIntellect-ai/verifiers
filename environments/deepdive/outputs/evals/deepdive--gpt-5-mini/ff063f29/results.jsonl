This actor, hailing from a region famous for its art and hills, and who garnered an award for a role during a major global conflict, became known for appearing in cinematic works supporting a specific national ideology. These works were part of a comprehensive state-controlled persuasive campaign that utilized diverse means, notably including orchestrated public demonstrations of strength like a significant, mechanized military advance aimed at controlling an East African capital. Following this military operation, a prominent journalist and adherent of the prevailing political doctrine, who had earlier administered a major European capital city and was instrumental in creating legislation for cultural preservation, was chosen as the first leader of the captured African city. This political figure initially entered the national legislative body following a nationwide electoral contest, which distinctively integrated, for the first time, elected officials from several newly acquired territories.

He graduated at *Liceo Torquato Tasso* and attended the Sapienza University of Rome until the 1915, when Italy declared war to the Central Powers. The same year, he left his studies to enlist himself in the Italian Royal Army. Wounded in battle, he obtained a Medal of Military Valor after World War I.[1]\n\nIn 1919, Bottai met Benito Mussolini during a Futurist meeting,[2] and contributed to establish the *Fasci Italiani di Combattimento* (Italian Fasces of Combat). In 1921, Bottai ended his studies at law faculty and became a freemason, member of the *Gran Loggia d'Italia*.[3] At the same time, he also started a journalist career in the *Il Popolo d'Italia*, the newspaper of the recently founded National Fascist Party. During the March on Rome, Bottai was along with Ulisse Igliori and Gino Calza-Bini the head of the Roman *squadrismo*, supporting the Blackshirts' political violence.\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]After the 1921 Italian general election, Bottai was elected in the Chamber of Deputies for the National Blocs. In 1923, he became leader of the intransigent national syndicalist and revolutionary faction of fascism. To support his ideas, Bottai founded *Critica fascista* (*Fascist Critic*), a cultural periodical, co-operating with other left-leaning fascists like Filippo De Pisis, Renato Guttuso, and Mario Mafai.[4] Starting in 1930, he contributed to the political and finance magazine *Lo Stato*.[5]\n\nBottai worked to the Ministry of Corporations, introducing the Labour Charter and planning a Corporative Academic Pole in Pisa, from 1926 to 1932, when he was excluded by Mussolini from the Ministry.[6] In 1933, Bottai established and chaired the National Institute of the Social Security (Italian: *Istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale*, INPS). He was appointed governor of Rome (1935\u20131936) but resigned to fight in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War with the rank of major. On 5 May 1936, Bottai and Pietro Badoglio entered in Addis Abeba, and Bottai was appointed as vice governor. After the war, Bottai returned in Rome to be Education Minister. During his ministry, Bottai proclaimed a law (the Bottai Law) on safeguarding public and cultural heritage and the preservation of natural beauties.[7] He also co-worked with art critics Giulio Carlo Argan and Cesare Brandi to improve the Italian cultural life.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Bottai became more radical and a Germanophile. In 1938, he expressed support to racial laws against Italian Jews, and in 1940 founded *Primato* (*Primacy*), a magazine that supported the Aryan race's supremacy and interventionism in the war.[8][9] Bottai thought that the \"Fascist Revolution\" was incomplete and that what was needed was a return to the original and more \"pure\" fascism.\n\n## World War II\n\n[edit]The Italian intervention in World War II resulted in disaster. The Campaign on the Eastern Front caused the death or the injury of approximately 77,000 soldiers, with more than 39,000 injured. Bottai voted for Mussolini's arrest, which had been proposed by Dino Grandi, on 25 July 1943 after Italy's defeat had become evident. In 1944, the Italian Social Republic condemned Bottai to death, during the Verona trial, but Bottai hid in a Roman convent.[10] In 1944, Bottai enlisted in the French Foreign Legion with the pseudonym **Andrea Battaglia**. He fought in Provence during Operation Dragoon and then in the Western Allied invasion of Germany.\n\n## Later life\n\n[edit]After the war, Bottai remained in France and continued to serve in the Foreign Legion until 1948, when he was discharged. For his role in the final stages of World War II, he got an amnesty for his role in fascism. Returning in Italy in 1953, Bottai founded the periodical *ABC* (not to be confused with the magazine with the same name) and *Il Popolo di Roma*, which was financed by ex-fascist Vittorio Cini, who supported centrist and conservative views. Bottai died in Rome in 1959. At his funeral was Aldo Moro who, like Moro's father, had been Bottai's friend and assistant during his career.[11]\n\n## Bibliography\n\n[edit]*Trade organisation in Italy under the act and regulations on collective relations in connection with employment**Economia fascista*(1930)*Grundprinzipien des korporativen Aufbaus in Italien*(1933)*Esperienza corporativa (1929\u20131935)*(1935)*Corporazioni*(1935)*Scritti giuridici in onore di Santi Romano ...*(1940)*Funzione di Roma nella vita culturale e scientifica della nazione*(1940)*Pagine di critica fascista (1915\u20131926)*(1941, edited by F.

The plot features a cavalry lieutenant, unlucky in love, who redeems himself by battling the \"rebels\" of Tripolitania (modern Libya). The film won the Mussolini Cup at the Venice Film Festival, during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War.\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]Cristiana (Fulvia Lanzi) is seen enjoying herself, dancing and drinking with other men. Lieutenant Mario Ludovici (Antonio Centa) races down a dark road and calls Cristiana from a payphone with a sense of urgency. When she does not answer, he proceeds to her apartment and angrily pounds on the door and rings the bell. He demands a traditional relationship, and leaves when she refuses but tries to seduce him.\n\nMario transfers to a desert fort in Tripolitania, where he replaces a heroic lieutenant who has recently perished in combat against the rebellious natives. Captain Santelia (Fosco Giachetti) distrusts Mario at first as a cowardly playboy. However, after the rebels steal some animals, the two pursue them with a squadron of camel-riding native troops allied to the Italians on a long and panoramic desert trek. Mario becomes ill, but eventually the two officers come to a mutual understanding and Mario disposes of a cigarette case from Cristiana and stops reminiscing of their luxurious memories.\n\nHaving caught up to the rebels at an oasis, a battle ensues; the rebels are defeated but the captain is killed. Meanwhile, Cristiana and a group of other tourists have arrived at the fort. A reconnaissance plane brings news to the fort of the battle and a dead officer, without knowing which officer has perished. This causes Cristiana an anxious night of waiting. The following day Lieutenant Ludovici returns, now in command of the squadron, and elects to remain in Tripolitania. As Cristiana prepares to leave with the tourist group, Mario bids her a final goodbye.\n\n## Production\n\n[edit]The film is based on the novel *L'Escadron blanc* by French writer Joseph Peyr\u00e9, who had a hand in the adaptation of the script to the screen.[1] It was shot at the Cines Studios in Rome.\n\nGenina's noted shots of the Tripolitanian desert were all done on location.[2] For its use of foreign technologies, it has been called the \"first sample of the Americanised technical powers of Italy's huge new cinema city.\"[3]\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]Writing for *Night and Day* in 1937, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, characterizing it as \"odd and refreshing\" for a \"superficially melodramatic film\". Greene claims that the film is \"a very slow picture\", but that in time the audience comes to recognize that \"slowness is a value\", and he describes the photography as \"unsensational and memorable\". Greene also praises the acting of Fulvi\u00e1 Lanzi.[4]\n\nA reviewer from the British Union of Fascists raved that the film \"has all the enduring greatness of simplicity. There is no affection, only a plain recounting of Man's eternal battle with Nature.\"[5]\n\n## Analysis\n\n[edit]Traditionally, the film is divided into three narrative segments in the theme of the Fascist male conversion:[6] \"the bourgeois prologue, the colonialist segment, and the epilogue.\"[7]\n\n*Lo squadrone bianco* has been interpreted as an \"exemplary film\" of the Fascism reinterpretation of pre-Fascist historical narratives for contemporary purposes,[8] i.e. \"expansionist propaganda.\"[9] Others consider it first and foremost an Italian neorealist film, only indirectly nationalistic through its use of patriotic themes.[10]\n\nAs in other Fascist colonial films like *Il cammino degli eroi*, the native \"rebels\" are portrayed as well-armed with European weapons.[11] The film plays down the overwhelming disparities between the Italian and Tripolitanian forces, omitting for example the offensive use of aircraft (in addition to reconnaissance) and the use of gas warfare by the Italians.[12]\n\nOther analyses of the film draw on Gustave Le Bon's theory of crowds (i.e. the native Tripolitanians) and space (i.e. the desert) as \"two interconnected phenomena,\"[13] noting that the natives themselves are \"virtually absent from the screen.\"[7]\n\nGenina was temporarily banned from Italian studios for his work on such imperialist war films, but continued to find work after 1945, in a climate where nearly all Italian filmmakers had collaborated to some degree with the regime.[14]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**Ben-Ghiat, Ruth. 2004.*Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945*.

Its goal was to capture the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, in a show of force for Fascist propaganda. An Italian mechanized column under the command of Pietro Badoglio, Marshal of Italy, advanced from the town of Dessie to take Addis Ababa.[1] The march covered a distance of approximately 200 miles (320 km).\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]During the 3rd of October 1935, elements of the Royal Italian Army (*Regio Esercito*) under General Emilio De Bono (the Commander-in-Chief of all Italian armed forces in East Africa) invaded the Ethiopian Empire from staging areas in the Italian colony of Eritrea on what was known as the \"northern front.\"[2] Forces based in Italian Somaliland under General Rodolfo Graziani invaded Ethiopia on what was known as the \"southern front.\" Ground forces on both fronts were amply supported by the Italian Royal Air Force *(Regia Aeronautica*).[ citation needed]\n\nBadoglio replaced De Bono in late 1935 and was immediately faced with the Ethiopian \"Christmas Offensive.\" On 26 December, Badoglio asked for and was permitted to use mustard gas and phosgene. The Italians delivered the poison gas by special artillery canisters and with bombers of the Italian Royal Air Force. While the poorly equipped Ethiopians experienced some success against the more modern weaponry of the Italians, they were not equipped to handle, or experienced in dealing with the \"terrible rain that burned and killed.\"[3]\n\nFrom early 1936, events on the field of battle did not go well for the Imperial Ethiopian Army. On the southern front, Graziani eliminated a large Ethiopian army commanded by Duke (*Ras*) Desta Damtew during the Battle of Ganale Doria using poison gas. Badoglio used poison gas to eliminate many of the Ethiopian northern armies. He destroyed *Ras* Mulugeta Yeggazu's army in the Battle of Amba Aradam. He destroyed *Ras* Kassa Haile Darge's army in the Second Battle of Tembien. Finally, he destroyed *Ras* Imru Haile Sellassie's army in the Battle of Shire.[4]\n\nBy 31 March, the last Ethiopian army on the northern front was commanded in battle by the Emperor himself, Haile Selassie. His army included six battalions of Ethiopia's best troops, the Imperial Guard (*Kebur Zabangna*). The Emperor led an ill-fated counterattack during the Battle of Maychew of which he had little to no chance of victory. The Emperor's army suffered heavy losses during costly frontal assaults on prepared Italian fortifications, but the bulk of his army was destroyed during the days following the battle, when poison gas was again used to decimate the withdrawing columns.[5]\n\nOn 20 April, Marshal Badoglio flew to the town of Dessie in Wollo Province and made his headquarters there. He decided to advance from Dessie and take the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. Dessie is only two-hundred miles (320 km)[6] from Addis Ababa. Except for a procession of refugees, the road to the capital was clear. The Italian Commander-in-Chief faced no substantial Ethiopian resistance.[7]\n\n## Mechanized column\n\n[edit]Because of the lack of resistance between Dessie and Addis Ababa, Badoglio risked a spectacular advance with a \"mechanized column\" for propaganda purposes. In 1936, \"mechanized\" meant infantry transported in a variety of commercial cars and trucks. \"Motorized infantry\" is a more appropriate term for Badoglio's column.[7]\n\nThanks to the organizational genius of a Quartermaster-General Fidenzio Dall'Ora, Badoglio's \"mechanized column\" came together in Dessie between 21 and 25 April. Dall'Ora was able to organize the most powerful \"mechanized\" column to appear on an African road up to that time. In addition to 12,500 Italian troops, the column included 1,785 cars and trucks of all makes (Fiats, Lancias, Alfa-Romeos, Fords, Chevrolets, Bedfords, and Studebakers), a squadron of light tanks (L3s), eleven batteries of artillery,[7] and aircraft.[6] Special vehicles carried 193 horses so that when the column arrived at the gates of Addis Ababa, the Marshal and his staff could leave their cars and ride in triumph on horseback.[7]\n\n## March\n\n[edit]On 24 April, Badoglio sent two columns of 4,000 Eritreans ahead by force march to protect his mechanized force as a precautionary measure. But the adversity the Eritreans and the march itself encountered was mainly caused by rain and mud. Badoglio's precautionary measure proved to be superfluous.[7]\n\n### Imperial highway\n\n[edit]Badoglio's mechanized force advanced along the Imperial Highway between Dessie and Addis Ababa. The Italian Commander-in-Chief was to uncharitably refer to this road as \"a bad cart track\".[8]\n\nBadoglio expected some show of resistance at Termaber Pass, and the mechanized column did halt there for two days but all was quiet. The column stopped because a section of the road had been demolished and had to be repaired.[7] On 4 May the Italian formation was ambushed in Chacha, near Debre Berhan, by Ethiopian forces under Haile Mariam Mammo. In the ensuing battle,\nHaile Mariam's men killed approximately 170 Italian colonial troops and captured four Italians, two of whom were doctors. They were later released.[9]\n\n### Addis Ababa\n\n[edit]In Addis Ababa, Emperor Haile Selassie visited the French Legation. After explaining to French Minister Paul Bodard that further defense of the capital was impossible, he explained that it was best for Empress Menen Asfaw and their two sons, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen, 19, and Prince Makonnen, 13, to leave the country. Ultimately they would go to the Coptic monastery in the British Mandate of Palestine, but he asked the French Minister whether the Imperial Family could temporarily find refuge in French Somaliland and was assured by Bodard that they could.[10]\n\nHaile Selassie then returned to his Palace and crowds gathered at the Palace steps. To the gathering throng, he said, \"Ethiopia, will fight until the last soldier and the last inch! Let every man who is not wounded or sick take arms and enough food to last five days and march north to fight the invader!\" The crowd roared back to their Emperor: \"We will go!\"[10][nb 1]\n\nForgetting the raw gas burns on his arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. He knew that the Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One possibility was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially, his chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under *Ras* Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but rather flee the country to avoid his execution.[10]\n\nAfter his meeting with his chieftains, Haile Selassie visited Sir Sidney Barton at the British Legation. He spoke softly to Sir Sidney but to the point. Britain had encouraged him with fine words and had made many promises. However, Britain had provided Ethiopia with few guns for which the Ethiopians had paid cash. Haile Selassie stressed that he had risked his own life for Ethiopia but also for the League of Nations. He asked Sir Sidney whether Britain would now come to his aid. They declined.[10]\n\nBefore he departed, Haile Selassie ordered that the government of Ethiopia be moved to Gore, he ordered that the mayor of Addis Ababa maintain order in the city until the Italian arrival, and he appointed *Ras* Imru Haile Selassie as his Prince Regent during his absence.[11]\n\nLate on 2 May, after the Emperor left the city to go into exile, there was a breakdown in civil order. Only the dregs of Ethiopia's soldiery were left behind in the doomed capital. They went wild, looted shops, screamed curses at foreigners, and fired rifles into the air. The new Palace, pride of Haile Selassie, was thrown open to the people. Most foreigners found safety within the British compound. In twenty-four hours, the Ethiopian Empire fell apart and native law and order disappeared. Rioting in Addis Ababa grew worse by the hour. An attack was made on the Treasury's \"gold house.\" A few loyal employees tried to save the remnant of Emperor's gold with machine guns, but sword-swinging looters rushed them and cut off their hands as they clung to their guns.[10]\n\n### The Arrival of the Italians\n\n[edit]During the evening of 4 May, elements of the I Eritrean Brigade reached the outskirts of Addis Ababa. They reached the city before Badoglio's mechanized column and they managed to accomplish this feat on foot.[12] Meanwhile, Badoglio's motorized column, pushing on as fast as possible, drew closer and closer. Italian aircraft reconnoitered over the city.[ citation needed]\n\nThe main column reached the capital at 4:00 pm on 5 May.\n\nHeavy rain fell as Badoglio's forces entered the city and restored order. The rioting that started after Haile Selassie left lasted until order was restored with the arrival of the Italians. White flags were displayed everywhere as Badoglio made his triumphal entry into the city of the \"King of Kings.\"[13] Many city residents fled south or tried to take refuge in the foreign compounds which they had been attacking.[ citation needed]\n\nA detachment of Ethiopian customs guards presented arms as Badoglio's car drove past them. Further on, an Italian guard of honor, which accompanied the advance guard for this very purpose, paid Badoglio the same courtesy. There was no question now of stopping to allow Badoglio to use the horses brought for this occasion. The car and truck bound procession continued.[13][nb 2]\n\nWhen Badoglio's entourage pulled up in front of the Italian legation at 5:45 pm, the Tricolour of the Kingdom of Italy was hoisted. Then followed three cheers for Italy's King Victor Emmanuel and three cheers for Italy's Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. After the cheering, Badoglio turned to a senior member of the Italian Royal Air Force and said:\n\n- \"We've done it! We've won!\"\n[13]\n\nThe fall of Addis Ababa had been expected in Italy. When the news reached Rome during the evening of 5 May, there were scenes of wild excitement. Mussolini was called back ten times by the jubilant crowds at the Palazzo Venezia.[7]\n\nSignificantly, the march was completed in only ten days across difficult terrain and in bad weather. It was an achievement that demonstrated the offensive potential of motorized forces in securing bold advances.[6] However, the Italian \"March of the Iron Will\" turned out to be little more than a logistics exercise. An anonymous journalist at the time said this:\n\n- \"Far more of a sports event than a page in military history.\"\n[7]\n\n## Aftermath\n\n[edit]During the week following Marshal Badoglio's entry into Addis Ababa, Dr. Johann Hans Kirchholtes, the German Minister to Ethiopia, visited what had been the Italian Legation in the Ethiopian capital city. Badoglio was now Viceroy and Governor-General of Italian East Africa and the former Italian Legation was now his headquarters. Kirchholtes provided the first recognition by any foreign government that the conquest of Ethiopia was an accomplished fact.[15]\n\nMeanwhile, one of Marshal Badoglio's staff officers, Captain Adolfo Alessandri, visited every foreign legation in Addis Ababa. Alessandri politely explained to each envoy that they would enjoy \"every diplomatic privilege until the time of your departure.\" This was Italy's official notification to the world that occupied Ethiopia would not be considered to be on the same footing as the Japanese Empire's puppet state of Manchukuo. Instead, the former Ethiopian Empire was to be a colony of the Kingdom of Italy. Giuseppe Bottai was named as the first Governor of Addis Ababa and Haile Selassie's former Palace became his residence.[15]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- East African Campaign (World War II)\n- Red Terror (Ethiopia)\n- Second Italo-Abyssinian War\n- Timeline of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War\n- Achille Starace\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]**^***Time*did not indicate what happened to the five-thousand men who marched north from Addis Ababa.**^***Time*indicates that Badoglio did stop to mount up and did enter Addis Ababa on horseback: \"After much sweating and shouting, the procession was reformed. First came a patrol of Blackshirt motorcyclists, young and exuberant, followed by ten tankettes, each one hastily named after a battle of the past seven months. Marshal Badoglio entered on horseback.\"[14]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]### Citations\n\n[edit]**^**Barker 1971, p. 108.**^**Barker 1971, p. 33.**^**Barker 1971, p. 56.**^**Barker 1971, p. 87.**^**Barker 1971, p. 96.- ^\n**a****b**Walker 2003, p. 36.**c** - ^\n**a****b****c****d****e****f****g**Barker 1971, p. 109.**h** **^**Mockler 2002, p. 127.**^**Akyeampong & Gates 2012, p. 543.- ^\n**a****b****c****d****e***Time*magazine, 11 May 1936[*better source needed*] **^**Mockler 2002, p. 136.**^**Mockler 2002, p. 141.- ^\n**a****b**Barker 1971, p. 128.**c** **^***Time*magazine, 18 May 1936- ^\n**a****b***Time*magazine, 13 May 1936\n\n### Sources\n\n[edit]- Akyeampong, Emmanuel Kwaku; Gates, Henry Louis, eds.

Members of the chamber were called '\"national councillors\" (*consiglieri nazionali*) rather than deputies. The councillors of the chamber did not represent geographic constituencies, but the different trades and industries of Italy, thus reflecting the corporatist idea of fascist ideology.\n\nCouncillors were elected for terms of undetermined length and automatically lost their seats upon their defection from the branch they did represent. Renewal of the legislature was ordered by decree by the King of Italy, on specific instruction of the head of government (Mussolini).\n\n## Appointment\n\n[edit]The creation of the Chamber of Fasces and Corporations was the culmination of the progressive curtailment of the independence of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy following Mussolini's formal proclamation of dictatorship in 1925. All other parties were formally banned in 1926, though Italy had effectively been a one-party state for a year before then. At the elections of 1929 and 1934, voters were presented with a single list of Fascist candidates chosen by the Grand Council of Fascism.\n\nNo elections took place in Italy between 1934 and 1946. Unlike earlier elections for the legislature held under the Fascist era, popular suffrage was eliminated altogether. Instead, the lower house would be a body comprising representatives of the various corporations of Italy, fulfilling Benito Mussolini's vow of creating a \"corporate state\".\n\nThe candidates for the approximately 600 seats were nominated summarily by three organs: the Grand Council, the National Council of the members of the PNF, and the different corporations resembling the entire trade and industry of Italy, canalized through the National Council of Corporations (*Consiglio Nazionale delle Corporazioni*), effectively in the hands of Mussolini and the PNF.\n\n## Powers and procedures\n\n[edit]The Chamber of Fasces and Corporations shared the legislative powers with the Government and the Royal Senate.\n\nThe only bills that were actually discussed by the plenary assembly, both in the Chamber and in the Senate, were the ones regarding constitutional amendments, legislative delegation and budget laws; the other bills were directly examined and passed by the parliamentary commissions, unless the Chamber, with authorization from the Head of the Government, decided to debate it in the assembly. By order of the Head of the Government, even the laws that required approval by the plenary assembly could be approved directly by the commissions, should urgency reasons require it.\n\nThe powers of the Chamber was largely marginal, but it still exercised some influence onto the legislative process: according to Italian historian Renzo de Felice, the parliamentary commissions were often subjected to strong corporate influence, which the fascist government had to deal with.[2]\n\n## Presidents\n\n[edit]| N. | Portrait | Name (Born\u2013Died) |\nTerm of office | Party | Legislature | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Took office | Left office | Time in office | ||||||\n| 1 | Costanzo Ciano(1876\u20131939) |\n23 March 1939 | 26 June 1939\u2020 | 95 days | PNF | XXX ( no election)\n| ||\n| 2 | Dino Grandi(1895\u20131988) |\n30 November 1939 | 2 August 1943 | 3 years, 245 days | PNF |\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## Notes\n\n[edit]**^**Data relative to the year 1939.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**Minister Calderoli explained the subtle nuances between dissolution of the Camera dei fasci e delle corporazioni and express repeal of its founding law of 1939, never taken place and now required \"for cleaning needs of legislative databases\": Buonomo, Giampiero (2009). \"La Camera dei fasci e delle corporazioni o il Senato regio?

It was characterized by mass strikes, worker manifestations as well as self-management experiments through land and factories occupations.[4] In Turin and Milan, workers councils were formed and many factory occupations took place under the leadership of anarcho-syndicalists. The agitations also extended to the agricultural areas of the Po Valley and were accompanied by peasant strikes, rural unrests and guerrilla conflicts between left-wing and right-wing militias.\n\nIn the general election of 1921, the Liberal governing coalition, strengthened by the joining of Fascist candidates in the National Bloc (33 of whom were elected deputies), came short of a majority. The Italian Socialist Party, weakened by the split of the Communist Party of Italy, lost many votes and seats, while the Italian People's Party was steady around 20%. The Socialists were stronger in Lombardy (41.9%), than in their historical strongholds of Piedmont (28.6%), Emilia-Romagna (33.4%) and Tuscany (31.0%), due to the presence of the Communists (11.9, 5.2 and 10.5%), while the Populars were confirmed the largest party of Veneto (36.5%) and the Liberal parties in most Southern regions.[5]\n\n## Parties and leaders\n\n[edit]| Party | Ideology | Leader | Status before election | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Italian Socialist Party (PSI) | Socialism | Giovanni Bacci | Opposition | |\n| Italian People's Party (PPI) | Christian democracy | Luigi Sturzo | Government | |\n| National Bloc (BN) | Conservatism | Giovanni Giolitti | Government | |\n| Italian Democratic Liberal Party (PLDI) | Liberalism | Antonio Salandra | Government | |\n| Liberal Party (PL) | Liberalism | Luigi Facta | Government | |\n| Social Democracy (DS) | Social liberalism | Giovanni Antonio Colonna | Government | |\n| Communist Party of Italy (PCdI) | Communism | Amadeo Bordiga | Opposition | |\n| Italian Republican Party (PRI) | Republicanism | Eugenio Chiesa | Opposition | |\n| Reformist Democratic Party (PDR) | Social liberalism | Several | Opposition | |\n| Combatants' Party (PdC) | Veteran interests | Several | Government |\n\n## Results\n\n[edit]| Party | Votes | % | Seats | +\/\u2013 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Italian Socialist Party | 1,631,435 | 24.69 | 123 | \u221233 | |\n| Italian People's Party | 1,347,305 | 20.39 | 108 | +8 | |\nNational Bloc[a] | 1,260,007 | 19.07 | 105 | New | |\n| Italian Democratic Liberal Party | 684,855 | 10.36 | 68 | \u221228 | |\n| Liberal Party | 470,605 | 7.12 | 43 | +2 | |\n| Social Democracy | 309,191 | 4.68 | 29 | \u221231 | |\n| Communist Party of Italy | 304,719 | 4.61 | 15 | New | |\n| Italian Republican Party | 124,924 | 1.89 | 6 | \u22123 | |\n| Reformist Democratic Party | 122,087 | 1.85 | 11 | New | |\n| Combatants' Party | 113,839 | 1.72 | 10 | \u221210 | |\n| Lists of Slavs and Germans | 88,648 | 1.34 | 9 | New | |\n| Economic Party | 53,382 | 0.81 | 5 | \u22122 | |\n| Independent Socialists | 37,892 | 0.57 | 1 | \u00b10 | |\n| Dissident Populars | 29,703 | 0.45 | 0 | New | |\n| Fasci Italiani di Combattimento | 29,549 | 0.45 | 2 | New | |\n| Total | 6,608,141 | 100.00 | 535 | +27 | |\n| Valid votes | 6,608,141 | 98.61 | |||\n| Invalid\/blank votes | 93,355 | 1.39 | |||\n| Total votes | 6,701,496 | 100.00 | |||\n| Registered voters\/turnout | 11,477,210 | 58.39 | |||\nSource: National Institute of Statistics[6] |\n\n## Results by Region\n\n[edit]| Region | First party | Second party | Third party | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Abruzzo-Molise | BN | PLDI | PSI | |||\n| Apulia | BN | PSI | PPI | |||\n| Basilicata | BN | PLDI | PPI | |||\n| Calabria | BN | PLDI | SD | |||\n| Campania | PLDI | BN | PSI | |||\n| Emilia-Romagna | PSI | BN | PPI | |||\n| Lazio | PPI | BN | PSI | |||\n| Liguria | PSI | BN | PPI | |||\n| Lombardy | PSI | BN | PPI | |||\n| Marche | PPI | PSI | BN | |||\n| Piedmont | PSI | BN | PLDI | |||\n| Sardinia | BN | PPI | PSI | |||\n| Sicily | BN | SD | PLDI | |||\n| Trentino | PPI | BN | SeT | |||\n| Tuscany | PSI | PPI | BN | |||\n| Umbria | PSI | PPI | BN | |||\n| Veneto | PPI | PSI | BN | |||\n| Venezia Giulia | BN | PPI | SeT |\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**Dieter Nohlen & Philip St\u00f6ver (2010)*Elections in Europe: A data handbook*, p1047 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7**^**ITALY\u2019S FRINGE OF ALIEN SUBJECTS,*The New York Times*, May 29, 1921**^**Ministry of National Economy- ^\n**a**Brunella Dalla Casa,**b***Composizione di classe, rivendicazioni e professionalit\u00e0 nelle lotte del \"biennio rosso\" a Bologna*, in: AA.

However, uncertainty exists regarding the factors necessary to stimulate use. We draw on in-depth interviews with local industry, agency, community, and tribal representatives from 10 study sites on federal public lands across the United States to examine persistent conventional wisdoms about what hinders biomass use. Findings indicate that the conventional wisdoms were reasonably accurate although the degree to which each impeded progress varied. Their interconnectedness also varied depending on local conditions. Supply guarantees, industry presence, transportation, and the value of the biomass were limiting factors to use, whereas agency budgets and staffing, environmental concerns, and partnerships more aggravated the problem than impeded progress. Understanding the scope and consistency of these accepted truths is important for ensuring that management efforts and ensuing policy effectively targets local use challenges.\n\n## Publication Title\n\nJournal of Forestry\n\n## Recommended Citation\n\nBecker, D.

It provides graduate-level military education courses designed to develop leadership abilities within the Canadian Forces in a whole-of-government framework. The CFC campus is located at 215 Yonge Boulevard, on the north side of Wilson Avenue in the Armour Heights neighborhood of Toronto, Ontario.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The institution was established in 1943 as the Royal Canadian Air Force War Staff College. The site was originally a property named *Strathrobyn* that was owned by real estate developer Frederick Burton Robins (1866\u20131948),[1] and the centrepiece was a large Tudor Revival mansion which was built around 1914 pursuant to a design by the architectural firm of George & Moorhouse.[2] The estate was renamed as *Glenalton* after it was purchased in 1926 for $175,000 by businessman Albert Leroy Ellsworth (1876\u20131950),[3] who had founded the British American Oil Company in 1906. Ellsworth used the property as his residence until about 1942, at which point the Royal Canadian Air Force rented it from him to use as a wartime staff college.[4] In the autumn of 1945, the Government of Canada bought the estate from Ellsworth for $103,500.[3]\n\nIn 1945, the college was re-designated as the Royal Canadian Air Force Staff College, which became a component of the Air Force College in 1962. The Air Force College also included a Headquarters, a Staff School and an Extension School. Following integration of the Canadian Armed Forces, the college was renamed as the Canadian Forces College (CFC) in 1966. The Tudor Revival mansion containing the Officers' Mess was designated a \"Recognized Federal Heritage Building\" by the Canadian government in 1991.[5]\n\nThe Canadian Forces Staff School for junior officers, formerly located at 1107 Avenue Road, was determined to be redundant and closed in 1994. That property was later sold to the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now called the Toronto Catholic District School Board), and it re-opened in 1998 as Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School.\n\n## Curriculum\n\n[edit]The programmes at the College are designed to \u201cprovide high-quality professional military education for selected Canadian and international officers[.]\u201d[6][7] The curriculum includes military doctrine, exercise and simulation, and the command, control, and administration of allocated personnel and financial resources. Instruction is bilingual and students are permitted to present written deliverables in the language of their choice.[8] The institution maintains a partnership with the Royal Military College of Canada as well as liaisons with many other national and foreign educational institutions.\n\n## Programmes\n\n[edit]- Joint Command and Staff Programme (JCSP)\n- National Security Programme (NSP)\n- Joint Command and Staff Programme Distance Learning (JCSP DL)\n- Joint Staff Operations Programme (JSOP)\n- Canadian Security Studies Programme (CSSP)\n- Executive Leaders' Programme (ELP)\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- Royal Military College Saint-Jean\n- Royal Roads Military College\n- Royal Military College of Canada\n- Canadian government scientific research organizations\n- Canadian university scientific research organizations\n- Canadian industrial research and development organizations\n- The Canadian Crown and the Canadian Forces\n- Defence Research and Development Canada\n- Khaki University\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Strathrobyn\".

Founded in 1943 as the RCAF War Staff College, it has undergone several stages of reorganization that reflect the evolution of the professional development of Canadian military officers.\n\nAfter the War, in 1945, it was designated as the RCAF Staff College. In 1962, the Staff College became a component of the Air Force College that also included a Headquarters, a Staff School and an Extension School. The latter was operated jointly with the University of Toronto Extension Department from 1963 to 1974. As a result of unification of and integration of the Armed Forces in 1964, a new course was designed to meet the requirements of a unified force structure. In 1966, it was introduced as part of the curriculum of the re-designated Canadian Forces College. Following the Officer Development Board Report of 1969, further modifications were made and, in 1974, the Staff College Course was converted to the Command and Staff Course which now exists. In 1998, the CFC's role was expanded, as two new courses were inaugurated: the Advanced Military Studies Course for the September-December period, followed by the National Securities Studies Course from January to June. The two courses are independent, and some senior officers attend the courses in sequence.\n\nIt is fitting that the College site at Armour Heights has been associated with military aeronautics and civilian aviation. Adjacent to the present college property, an airfield was built in 1917 as a training base for the Royal Flying Corps. In 1918, it was used by the School of Special Flying to train Royal Flying Corps instructors in newly developed techniques of flight instruction. In 1919, it was occupied by Bishop-Barker Aeroplanes Limited, a commercial venture of two distinguished combat pilots, William Avery Bishop and William George Barker.\n\nThe College was first housed in the present-day Officers' Mess, with its adjoining garage and converted stables; these facilities were originally rented and finally purchased by the RCAF in 1946. This stately mansion was built in 1914 as a private residence for Colonel F.B. Robins, Honorary Colonel of the Toronto Scottish Regiment. The College was expanded with the construction of Curtis Hall in 1952 and its enlargement in 1961 and 1973. Existing temporary structures were removed in 1988 after the completion of Burns Hall, which houses the students' wing and an outstanding military library, the Air Vice-Marshal K.L.B. Hodson Memorial Library. In 1998, a third floor and the Rowley Auditorium were added to the north wing of Curtis Hall to accommodate newly-established advanced courses. In addition, the Dextraze Fitness Centre built next to the Mess was opened. The Ralston Residence, with 96 suites, was completed in October 1999. Construction of an extension to Curtis and Burns Halls was begun in the Fall of 2001 and completed in Spring 2002. The extension, DeWolf Hall provides additional office space, an expansion to the library and facilities for exercise support and war-gaming.\n\nAs in the past, the Canadian Forces College continues to play an important role in the professional development of Canadian officers who seek to make a significant contribution to the military profession and to their country. Among distinguished graduates and former staff are most of Canada's high-ranking officers.\n\n- Date modified:","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_XOrrmFCKmccwp7M40NLplKfH\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Air Command and Staff College renamed 1960s 'renamed early 1960s' trains national and international officers 'renamed' '1962' '1966' 'Air Command and Staff College history international officers'\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Air Command and Staff College - Wikipedia\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Air_Command_and_Staff_College\nACSC prepares field grade or equivalent level commissioned officers of all U.S. military services in pay grade O-4 (e.g., majors in the U.S. Air Force, U.S. ...\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Air Command and Staff College - Air University\nURL: https:\/\/www.airuniversity.af.edu\/ACSC\/\nAir Command and Staff College is the intermediate Air Force professional military school.

Run by North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) (after its creation), over half were staffed by United States Air Force personnel with the balance operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force. The line was the first coordinated system for early detection of a Soviet bomber attack on North America. Its radar technology quickly became outdated, and the line was in full operation only for a short time.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]Plans for what would become the Pinetree Line were underway as early as 1946 within the Permanent Joint Board on Defense (PJBD), a Canadian-U.S. organization. However, the costs of running such a system in the post-war era was too high, and instead Canada concentrated on the areas around Ontario and Quebec, while the United States set up stations in the Midwest and along the eastern seaboard.\nWith the successful test of an atomic bomb in the USSR, plans changed considerably. In 1949 Congress agreed to a $161 million construction program in co-operation with the RCAF, for a continuous line of stations across southern Canada. The USAF's Continental Air Command and the RCAF met in October 1950 to start planning, and in January 1951 the PJBD presented *Recommendation 51\/1 for the Extension of the Continental Radar Defence System*. The USAF later requested an additional set of six (potentially) mobile stations to provide low-level coverage. Later, it was learned the original radar systems performed better than expected, hence a number of the mobile sites were never deployed.\n\nThe system was eventually deployed as a series of 33 main stations and 6 smaller \"gap fillers\". The majority of these ran in a line at about the 53rd parallel in the west (to offer coverage of major Canadian cities) and about the 50th parallel in the east. A second line ran up the eastern seaboard from the southern tip of Nova Scotia to the southern tip of Baffin Island. Of these, 22 of the main stations and all of the gap fillers were paid for by the USAF, leaving 11 to the RCAF. However 16 of the main stations were staffed by RCAF personnel. On 1 January 1955, the system was officially handed over to RCAF command, and over time an additional 10 stations were added. The stations on the east coast used the Pole Vault system for communication.\n\nThe Pinetree Line had several technical problems that limited its usefulness almost immediately. For one, the system used a simple pulse radar technique, which made it unable to detect targets close to the ground due to radar clutter as well as being trivially easy to jam using the recently introduced carcinotron tube. Another was that its location near population centres meant it offered only a last minute warning, and as the USSR moved to jet-powered bombers the warning time was reduced. Studies were already underway in 1951 to build a series of Doppler bistatic radar stations somewhat farther north, which would develop into the Mid-Canada Line. By 1957, just over a year after the Mid-Canada Line was operational, a more advanced long-range search radar, mainly in the Canadian north and Alaska were deployed comprising the Distant Early Warning Line.\n\nThe Pinetree stations were kept operational during this period, and most underwent modifications as a part of the deployment of the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE). SAGE dramatically reduced the workload at the stations, cutting staff requirements by well over half. By the later 1950s some were being mothballed as newer systems came on line to the north. Nevertheless, many of the Pinetree stations were kept operational into the 1980s, particularly on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\n\n## Radar stations\n\n[edit]Initial sort is based on longitude from east to west.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- List of Royal Canadian Air Force stations\n- United States general surveillance radar stations\n*Radar Station*, a 1953 short documentary about the Pinetree Line- Continental Air Defense Integration North\n- Continental Air Defense Command\n\n## References\n\n[edit]This article incorporates public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency\n\n*A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946\u20131980*, by Lloyd H.

With this time, the Americans could get about 40% of their interceptors flying, though the RCAF's number would be less.\n\nThe systems of radar to be used in the Line were AN\/MPS-4 or AN\/TPS-10 as height finder, and AN\/CPS-5 or AN\/TPS-1B as search radar. The buildings would be located above the ground.\n\nIn 1951 there was an agreement between the two countries that said the United States would cover a lot of the expense and that the radars would connect to the Permanent Radar System in the United States. 22 of the original stations would be paid for by the United States.\n\nIt was originally focused more on the east because this where most of the industry was but in the 1950s importance moved to Strategic Air Command bases. Therefore, between 1957-1964, holes in the Line in the Prairies and in Quebec and northern Ontario were filled.\n\nThese stations relied on communication systems which also helped civilians. Where able, the Pinetree Line drew on the communication lines that already existed, although they had to be further supported or updated. This was done by engineers from CN, CP, and Bell and the networks continued until the fall of the Soviet Union. At the bequest of the Canadian Department of Defence, one system was built that was no longer up to date in 1965 and Bell purchased it for $4 million.\n\nIn the early 1960s it was updated with new radar stations. Their purpose was to reach further north, and make use of new technology in radar, communications, and computers. These improvements were done due to Soviet bomber improvements. New long-range stations included Chbougamau Quebec, Moosonee Ontario, Gypsumvill Manitoba, Yorkton, Dana, and Alask in Saskatchewan, and Penhold Alberta.\n\nThe old stations were improved too, receiving new long-range radars and height-finder radars. This gave coverage of 200 miles and upwards of 50 000 feet and was compatible with SAGE.\n\nCanadians began to staff 11 radar stations that had been American and by 1963 all stations were in Canadian hands.\n\nTaking over these stations was part of the agreement after the Arrow failure and began with Beausejour Manitoba on October 1961 and continued to Lowther Ontario July 1, 1963. Also taken over were Barrington, Nova Scotia, Ramore, Pagwa, Armstrong, and Sioux Lookout Ontario, Saskatoon Mountain Alberta, and Baldy Hunghes, Puntzi Mountain, and Kamloops British Columbia.\n\nAbout 6 stations were shut down before 1965 but the majority continued into the 1970s.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_HPUFPFWDrldJbfeSja4lHd3G\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Pinetree Line 'gap fillers' 'Pole Vault' 'PoleVault' 'communication' 'gap filler' description 'Pole Vault system' 'communication system' 'Bell purchased' '1955'\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Pinetree Line - Wikipedia\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pinetree_Line\nThe Pinetree Line was a series of radar stations located across southern Canada at about the 50th parallel north, along with a number of other stations\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Pole Vault (communications system) - Wikipedia\nURL: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pole_Vault_(communications_system)\nPole Vault was the first operational tropospheric scatter communications system.

It linked radar sites and military airfields in Greenland and eastern Canada by telephone to send aircraft tracking and warning information across North America. The line stretched from Thule Air Force Base in northern Greenland, to Baffin Island and then along the eastern coast of Labrador and Newfoundland to St. John's for connection into existing commercial telecommunications networks.\n\nThe system was first proposed in 1952 to send information along the isolated Pinetree Line stations on the Labrador coast. This led to an initial proposal to use a microwave relay system, a relatively new technology at the time. The network would require 50 relays, many of them in the wilderness. Bell Canada won the contract to build the system after the USAF was convinced they could handle the job.\n\nBefore construction began, Bell learned of experiments with long-range troposcatter systems being carried out in the US by Bell Labs and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. These were limited by power, not the line of sight, greatly extending the range between stations. They borrowed one system for testing in Labrador and by late 1954 had successfully demonstrated links of several hundred kilometres. This allowed them to reduce the network to only 10 stations, all at the existing radar sites.\n\nThe first message was sent on the network on February 14, 1955, but due to the extension to Thule and upgrades to carry more lines at the behest of the USAF it was not finally handed over until December 31, 1956. The system was used operationally until 1975 when it was replaced by newer systems including ionospheric skip systems, underwater cables and, eventually, satellite communications.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Pinetree problems\n\n[edit]The Pinetree Line began as early studies in 1946 for a radar network for the northern continental United States (CONUS). It was soon extended northward into Canada as the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) expressed interest in joining the network. Moving the line northward presented the problem of sending tracking data between the stations and especially back to various headquarters. For stations in the west, which were generally located close to existing population centers, leased lines were a suitable solution. Such was not the case for the eastern areas on the Line, where northern areas were little developed.[1]\n\nTo solve a local problem near the Ontario and Quebec border, starting in 1950 the RCAF began construction of a microwave relay system known as ADCOM. This was a version of the Wireless Set Number 10 system developed by the British during World War II for tactical communications and links from France back to England. The Canadian Signals Research and Development Establishment (CSRDE) developed a dual-frequency version of this system and was pressing for it to be used on a number of Pinetree-related projects. Project management issues and creeping featuritis led to the initial price estimate of the system, about $5 million, going up several times and eventually reaching $22 million (equivalent to $243,400,000 in 2023) by the time it was fully operational.[2]\n\nThe Pinetree Line's eastern barrier was a line of stations running from St. Johns and Stephenville on Newfoundland and then northward along the Labrador coast before ending on Baffin Island at Crystal II airbase at Frobisher Bay, a total distance of 1,400 mi (2,250 km). The majority of this portion of the Line is among almost uninhabited areas and there was little or no existing telephony available. These sites had instead been equipped with conventional high frequency radio links, but these soon proved inadequate.[2]\n\nIn May 1952, the Department of Defence Production (DDP) suggested building a microwave network for these stations too. The DDP proposed solution was similar to the one used by ADCOM.[3] Given the problems with ADCOM, the U.S. contingent of the Pinetree Project Office (PPO) proved sceptical although they reluctantly agreed to the project.[1]\n\n### Initial concept\n\n[edit]In May 1952, Alex Lester was loaned from Bell Canada to the Electronics Division of the DDP to coordinate the military's communications developments with Bell. He soon learned of the problems with the Pinetree Line's communications, and approached Thomas Wardrope Eadie, then Vice President of Operations at Bell, with the idea that Bell would offer to take on construction management of the line.[4]\n\nThis led to further project studies that considered forming a new crown corporation to handle development, telling the U.S. to do it, or contracting Bell. The government was averse to creating new crown corporations, and was very concerned that handing it to the U.S. would result in a loss of opportunity for Canadian workers, and so Bell was in. They also reconsidered various technologies, including underwater lines, but concerns over the storm-tossed waters and 40 foot (12 m) tides in Frobisher Bay suggested this would not be reliable and the microwave relay appeared to be the only solution.[4]\n\nThus the concept settled on an initial system of twenty relays covering the 700 miles (1,100 km) from CFB Gander to CFB Goose Bay, and then a second stage with another thirty towers that would expand it northward to Frobisher Bay and southward to St. John's and westward to Stephenville. The network would be based on the commercial 2.4 GHz TD2 system being deployed by AT&T in the U.S., and soon in Canada as well. This system would use frequency division multiplexing to carry 36 voice channels across a series of selected frequencies. On November 4, 1952, Bell gave the DDP their initial proposal.[5]\n\nThe next day they learned that the PPO was already well along the process of accepting the ADCOM-like system being proposed by the CSRDE. This used two separate frequencies, one at 2.0 GHz and another at 400 MHz, to allow switching between the two to avoid interference. The matter was then sent back to the U.S. for review. After months of silence, on April 2, 1953, the DDP sent a letter to Bell, Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway, at that time the only three firms with national telecommunications experience, stating they would be taking bids on the system based on the CSRDE concept.[5]\n\nIn an April 30 letter, Bell agreed to bid on the project, but only if the risks of using the CSRDE system were acknowledged. This was accepted, and on July 23 the contract with the DDP was signed.[6] The phase one development for the sites between Goose Bay and Gander had a handover date of September 30, 1955.[7] The radio systems were provided by third parties; Canadian General Electric produced the 2.0 GHz system while Canadian Westinghouse supplied the 400 MHz system, and Canadian Marconi supplied various other pieces of equipment.[7] A test link was operational between Bell's corporate office in downtown Montreal and Ormstown, southwest of the city about 50 kilometres (31 mi) away. Further testing was needed, but progress was being made.[8]\n\n### Troposcatter takes over\n\n[edit]Previous to World War II, prevailing radio physics theory predicted a relationship between frequency and diffraction that suggested radio signals would follow the curvature of the Earth, but that the strength of the effect fell off rapidly and especially at higher frequencies. However, during the war, there were numerous incidents in which high-frequency radar signals were detecting targets at ranges far beyond the theoretical calculations. In the immediate post-war era, the limitation on television construction was lifted and millions of sets were sold. This led to further examples of very long-range reception, which was a significant problem when widely separated stations given the same frequency allocations would interfere with each other at ranges that the equations stated would not be a problem. As a result, new stations were put on hold in what is known as the \"television freeze\" in 1948.[9]\n\nAt the same time, AT&T was beginning experiments with the early TD2 network. They too saw examples of interference between far-separated towers. In 1950, Kenneth Bullington[a] of Bell Labs published a report on the topic that demonstrated over-the-horizon transmission was possible at high frequencies using the previously unknown phenomenon of scattering off the troposphere. Scattering off the ionosphere was a well-known phenomenon used since the earliest days of radio, but only worked at lower frequencies and the similar effect with the troposphere had remained undetected until high-power UHF signals began being used.[9]\n\nThe possibility of using this concept for long-distance communications was obvious, and Bell Labs soon started an experiment series with the researchers at the Lincoln Laboratory, a radar research centre affiliated with MIT. They began experimental tests in early 1952. In their August 1952 proposal, Bell agreed to liaise with their counterparts in the U.S., and learned of the experiments. This was extremely appealing; relay links were typically on the order of 30 miles (48 km), the local horizon, but this new system could operate over distances at least five times as great.[11]\n\nBell proposed that the pressing need to link Goose Bay and Gander be carried out with the original relay system as soon as possible, but that the rest of the links in the chain be delayed until the results of the experimental system could be examined. In the fall of 1952, Bell Labs agreed to send their system to Bell Canada for cold weather testing in Labrador for a series of experiments that would last about a year.[11] Meanwhile, similar tests were taking place in the southern U.S. to determine which frequencies worked best, and this determined that the original 2 GHz range was not as effective as lower frequencies between 500 and 1000 MHz. Bell's tests in Labrador were extremely favourable and both Bell Canada and Bell Labs agreed that the system was ready for development.[12]\n\nBell proposed a new network with stations co-located at the Pinetree stations, about 150 miles (240 km) apart. If this proved too challenging in practice, additional stations could be built at the midpoints. The original network of 50 stations for the entire network was reduced to 10, all at sites with existing logistics support.[12] The initial concept was for the southern sections to have 36 voice channels as far north as Hopedale, 24 circuits to Resolution Island and then 12 on the final short hop to Frobisher Bay.[13] The estimated cost of the original relay system was $41 million, but widely expected to run over this. The new system was expected to be much less expensive.[14]\n\n### Construction\n\n[edit]The U.S. had been skeptical of the CSRDE system all along, and when Bell presented their results in the fall of 1953 the USAF proposed replacing the entire system including the link from Goose Bay to Gander. General Blake of the USAF began working with the PPO and had approval for the new concept in January 1954.[15] At the time, Thule Air Force Base was connected to the continental USA via an underwater cable. This proved highly unreliable as it was repeatedly cut by fishing trawlers. The USAF requested that the line be extended to Thule via a relay at Cape Dyer.[13] A final plan was signed on January 7, 1954, with the target completion date of the initial network in February 1955. The original contract was modified, adding the scatter network to the original microwave relay system.[14]\n\nThe first pieces of equipment to be contracted were the 36 60 foot (18 m) parabolic antennas, signed on February 10 for initial delivery starting in July. These needed to be able to withstand a 120 knots (220 km\/h; 140 mph) wind or 100 knots (190 km\/h; 120 mph) when covered in ice. Contracts for the electronics soon followed, along with contracts for physical construction.[16] The 10 kilowatt UHF transmitters, compared to 5 watt klystrons used in point-to-point relays, was sourced from Radio Engineering Laboratories in New York. For the later links between Cape Dyer and Thule even larger transmitters were used, 50 kW.[14]\n\nWork continued on the microwave system as well, but ultimately only the first two stations starting from Goose Bay were built before the project was cancelled in favour of the scatter system.[17] This was formalized in September 1956 when a final contract amendment changed the wording so that Bell was now responsible only for design of the relay, not its construction.[18]\n\nThe formal construction contract with Olmstead Air Force Base, the contracting authority, was signed on March 23, 1954. Construction began in mid-April and the first station at Goose Bay was completed in 6 weeks. Based on this success, the USAF also gave Bell the contract for building the local telephone switches at a number of other stations, including Thule and Pepperrell Air Force Base in St. Johns. This was followed by an April 28 bid on stations at Harmon Field (Stephensville) and Sondrestrom and Narssarssuaq on Greenland.[19]\n\nThe first test connection was made along the initial six stations on February 14, 1955. The line was declared fully operational end-to-end on December 31, 1956. The total cost came to $24,590,000 (equivalent to $270,146,084 in 2023), significantly less than the original relay system.[18] It was the first operational troposcatter system in the world.[20]\n\n### Upgrades\n\n[edit]By the time the system was operational, planning for two new radar lines was well advanced. Running across the middle of Canada was the Mid-Canada Line (MCL), whose eastern end was co-located with the Pinetree site at Hopedale, and far to the north was the DEW Line that ended at Cape Dyer.[21]\n\nThe MCL had the advantage that it was built on towers and had to be line-of-sight with each other, meaning the existing microwave relay technology could be used to link the stations together. As most of the stations were unmanned, the amount of data was very limited, basically forwarding the radar signal to one of the eight sector control centers where they were monitored. This did leave the problem of carrying the information from the sector controls to the command and control centers further south, which was handled by sending the information to James Bay where a new troposcatter system sent it south where it continued on using the ADCOM system. The eastern end linked through Pole Vault.[22]\n\nThe DEW line required much greater communications capacity, which led to a new troposcatter system being installed, the White Alice Communications System. This stretched across Alaska and the northern coast of Canada with additional links southward using both troposcatter and ionospheric relay for even longer connections. This also connected to the Pole Vault system at Cape Dyer, and an additional link from Thule to Hall Beach and then ionosphere skip to the MCL at RCAF Station Bird in Manitoba.[22]\n\nThe installation of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) required links not only in the U.S. and Canada, but also across the Atlantic to Iceland and the UK where it also linked to existing radars. For this task a new system was installed, the North Atlantic Radio System (NARS). Bell was contracted to help build stations in this network, at Sondrestrom and Narssarssuaq on Greenland, linking to Cape Dyer. This system went operational in 1961.[19] NARS also served as the trans-Atlantic portion of the Allied Command Europe Highband (ACE High) network which extended links across Europe. As the number of links increased, Pole Vault had to be upgraded to handle up to 70 circuits.[23][b]\n\n### Shutdown\n\n[edit]Advances in communications were continual from the 1950s and a number of new technologies emerged that began to compete with Pole Vault. Notable among these were greatly improved submarine cables, which led to the installation of a high-capacity system from Thule to Cape Dyer, and then on to Newfoundland. The addition of satellite communications for high-value links further eroded the value of the system. It was eventually shut down in 1975. Other sections of the system remained in use, notably the endpoint at Cape Dyer which was still used for NARS and ACE High traffic for some time.[23]\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]According to map prepared by the 1876 Radio Relay Squadron, the final layout of the system included nine primary stations. From the north end of the line, these were Frobisher Bay, Resolution Island, CFS Saglek, Hopedale Air Station, CFB Goose Bay, Saint Anthony Air Station, CFB Gander, Pepperrell Air Force Base in St. Johns and Ernest Harmon Air Force Base on the west coast of Newfoundland at Stephenville.[24]\n\nA typical station consisted of two of the 60 foot (18 m) diameter wire-mesh parabolic antennas, one for reception and the other for broadcast. Stations in the middle of the line would have two such setups, one pointed north and the other south. The station at Gander had a third for the link to Harmon. The stations at Harmon, Pepperrell and Frobisher (initially) had only one set, as they were at the ends of the lines.[25] The longest link in this main chain was from Resolution to Saglek, at 228 miles (367 km).[24]\n\nAdditionally, there were a number of gap filler radar stations connected to these main sites with shorter-range links using smaller 30 foot (9.1 m) antennas. These were at Cape Makkovik Air Station connecting to Hopedale, Cut Throat Island Air Station and Spotted Island Air Station connected to Cartwright, Fox Harbour Air Station and La Scie Air Station connected to St. Anthony, and Elliston Ridge Air Station and Red Cliff Air Station connected to Pepperrell.[24]\n\nIt is unclear whether the links from Frobisher to Thule were considered part of the official Pole Vault system. They do not appear on the 1876 Squadron map of the system in 1959, although they do appear on a map of the \"Tropospheric Scatter System\" in the same document.[24] A squadron detachment listing from the same document has Detachment 1 in St. Johns and 10 in Frobisher, and 11 through 17 as the gap fillers, with no listings for Cape Dyer or Thule.[26]\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]**^**The name is given as \"Kenneth Bulling\" in the original article, but the November 1958 edition of Bell Laboratory Record records the Stuart Ballantine Medal being awarded to \"Bullington\", hyphenated between Bulling and ton, which likely led to the later confusion.[10]**^**Given the use of standard modules based on units of 6, this is likely 72 channels.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]### Citations\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a**Lester 2019, p. 8.**b** - ^\n**a**Lester 2019, p. xiii.**b** **^**Lester 2019, p. xiv.- ^\n**a**Lester 2019, p. 9.**b** - ^\n**a**Lester 2019, p. 10.**b** **^**Lester 2019, p. 12.- ^\n**a**Lester 2019, p. 16.**b** **^**Lester 2019, p. 14.- ^\n**a**Stecker 1960.**b** **^**\"H.T.

Many of the Pinetree Line radar stations became operational in 1952-1953. Work was also progressing on both the DEW Line and the Mid-Canada Line. While it was great to have radar for early warning and ground control intercept - there was also a need for communications. Most of the radar installation locations were quite distant to the nearest telephone land line and a microwave system would be too costly. As a result - the Tropospheric Scatter System was developed and implemented.\n\nThe Tropospheric Scatter System would provide communications across the entire northern portion of North America.\n\nStarting in the northwest - the\n\n\"White Alice Communications System\" (WACS) was a tropospheric communications system throughout Alaska from about 1956 until 1979. There were 25 WACS tropo stations built originally at a total cost of $140 million. The system was designed by AT&T and built by the Western Electric Company taking 3,500 people three years to complete. Ultimately there would be 49 tropo sites. The first link in the White Alice Communications System was completed on 12 November 1956 and on 26 March 1958, the Alaska Air Command dedicated the White Alice Communications System which had been under construction since 1955. There is a story to the effect that the main transmitter was shut off in the summer of 1978 when the system was finally shut down. In a few seconds, the system switched itself back on. It didn't want to die! Actually it had an automatic reset which had been forgotten about. It was spooky for a minute though.White Alice was to connect with the tropospheric scatter system which had been constructed in the\n\n\"DEW Line\" .Tying the Northeast Air Command (NEAC) radar system together at first was only a HF\/LF communications system. Construction began in the summer of 1954 on a UHF tropospheric scatter system called the \"Pole Vault\" system by communications men. This tropospheric system, completed a year later in 1955, ran from Pepperrell, NF to Frobisher Bay, NWT including all of the stations in between. Later extensions were to go from Frobisher Bay to Cape Dyer and on to Thule. As can be expected, there was a great deal of ongoing change with the military communications groups during this period of time. We are aware of the following detail:\n\n| 1954 |\nThe Pole Vault system was initially managed by the 6631st Radio Relay Squadron. |\n| 1959 |\nThe Pole Vault system was now managed by the 1876th Radio Relay Squadron. |\n| 1961 |\nThe Pole Vault System was now managed by the 1933rd Communications Squadron. |\n\nDetachment locations remained somewhat constant, but Detachment location numbers appeared to change with the passing of time as units were added or removed from the system. Some of these are indicated below.\n\nUpdated: December 26, 2004","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step-by-step:\n\n1.

Local media said he blew himself up after throwing a grenade.\n\n\"I saw bodies everywhere. I saw bodies of women and children,\" one man told local media.\n\nAnother described scenes of chaos and devastation, with the shrine's courtyard \"filled with thousands of people who were crying and wailing\".\n\nImages from inside the shrine showed the floor covered with blood, with clothing and sandals strewn around.\n\nThe Edhi Welfare Trust, which runs Pakistan's largest ambulance service, said 43 of the dead were men, nine women and 20 children.\n\nAt least 250 others were wounded, a senior police official told the BBC. The only hospital in the area was said to be overwhelmed.\n\nThe critically injured were being sent by ambulance to Jamshoro and Hyderabad, some two hours away. The military said navy helicopters capable of flying at night would be sent to airlift the critically injured.\n\n## Return of violence: by M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad\n\nAfter a couple of years of diminishing violence credited to a military operation that kicked off in June 2014, the militants appear to have returned with a vengeance.\n\nIn six back-to-back attacks since Sunday, suicide bombers have killed nearly 100 people in different parts of the country.\n\nThere have been some spectacular, though sporadic, attacks in recent months that have exacted a significant toll on human life.\n\nBut the latest surge stands out in so far as it has come amid reports of the reunification of some powerful factions of the Pakistani Taliban. Some of these groups have links with the Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter of the so-called Islamic State which itself is composed largely of a former faction of the Pakistani Taliban.\n\nThis surge has blown the lid off an air of complacency that was brought on by statements of the military and civilian leaders to the effect that Pakistan had successfully defeated the militants.\n\nThe army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, now seems to have lost patience. On Thursday he issued a veiled threat to some neighbouring countries that \"each drop of [the] nation's blood shall be avenged, and avenged immediately. No more restraint for anyone\".\n\nPakistani officials have been accusing Afghanistan of not eliminating the sanctuaries of anti-Pakistan militants on its soil.\n\nIt has also been blaming India for using Afghan soil to foment trouble in Pakistan. But many here believe that militancy refuses to die down because Pakistan continues to tolerate selective militant structures as cover for its own covert wars that sustain the economy of its security establishment.\n\nPrime Minister Sharif has vowed to fight the militants who have carried out attacks.\n\n\"The past few days have been hard, and my heart is with the victims,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"But we can't let these events divide us, or scare us. We must stand united in this struggle for the Pakistani identity, and universal humanity.\"\n\nThe head of the military, Gen Qamer Javed Bajwa said that \"each drop of [the] nation's blood shall be revenged, and revenged immediately. No more restraint for anyone\".\n\nSufism, a mystical order of Islam, has been practised in Pakistan for centuries. Most of the radical Sunni militant groups despise the Sufis, as well as Shia Muslims, as heretics.\n\nTwo separate bombings in the country's north-west killed at least seven people on Wednesday.\n\nAnd on Monday, at least 13 people died in a suicide bombing in the eastern city of Lahore. A faction of the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ur-Ahrar, said it had carried out that attack.\n\n- Published15 February 2017\n\n- Published13 February 2017\n\n- Published1 February 2017","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_yqFbkq4W7LASWSPULmXnEjkj\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"American software entrepreneur philanthropist report on LGBT in Pakistan 'examining the standing' 'software entrepreneur' 'philanthropist' 'Pakistan' 'report' gay rights movement donation 'Pakistan' 'colonial penal code' 'Zia' article mention shrine attack local resident intervened name\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Human Rights Reports: Custom Report Excerpts - State Department\nURL: https:\/\/www.state.gov\/report\/custom\/5e9ebc3805\nArticle 660 of the penal code even details the punishment for authorities of ...

Pakistani authorities alleged that the attacks were orchestrated by jihadists in Afghanistan.[17]\n\n## Bombing\n\n[edit]The suicide bomber struck the pilgrims during a dhamaal (ritual dance) after the evening prayers.[2] The bomber threw a grenade which failed to explode.[2] Then he blew himself up inside the shrine hall under the dome, near its Golden Gate.[10] The bomber, believed to be an Afghan national, had bypassed the security check at the shrine.[18]\n\nAt least 21 children were believed to be among the dead.[19] The bomber used a suicide jacket, with the ball bearings in the jacket acting as shrapnel and causing casualties.[1]\n\n## Aftermath\n\n[edit]The injured and deceased were immediately shifted to the Taluka Medical Hospital[2] which was not equipped with a trauma centre to deal with emergency cases.[10] The medical facilities in Sehwan were basic, and some of the injured were in critical condition.[19][2] A state of emergency was declared for all hospitals in the neighbouring areas.[2] Pakistan Navy helicopters and a Pakistan Air Force C-130 were dispatched for rescue operations.[10]\n\nHours after the attack, law enforcement agencies launched a nationwide crackdown and search operation, during which over 100 militants were killed and scores arrested.[20] Several insurgents were confronted in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Weapons, including hand grenades, were recovered from their hideouts.[19] Police arrested a suspected facilitator in connection to the Sehwan attack from Johi, a town in Sindh's Dadu District.[18]\nOn 22 February 2017, a few days after attack, Pakistan Military launched Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad to eliminate terrorism.[21]\n\n### Resumption of daily services\n\n[edit]The next morning, the shrine's caretaker continued the daily tradition of ringing the shrine's bell at 3:30 am, and said that he would not be intimidated by terrorists.[22] The shrine's *dhamaal*, or meditative dancing ceremony, resumed the evening following the attack.[23] A few days later, several leading Pakistani artists and performers partook in a *dhamaal* at the shrine as a defiant response to radical Islamists.[24]\n\n## Reactions\n\n[edit]### Domestic\n\n[edit]Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the blast,[10] and said that \"an attack on the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar is an attack on the progressive and inclusive future of Pakistan.\"[2] A statement released by the military's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that the army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, had ordered that immediate assistance be provided to civil authorities.[2] Bajwa said \"Each drop of the nation's blood shall be revenged, and revenged immediately. No more restraint for anyone.\"[25]\n\nThe Governor of Sindh, Mohammad Zubair, condemned the blast and said \"Sindh is a land of the Sufis. The terrorists have targeted the devotees to achieve their nefarious designs.\"[2] The Government of Sindh announced three days of mourning in Sindh, while the governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan also announced a day of mourning in their respective provinces.[26]\n\n#### Strikes on Afghan camps\n\n[edit]ISPR spokesman, Major General Asif Ghafoor, tweeted: \"Recent terrorist acts are being executed on directions from hostile powers and from sanctuaries in Afghanistan. We shall defend and respond\".[25] A few hours after the incident, the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was sealed indefinitely for security reasons.[27][28][29] On 17 February, the Pakistan Army summoned Afghan embassy officials to the General Headquarters and handed over a list of 76 insurgents hiding in Afghanistan. The army demanded that Kabul take \"immediate action\" or have them \"handed over to Pakistan\".[17] The same day, army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa made a telephone call to the general commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, John W. Nicholson, and expressed concern over such incidents in Pakistan linked to safe havens in Afghanistan. Bajwa stated \"Such terrorist activities and inaction against them are testing our current policy of cross border restraint\" and urged Nicholson for cooperation in dismantling the militant networks, in addition to briefing him about the list of wanted terrorists.[30] Later, Pakistani security forces destroyed a dozen Jamaat-ul-Ahrar camps across the border in eastern Afghanistan, and killed over a dozen militants including a top trainer of suicide bombers.[31][32] The strikes were confirmed by Afghan sources, who said that several Pakistani artillery rounds had hit Nangarhar Province's Lal Pur District and that \"15 to 20 terrorists, among them Commander Rehman Baba, have been killed and many more injured.\"[33] The Afghan foreign ministry also protested the shelling by Pakistan on its territory.[34][35]\n\n### International\n\n[edit]- Afghanistan: President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, stating that \"terrorists once again, proved that they have no respect for Islamic values\".\n[36]Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack and offered sympathy to the families of victims and people of Pakistan.[37] - Belarus: Ambassador Andrei Ermolovich condemned the Sehwan blast while expressing solidarity with Pakistan. He also said that Belarus stands with Pakistan in its efforts for elimination of terrorism.\n[38] - China: President Xi Jinping condemned the attack and offered sympathy to the Pakistani people. He said that China \"will stand ready to firmly support Pakistan in its effort to fight terrorism, maintain national stability and safeguard its people\". Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also expressed shock and condemned the attack.\n[37] - India: The Indian external affairs ministry strongly condemned the attack on the Lal Qalandar shrine at Sehwan and offered their sympathies to Pakistani people.\n[39] - Japan: A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that \"Japan is shocked and saddened by the suicide attack\".\n[40][41] - Kyrgyzstan: President Almazbek Atambayev expressed sorrow and offered condolences over the terrorist attack.\n[37] - Russia: President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences over the incident, while reaffirming Russia's \"readiness to further step up counter-terrorist cooperation\" with Pakistan.\n[37][40] - Tajikistan: President Emomali Rahmon offered condolence adding that the Tajik people \"are deeply saddened by the tragic news\".\n[40] - United States: Acting State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said the U.S. condemned the suicide bombing and offered its \"support to the Pakistani government as it works to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice\". He added: \"We stand with the people of Pakistan in their fight against terrorism and remain committed to the security of the South Asia region.\"\n[42]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]- List of terrorist incidents linked to Islamic State \u2013 Khorasan Province\n- Sufism in Pakistan\n- Terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2017\n\n## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a**Hashmi, Talha (17 February 2017). \"Sehwan suicide bomber was not female: CTD official Raja Umar Khattab\".**b***Geo TV*.

The success of this treatment is highly dependent on parameters such as tissue electrical properties, applied voltages and spatial relations in placement of electrodes that are used to establish a cell-permeabilizing electric field in target tissue. Non-thermal irreversible electroporation techniques for ablation of tissue depend similarly on these parameters. In the treatment planning stage, if oversimplified approximations for evaluation of electric field are used, such as U\/d (voltage-to-distance ratio), sufficient field strength may not be reached within the entire target (tumor) area, potentially resulting in treatment failure.\n\n### Results\n\nIn order to provide an aid in education of medical personnel performing electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation, assist in visualizing the electric field in needle electrode electroporation and the effects of changes in electrode placement, an application has been developed both as a desktop- and a web-based solution. It enables users to position up to twelve electrodes in a plane of adjustable dimensions representing a two-dimensional slice of tissue. By means of manipulation of electrode placement, i.e. repositioning, and the changes in electrical parameters, the users interact with the system and observe the resulting electrical field strength established by the inserted electrodes in real time. The field strength is calculated and visualized online and instantaneously reflects the desired changes, dramatically improving the user friendliness and educational value, especially compared to approaches utilizing general-purpose numerical modeling software, such as finite element modeling packages.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we outline the need and offer a solution in medical education in the field of electroporation-based treatments, e.g. primarily electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible tissue ablation. We present the background, the means of implementation and the fully functional application, which is the first of its kind. While the initial feedback from students that have evaluated this application as part of an e-learning course is positive, a formal study is planned to thoroughly evaluate the current version and identify possible future improvements and modifications.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n\n## Background\n\n### Electroporation\n\nElectroporation is a term coined in the early 1980's [1] for phenomena already described more than a decade earlier [2], when an interesting property of biological membranes has been observed. Electroporation mainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly composed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short and intense electric fields. The physical mechanism responsible for increased permeability is thought to be the formation of nano-scale defects termed *pores* (thus electro*poration*) in the lipid structure [3, 4]. This allows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact mechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is too high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not temporary, but instead result in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversible electroporation. On the other hand, if the cells survive, increased permeability of membrane is only temporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible electroporation. This observed transient increase in permeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of applications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA) delivery, introduction of drugs into cells, fusion of cells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer, gene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of drugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6, 7] for an overview. In these applications viability of the porated cells is important and thus irreversible electroporation is consciously avoided and generally considered to be an undesired side effect. However, there are also interesting medical applications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering the domains of industrial [9, 10] and environmental [11] applications.\n\n### Electrochemotherapy\n\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that successfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs. For successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate amplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and shape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake and hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been identified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13, 14]. The transport of bleomycin across the nonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited [15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and DNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity of bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several thousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is the electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent increase in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to reach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17, 18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be eradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be permeabilized, i.e. all cells in the tumor have to be exposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means that the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends on both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high electric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we must consider before we can confidently assume we have successfully electroporated the entire tumor area. First, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue electrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity compared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric field strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields in the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue of electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their shape, size and position. In general, there are two types of electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate electrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with either a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two plates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively, which ensures good electrical contact, but has other drawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure good electrical contact and optimal distance between electrodes to fit the tumor [21, 22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous and dependent on their diameter, distance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013 the task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even more arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19, 24] and in vivo studies [25] on importance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need for careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted by a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) project, in the scope of which standard operating procedures for ECT were published [26]. However, in advanced cases such as intracranial [27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need for patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29, 30].\n\n### Non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation and other techniques\n\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation. While the high number of applied pulses used to achieve classical irreversible electroporation may also cause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the current-conducting tissue, non-thermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since it results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and no protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical applications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is technically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of chemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison to other ablation methods such as RF ablation or cryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the connective structure [8, 32]. Since it has been observed that NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves, there is hope of using this technique in treatment of tumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as this treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of ECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure adequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other minimally invasive therapies for treatment of deep-seated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g. high intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation. The latter is a minimally invasive procedure where a needle electrode is inserted percutaneously into a tumor, much as in ECT or NTIRE. The electrode acts as an antenna for electromagnetic waves emitted by a generator; the tumor is heated up and thereby destroyed [34]. As with NTIRE or ECT, the need for accurate needle placement exists and its importance has been evaluated. Success, i.e. improved treatment, has been proven to be correlated to the experience of the operator [34].\n\n### The need for education on electroporation\n\nAs outlined in the paragraphs above, both reversible and irreversible electroporation are promising approaches in treating solid tumors, however their success is highly dependent on local field strength. Poorly defined or unknown properties such as tissue conductivities and inhomogeneities in addition to our choice of electrode type, positions and pulse amplitudes, affect the electric field distribution. With many factors to take into consideration, we may dismiss important uncontrolled variables or use a well-studied but irrelevant model that cannot be applied to a specific situation. An example of this is the persistent use of a very simple approximation for electric field strength that holds only under very particular conditions. This frequently used approximation equates the electric field strength *E* to the voltage *U* applied on the electrodes divided by the distance *d* between the electrodes, i.e. *E* \u2248 *U*\/*d*. Since the local electric field strength has been identified as the key factor in achieving both reversible and irreversible electroporation (see [19] for details), i.e. local *E* has to reach a certain threshold value *E*\nrev or *E*\nirrev, it is the parameter we most often optimize our electrode configuration for. There is a problem, however, since this simple relation is strictly valid only in an isotropic homogeneous medium between two infinitely large parallel plate electrodes. When using parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this simple model best approximates the actual field strength far from the electrode edges, provided the electrode width is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results are even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of course there are no parallel plates to speak of (see Figure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore, using the simple parallel plate approximation for *E* in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result in significant reduction of response in treatment for which the complete response rate has been shown to be as high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way into more and more clinics worldwide [36\u201339] and establishing themselves as safe and effective treatments of cancer, it is becoming more and more important that medical personnel performing and planning ECT (or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action, the underlying physics and possible pitfalls. This paper presents an application for visualization and analysis of the electric field strength in multiple-needle-electrode electroporation aimed at users with basic knowledge of the principles of electroporation, but lack of education in physics and engineering who may therefore need visual, interactive and didactic instruments to gain a deeper understanding of the principles necessary for effective use of these promising treatments. Since educational applications of the sort are scarce and research is focused primarily on advancing the field rather than educating, the need to explore options and applications in this area of engineering education seems pressing and applicative results should be welcome. The application is part of a now firmly established annual course Electroporation Based Technologies and Treatments, EBTT (http:\/\/www.ebtt.org). The e-learning laboratory exercise into which the presented application has been incorporated, has been developed and described previously [40].\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Theoretical background\n\nThe theoretical background for the mathematical engine that is at the heart of our application has been derived from the electrostatic field theory, more specifically, extended from a solution for electrostatic potential generated by two long parallel charged conductors given in [41]. We have omitted the detailed mathematical derivations here as they are outside the scope of this paper; however, we have included a derivation of the equations below in the Appendix for those readers that may be interested in further development or modifications to our model. Below, we specify only the final formulation of the mathematical model and the method of application of this analytical solution into the field-calculating engine that represents the core of Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation (ApiVizTEP), since this is the only essential part of the application around which the user interface is built. Similarly to the approach that we present in this paper, other analytical models have been developed previously using complex analysis. For a six-needle array, one may find a first-order analytical approximation for the electric field strength in [42]. Other authors have expanded on this approach further, see e.g. [43] and [44]; however, these solutions do not give an accurate analytical expression for the electric field strength since quite possibly such a solution cannot be obtained for three or more electrodes active concurrently at a given time. Since currently electroporation devices mostly power only one pair of electrodes at a time [45], we have not pursued a solution with more than two concurrently active electrodes, thus avoiding the derivation of an approximate solution. Instead, we give an accurate solution for a two needle electrode system that is not based (mathematically) on previously published work.\n\nThe accurate analytical solution for electric field strength of two long parallel cylindrical conductors (needle electrodes) on a plane perpendicular to the conductor longitudinal axis (2-D solution), is given by the following equation\n\n*V*\nAB is the voltage on an electrode pair (anode\u2013cathode), *d*\nAB is the distance between the electrodes, *\u03c1*\n0 is the electrode diameter, while *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B are coordinates of the center of the electrode mathematical equivalents (the electrical center *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B of the electrodes is eccentric to the actual geometrical center *x*\nA, *y*\nA and *x*\nB, *y*\nB due to finite i.e. non-zero electrode diameter).\n\nOur application employs a mesh of 400 \u00d7 400 points and the electric field strength *E* is calculated for each of the 160.000 points using the expression above. The time needed to perform the necessary calculations and display the results is practically negligible, ranging from a few hundred milliseconds for two active electrodes up to one and a half seconds for twelve active electrodes using an average modern personal computer, i.e. at least a dual core 2 GHz processor equipped with 2 GB of memory or more. It needs to be emphasized that while the application allows for inclusion of up to twelve electrodes distributed into one to six groups with variable voltages, the application fundamentally breaks down these groups into anode\u2013cathode pairs and calculates the electric field strength by means of the equations above for every pair. It then searches this set of results to obtain the maximum value of the electric field in each of the 160.000 points. This value represents the final solution in that point, since what we are interested in is determining the maximum value for the local field strength. In this way we have eliminated the need for a solution for the electric field of more than two concurrently active electrodes. Such an approach is justified by the fact that we have already mentioned \u2013 i.e. currently electroporation devices only power two electrodes at the same time.\n\n### Tools and platforms\n\nThe application has been written in C# programming language in the Microsoft\u00ae Visual Studio 2010 integrated development environment. The library used was the Microsoft\u00ae .NET Framework version 4.

Electroporation mainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly composed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short and intense electric fields. The physical mechanism responsible for increased permeability is thought to be the formation of nano-scale defects termed *pores* (thus electro*poration*) in the lipid structure [3, 4]. This allows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact mechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is too high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not temporary, but instead result in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversible electroporation. On the other hand, if the cells survive, increased permeability of membrane is only temporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible electroporation. This observed transient increase in permeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of applications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA) delivery, introduction of drugs into cells, fusion of cells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer, gene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of drugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6, 7] for an overview. In these applications viability of the porated cells is important and thus irreversible electroporation is consciously avoided and generally considered to be an undesired side effect. However, there are also interesting medical applications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering the domains of industrial [9, 10] and environmental [11] applications.\n\n### Electrochemotherapy\n\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that successfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs. For successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate amplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and shape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake and hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been identified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13, 14]. The transport of bleomycin across the nonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited [15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and DNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity of bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several thousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is the electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent increase in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to reach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17, 18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be eradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be permeabilized, i.e. all cells in the tumor have to be exposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means that the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends on both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high electric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we must consider before we can confidently assume we have successfully electroporated the entire tumor area. First, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue electrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity compared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric field strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields in the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue of electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their shape, size and position. In general, there are two types of electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate electrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with either a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two plates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively, which ensures good electrical contact, but has other drawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure good electrical contact and optimal distance between electrodes to fit the tumor [21, 22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous and dependent on their diameter, distance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013 the task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even more arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19, 24] and in vivo studies [25] on importance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need for careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted by a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) project, in the scope of which standard operating procedures for ECT were published [26]. However, in advanced cases such as intracranial [27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need for patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29, 30].\n\n### Non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation and other techniques\n\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation. While the high number of applied pulses used to achieve classical irreversible electroporation may also cause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the current-conducting tissue, non-thermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since it results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and no protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical applications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is technically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of chemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison to other ablation methods such as RF ablation or cryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the connective structure [8, 32]. Since it has been observed that NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves, there is hope of using this technique in treatment of tumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as this treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of ECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure adequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other minimally invasive therapies for treatment of deep-seated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g. high intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation. The latter is a minimally invasive procedure where a needle electrode is inserted percutaneously into a tumor, much as in ECT or NTIRE. The electrode acts as an antenna for electromagnetic waves emitted by a generator; the tumor is heated up and thereby destroyed [34]. As with NTIRE or ECT, the need for accurate needle placement exists and its importance has been evaluated. Success, i.e. improved treatment, has been proven to be correlated to the experience of the operator [34].\n\n### The need for education on electroporation\n\nAs outlined in the paragraphs above, both reversible and irreversible electroporation are promising approaches in treating solid tumors, however their success is highly dependent on local field strength. Poorly defined or unknown properties such as tissue conductivities and inhomogeneities in addition to our choice of electrode type, positions and pulse amplitudes, affect the electric field distribution. With many factors to take into consideration, we may dismiss important uncontrolled variables or use a well-studied but irrelevant model that cannot be applied to a specific situation. An example of this is the persistent use of a very simple approximation for electric field strength that holds only under very particular conditions. This frequently used approximation equates the electric field strength *E* to the voltage *U* applied on the electrodes divided by the distance *d* between the electrodes, i.e. *E* \u2248 *U*\/*d*. Since the local electric field strength has been identified as the key factor in achieving both reversible and irreversible electroporation (see [19] for details), i.e. local *E* has to reach a certain threshold value *E*\nrev or *E*\nirrev, it is the parameter we most often optimize our electrode configuration for. There is a problem, however, since this simple relation is strictly valid only in an isotropic homogeneous medium between two infinitely large parallel plate electrodes. When using parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this simple model best approximates the actual field strength far from the electrode edges, provided the electrode width is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results are even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of course there are no parallel plates to speak of (see Figure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore, using the simple parallel plate approximation for *E* in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result in significant reduction of response in treatment for which the complete response rate has been shown to be as high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way into more and more clinics worldwide [36\u201339] and establishing themselves as safe and effective treatments of cancer, it is becoming more and more important that medical personnel performing and planning ECT (or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action, the underlying physics and possible pitfalls. This paper presents an application for visualization and analysis of the electric field strength in multiple-needle-electrode electroporation aimed at users with basic knowledge of the principles of electroporation, but lack of education in physics and engineering who may therefore need visual, interactive and didactic instruments to gain a deeper understanding of the principles necessary for effective use of these promising treatments. Since educational applications of the sort are scarce and research is focused primarily on advancing the field rather than educating, the need to explore options and applications in this area of engineering education seems pressing and applicative results should be welcome. The application is part of a now firmly established annual course Electroporation Based Technologies and Treatments, EBTT (http:\/\/www.ebtt.org). The e-learning laboratory exercise into which the presented application has been incorporated, has been developed and described previously [40].\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Theoretical background\n\nThe theoretical background for the mathematical engine that is at the heart of our application has been derived from the electrostatic field theory, more specifically, extended from a solution for electrostatic potential generated by two long parallel charged conductors given in [41]. We have omitted the detailed mathematical derivations here as they are outside the scope of this paper; however, we have included a derivation of the equations below in the Appendix for those readers that may be interested in further development or modifications to our model. Below, we specify only the final formulation of the mathematical model and the method of application of this analytical solution into the field-calculating engine that represents the core of Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation (ApiVizTEP), since this is the only essential part of the application around which the user interface is built. Similarly to the approach that we present in this paper, other analytical models have been developed previously using complex analysis. For a six-needle array, one may find a first-order analytical approximation for the electric field strength in [42]. Other authors have expanded on this approach further, see e.g. [43] and [44]; however, these solutions do not give an accurate analytical expression for the electric field strength since quite possibly such a solution cannot be obtained for three or more electrodes active concurrently at a given time. Since currently electroporation devices mostly power only one pair of electrodes at a time [45], we have not pursued a solution with more than two concurrently active electrodes, thus avoiding the derivation of an approximate solution. Instead, we give an accurate solution for a two needle electrode system that is not based (mathematically) on previously published work.\n\nThe accurate analytical solution for electric field strength of two long parallel cylindrical conductors (needle electrodes) on a plane perpendicular to the conductor longitudinal axis (2-D solution), is given by the following equation\n\n*V*\nAB is the voltage on an electrode pair (anode\u2013cathode), *d*\nAB is the distance between the electrodes, *\u03c1*\n0 is the electrode diameter, while *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B are coordinates of the center of the electrode mathematical equivalents (the electrical center *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B of the electrodes is eccentric to the actual geometrical center *x*\nA, *y*\nA and *x*\nB, *y*\nB due to finite i.e. non-zero electrode diameter).\n\nOur application employs a mesh of 400 \u00d7 400 points and the electric field strength *E* is calculated for each of the 160.000 points using the expression above. The time needed to perform the necessary calculations and display the results is practically negligible, ranging from a few hundred milliseconds for two active electrodes up to one and a half seconds for twelve active electrodes using an average modern personal computer, i.e. at least a dual core 2 GHz processor equipped with 2 GB of memory or more. It needs to be emphasized that while the application allows for inclusion of up to twelve electrodes distributed into one to six groups with variable voltages, the application fundamentally breaks down these groups into anode\u2013cathode pairs and calculates the electric field strength by means of the equations above for every pair. It then searches this set of results to obtain the maximum value of the electric field in each of the 160.000 points. This value represents the final solution in that point, since what we are interested in is determining the maximum value for the local field strength. In this way we have eliminated the need for a solution for the electric field of more than two concurrently active electrodes. Such an approach is justified by the fact that we have already mentioned \u2013 i.e. currently electroporation devices only power two electrodes at the same time.\n\n### Tools and platforms\n\nThe application has been written in C# programming language in the Microsoft\u00ae Visual Studio 2010 integrated development environment. The library used was the Microsoft\u00ae .NET Framework version 4. The development environment and base library have both been selected based on personal preference and possibilities that are enabled by the enhancements in these tools concerning ease of graphical user interface (GUI) development by separating the markup that describes the GUI elements from programming logic that provides the functionality.\n\nThe internet version of the application is hosted on a semi-open platform, since a Microsoft\u00ae Windows operating system is hosting an Apache\u2122 HTTP Server web server with installed PHP support and a free edition of Oracle\u00ae MySQL, providing a web interface to basically the same, though slightly modified and recompiled, engine as in the desktop version.\n\n## Results\n\nThe application that we developed has been named Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation, or ApiVizTEP in short.

Instead, we give an accurate solution for a two needle electrode system that is not based (mathematically) on previously published work.\n\nThe accurate analytical solution for electric field strength of two long parallel cylindrical conductors (needle electrodes) on a plane perpendicular to the conductor longitudinal axis (2-D solution), is given by the following equation\n\n*V*\nAB is the voltage on an electrode pair (anode\u2013cathode), *d*\nAB is the distance between the electrodes, *\u03c1*\n0 is the electrode diameter, while *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B are coordinates of the center of the electrode mathematical equivalents (the electrical center *x*\u2019A, *y*\u2019A and *x*\u2019B, *y*\u2019B of the electrodes is eccentric to the actual geometrical center *x*\nA, *y*\nA and *x*\nB, *y*\nB due to finite i.e. non-zero electrode diameter).\n\nOur application employs a mesh of 400 \u00d7 400 points and the electric field strength *E* is calculated for each of the 160.000 points using the expression above. The time needed to perform the necessary calculations and display the results is practically negligible, ranging from a few hundred milliseconds for two active electrodes up to one and a half seconds for twelve active electrodes using an average modern personal computer, i.e. at least a dual core 2 GHz processor equipped with 2 GB of memory or more. It needs to be emphasized that while the application allows for inclusion of up to twelve electrodes distributed into one to six groups with variable voltages, the application fundamentally breaks down these groups into anode\u2013cathode pairs and calculates the electric field strength by means of the equations above for every pair. It then searches this set of results to obtain the maximum value of the electric field in each of the 160.000 points. This value represents the final solution in that point, since what we are interested in is determining the maximum value for the local field strength. In this way we have eliminated the need for a solution for the electric field of more than two concurrently active electrodes.

The success of this treatment is highly dependent on parameters such as tissue electrical properties, applied voltages and spatial relations in placement of electrodes that are used to establish a cell-permeabilizing electric field in target tissue. Non-thermal irreversible electroporation techniques for ablation of tissue depend similarly on these parameters. In the treatment planning stage, if oversimplified approximations for evaluation of electric field are used, such as U\/d (voltage-to-distance ratio), sufficient field strength may not be reached within the entire target (tumor) area, potentially resulting in treatment failure.\n\n### Results\n\nIn order to provide an aid in education of medical personnel performing electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation, assist in visualizing the electric field in needle electrode electroporation and the effects of changes in electrode placement, an application has been developed both as a desktop- and a web-based solution. It enables users to position up to twelve electrodes in a plane of adjustable dimensions representing a two-dimensional slice of tissue. By means of manipulation of electrode placement, i.e. repositioning, and the changes in electrical parameters, the users interact with the system and observe the resulting electrical field strength established by the inserted electrodes in real time. The field strength is calculated and visualized online and instantaneously reflects the desired changes, dramatically improving the user friendliness and educational value, especially compared to approaches utilizing general-purpose numerical modeling software, such as finite element modeling packages.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we outline the need and offer a solution in medical education in the field of electroporation-based treatments, e.g. primarily electrochemotherapy and non-thermal irreversible tissue ablation. We present the background, the means of implementation and the fully functional application, which is the first of its kind. While the initial feedback from students that have evaluated this application as part of an e-learning course is positive, a formal study is planned to thoroughly evaluate the current version and identify possible future improvements and modifications.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n\n## Background\n\n### Electroporation\n\nElectroporation is a term coined in the early 1980's [1] for phenomena already described more than a decade earlier [2], when an interesting property of biological membranes has been observed. Electroporation mainly results in transient increase in membrane permeability when these membranes \u2013 which are mainly composed of lipid bilayers \u2013 are exposed to very short and intense electric fields. The physical mechanism responsible for increased permeability is thought to be the formation of nano-scale defects termed *pores* (thus electro*poration*) in the lipid structure [3, 4]. This allows molecules that usually do not cross the membrane to cross it with relative ease, though the exact mechanism of this transport remains a subject of scientific debate [5]. In case the electric field strength is too high, changes to membrane structures and consequently to the cell are not temporary, but instead result in cell death, a phenomenon known as irreversible electroporation. On the other hand, if the cells survive, increased permeability of membrane is only temporary and the phenomenon is termed reversible electroporation. This observed transient increase in permeability of electroporated membranes of biological cells has offered opportunities for extensive research and development resulting in a number of applications of electroporation, such as gene (DNA) delivery, introduction of drugs into cells, fusion of cells, electrochemotherapy for treatment of cancer, gene delivery in tissue and transdermal delivery of drugs and genes as well as a number of other applications, see for instance [6, 7] for an overview. In these applications viability of the porated cells is important and thus irreversible electroporation is consciously avoided and generally considered to be an undesired side effect. However, there are also interesting medical applications of irreversible electroporation [8], such as non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation. Irreversible electroporation is also rapidly entering the domains of industrial [9, 10] and environmental [11] applications.\n\n### Electrochemotherapy\n\nElectrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local treatment that successfully combines application of cell-membrane-permeabilizing electric pulses and chemotherapeutic drugs. For successful ECT, the pulses must be of adequate amplitude, duration, number, repetition frequency and shape [12], in order to achieve local increase in uptake and hence cytotoxicity of otherwise non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs. Two drugs have been identified as candidates for ECT: bleomycin and cisplatin [13, 14]. The transport of bleomycin across the nonpermeabilized plasma membrane is highly limited [15]. Using electroporation to increase membrane permeability provides bleomycin with access to cytosol and DNA, where it causes DNA breakdown. The cytotoxicity of bleomycin is thereby increased by a factor of several thousand [16]. In short, the main mechanism of ECT is the electroporation of cells in tumors and consequent increase in drug effectiveness by enabling the drug to reach intracellular targets. For other supporting mechanisms, see [17, 18].\n\nSince all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be eradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be permeabilized, i.e. all cells in the tumor have to be exposed to appropriate electric pulses. This means that the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy depends on both the drug availability in the tumor and coverage of the whole target area by a sufficiently high electric field [19].\n\nThere are several factors in ECT of tumors that we must consider before we can confidently assume we have successfully electroporated the entire tumor area. First, there is the issue of tumor and surrounding tissue electrical properties that may exhibit considerable inhomogeneity. Conductivity is of particularly high importance for example, since higher tumor conductivity compared to surrounding tissue results in lower electric field strength in the tumor and undesirably high fields in the surrounding healthy area that may cause irreversible electroporation [20]. Second, there is the issue of electrodes used to apply the pulses, mainly of their shape, size and position. In general, there are two types of electrodes \u2013 plate and needle electrodes. Plate electrodes are non-invasive, usually parallel and with either a fixed or adjustable distance in between the two plates, whereas needle electrodes are used invasively, which ensures good electrical contact, but has other drawbacks. In using plate electrodes, we must ensure good electrical contact and optimal distance between electrodes to fit the tumor [21, 22] and with needle electrodes \u2013 since electric field distribution is more inhomogeneous and dependent on their diameter, distance between them and depth of insertion [23] \u2013 the task of ensuring entire tumor area coverage is even more arduous [19].\n\nSeveral papers have been published based on numerical modeling, e.g. [19, 24] and in vivo studies [25] on importance of tumor coverage by sufficiently high electric fields for successful ECT, demonstrating the need for careful consideration and control of variables. Effectiveness of ECT has been confirmed in a study conducted by a consortium of four medical institutions gathered in the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) project, in the scope of which standard operating procedures for ECT were published [26]. However, in advanced cases such as intracranial [27] or liver metastasis tumor treatment [28], the need for patient-specific treatment planning has been highlighted and is being developed [29, 30].\n\n### Non-thermal irreversible electroporation for tissue ablation and other techniques\n\nIrreversible electroporation has been studied extensively in recent years as a method of tissue ablation. While the high number of applied pulses used to achieve classical irreversible electroporation may also cause thermal damages due to Joule heating of the current-conducting tissue, non-thermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) is of particular interest since it results in well-defined areas of tissue ablation and no protein coagulation [31]. The potential clinical applications of NTIRE are therefore numerous. It is technically a simple procedure, requiring only the insertion of electrode needles without any addition of chemotherapeutic as with ECT; it is fast in comparison to other ablation methods such as RF ablation or cryoablation; can be monitored with ultrasound; produces a sharp delineation between treated and untreated regions; and affects only cells while sparing the connective structure [8, 32]. Since it has been observed that NTIRE spares the vascular structure and nerves, there is hope of using this technique in treatment of tumors abutting large blood vessels [33]. Promising as this treatment is, we are faced with similar considerations as with reversible electroporation in the case of ECT or its many other applications, namely to ensure adequate local electric field strength, sufficient for irreversible, yet non-thermal electroporation.\n\nIn addition to NTIRE and ECT, a number of other minimally invasive therapies for treatment of deep-seated tumors (particularly those of the liver) exist, e.g. high intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation. The latter is a minimally invasive procedure where a needle electrode is inserted percutaneously into a tumor, much as in ECT or NTIRE. The electrode acts as an antenna for electromagnetic waves emitted by a generator; the tumor is heated up and thereby destroyed [34]. As with NTIRE or ECT, the need for accurate needle placement exists and its importance has been evaluated. Success, i.e. improved treatment, has been proven to be correlated to the experience of the operator [34].\n\n### The need for education on electroporation\n\nAs outlined in the paragraphs above, both reversible and irreversible electroporation are promising approaches in treating solid tumors, however their success is highly dependent on local field strength. Poorly defined or unknown properties such as tissue conductivities and inhomogeneities in addition to our choice of electrode type, positions and pulse amplitudes, affect the electric field distribution. With many factors to take into consideration, we may dismiss important uncontrolled variables or use a well-studied but irrelevant model that cannot be applied to a specific situation. An example of this is the persistent use of a very simple approximation for electric field strength that holds only under very particular conditions. This frequently used approximation equates the electric field strength *E* to the voltage *U* applied on the electrodes divided by the distance *d* between the electrodes, i.e. *E* \u2248 *U*\/*d*. Since the local electric field strength has been identified as the key factor in achieving both reversible and irreversible electroporation (see [19] for details), i.e. local *E* has to reach a certain threshold value *E*\nrev or *E*\nirrev, it is the parameter we most often optimize our electrode configuration for. There is a problem, however, since this simple relation is strictly valid only in an isotropic homogeneous medium between two infinitely large parallel plate electrodes. When using parallel plate electrodes in ECT or NTIRE, this simple model best approximates the actual field strength far from the electrode edges, provided the electrode width is sufficiently large compared to the electrode distance. In any case, the approximate model fails completely as we approach the edges (see Figure 1a). Results are even worse in the case of needle electrodes, where of course there are no parallel plates to speak of (see Figure 1b and [35] for further elucidation). Therefore, using the simple parallel plate approximation for *E* in individual cases of tumor treatment could possibly result in significant reduction of response in treatment for which the complete response rate has been shown to be as high as 74% [17].\n\nAs ECT and NTIRE are steadily finding their way into more and more clinics worldwide [36\u201339] and establishing themselves as safe and effective treatments of cancer, it is becoming more and more important that medical personnel performing and planning ECT (or NTIRE) is aware of their mechanisms of action, the underlying physics and possible pitfalls. This paper presents an application for visualization and analysis of the electric field strength in multiple-needle-electrode electroporation aimed at users with basic knowledge of the principles of electroporation, but lack of education in physics and engineering who may therefore need visual, interactive and didactic instruments to gain a deeper understanding of the principles necessary for effective use of these promising treatments. Since educational applications of the sort are scarce and research is focused primarily on advancing the field rather than educating, the need to explore options and applications in this area of engineering education seems pressing and applicative results should be welcome. The application is part of a now firmly established annual course Electroporation Based Technologies and Treatments, EBTT (http:\/\/www.ebtt.org). The e-learning laboratory exercise into which the presented application has been incorporated, has been developed and described previously [40].\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Theoretical background\n\nThe theoretical background for the mathematical engine that is at the heart of our application has been derived from the electrostatic field theory, more specifically, extended from a solution for electrostatic potential generated by two long parallel charged conductors given in [41]. We have omitted the detailed mathematical derivations here as they are outside the scope of this paper; however, we have included a derivation of the equations below in the Appendix for those readers that may be interested in further development or modifications to our model. Below, we specify only the final formulation of the mathematical model and the method of application of this analytical solution into the field-calculating engine that represents the core of Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation (ApiVizTEP), since this is the only essential part of the application around which the user interface is built. Similarly to the approach that we present in this paper, other analytical models have been developed previously using complex analysis. For a six-needle array, one may find a first-order analytical approximation for the electric field strength in [42]. Other authors have expanded on this approach further, see e.g. [43] and [44]; however, these solutions do not give an accurate analytical expression for the electric field strength since quite possibly such a solution cannot be obtained for three or more electrodes active concurrently at a given time. Since currently electroporation devices mostly power only one pair of electrodes at a time [45], we have not pursued a solution with more than two concurrently active electrodes, thus avoiding the derivation of an approximate solution.

The time needed to perform the necessary calculations and display the results is practically negligible, ranging from a few hundred milliseconds for two active electrodes up to one and a half seconds for twelve active electrodes using an average modern personal computer, i.e. at least a dual core 2 GHz processor equipped with 2 GB of memory or more. It needs to be emphasized that while the application allows for inclusion of up to twelve electrodes distributed into one to six groups with variable voltages, the application fundamentally breaks down these groups into anode\u2013cathode pairs and calculates the electric field strength by means of the equations above for every pair.

It can worsen for 6 months after treatment, and last several months after you stop taking oxaliplatin. Nerves take a very long time to heal. Here's a rule of thumb: If you had 6 months of treatment with oxaliplatin, it may take 12 months for the nerves to heal.\nQ: What is the most neurotoxic chemotherapy?\nA: Toxicity to the peripheral nervous system is the major dose-limiting toxicity of at least some of the platinum drugs of clinical interest. Among the platinum compounds in clinical use, cisplatin is the most neurotoxic, inducing mainly sensory neuropathy of the upper and lower extremities.\nQ: What percentage of patients on oxaliplatin have neuropathy?\nA: It is estimated that 65%\u201398% of chemotherapy patients receiving oxaliplatin develop peripheral neuropathy (Cavaletti and Marmiroli, 2020).

Among the platinum compounds in clinical use, cisplatin is the most neurotoxic, inducing mainly sensory neuropathy of the upper and lower extremities.\nQ: Can chemotherapy cause neurotoxicity?\nA: Many widely used chemotherapy drugs, including platinum-based agents (oxaliplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin), taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine), proteasome inhibitors, and thalidomide analogues may cause direct neurotoxicity and CIPN (Zaj\u0105czkowska et al., 2019).\nQ: Can chemotherapy cause erythema?\nA: Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema, also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or hand-foot syndrome is reddening, swelling, numbness and desquamation (skin sloughing or peeling) on palms of the hands and soles of the feet (and, occasionally, on the knees, elbows, and elsewhere) that can occur after chemotherapy ...","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_mIqX2UN5EsNj3b5Vpo3yt3eY\",

It is mainly responsible for ejecting ink at high speed when the inkjet printer is working so that it can form an image on the printing medium. Common printheads of inkjet printers mainly include **thermal (heat-sensitive) printheads** and **piezoelectric printheads**.\n\nPiezoelectric printheads refer to printheads made of special crystal materials that can sensitively respond to voltage. The key component of the piezoelectric inkjet printhead is the piezoelectric element. The current signal controls the deformation of the piezoelectric element, thereby ejecting the accumulated ink, which can more accurately control the size and ejection direction of the ink droplets, ensuring precise control of the ink. Micro-piezoelectric printheads are different from thermal foam printheads. Since the entire ink ejection process is completed at room temperature and does not require heating, in principle piezoelectric printheads are more durable than thermal foam printheads. In fact, the same is true above.\n\n### Piezoelectric Printhead Structure\n\nThe key part of piezoelectric inkjet technology is the **piezoelectric printhead**. The piezoelectric printhead consists of piezoelectric material nozzles and ink storage chambers. The nozzle hole is a channel that connects the ink storage chamber and the printing medium. The ink storage chamber stores ink. Piezoelectric materials are responsible for producing the piezoelectric effect. The **piezoelectric effect** refers to the phenomenon that certain crystals will produce charge separation under the action of external force. Specifically, when force or pressure is applied, the positive and negative charges inside the crystal will separate, resulting in a charge difference and a potential difference. This phenomenon is called the positive piezoelectric effect. When opposing force or pressure is applied, the potential difference is reversed, which is known as the negative piezoelectric effect.\n\n*Epson XP600 Print Head Brand New with Adapter*\n\n### Piezoelectric Inkjet Printing Technology\n\n**Piezoelectric inkjet printing technology** is a technology commonly used in inkjet printers. The main manufacturer is Epson. It uses the piezoelectric effect to eject ink to achieve printing functions. This article will introduce the working principle of piezoelectric inkjet technology from a principle perspective. In the following parts, JOHOPE Technology will introduce this printing technology.\n\nHow does Piezoelectric Inkjet Printing Technology Work?\n\n1. Ink supply\n\nBefore starting work, ink is first supplied to the ink storage chamber of the inkjet head. The ink storage chamber has an ink channel connected to the ink supply system, and the ink is sent into the ink storage chamber through a pressure difference. The ink in the ink storage chamber is kept under constant pressure to ensure the stability of the inkjet.\n\n2. Signal transmission\n\nAfter the printing task starts, the computer will transmit the printing data to the inkjet printer control system. The control system generates corresponding control signals based on the printing data and transmits them to the piezoelectric inkjet head through a **cable**.\n\n3. Piezoelectric effect\n\nWhen the control signal is transmitted to the piezoelectric inkjet head, the piezoelectric material is acted upon by voltage, producing a piezoelectric effect. The action of voltage causes the piezoelectric material to deform, causing the piezoelectric material to shrink or stretch, thereby changing the size of the nozzle hole.\n\n*Inkjet printer with piezoelectric printhead*\n\n4. Ink jet\n\nThe deformation of the piezoelectric material causes changes in the size of the nozzle holes. When the nozzle holes shrink, the ink will be pushed out of the nozzle holes, forming ink droplets. After the ink droplets pass through the nozzle holes, they are dispersed into small ink droplets by the electric field and are fired toward the printing medium at high speed.\n\n5. Control Accuracy\n\nIn order to ensure the accuracy and clarity of printing, the control system needs to accurately control the deformation of the piezoelectric material. By changing the voltage and frequency of the control signal, the deformation degree of the piezoelectric material can be adjusted, thereby achieving the control accuracy of the inkjet.\n\n### Advantages of Piezoelectric Inkjet Printing Technology\n\nPiezoelectric inkjet printing technology has a stronger ability to control ink droplets, and the shape of the ink droplets is more regular, the positioning is more accurate, the printing resolution is higher, and high-precision printing is easily achieved. In addition, piezoelectric inkjet printing technology does not require heating of ink, and the ink will not undergo chemical changes due to heat, which expands the range of ink choices and extends the life of the inkjet print head. Because the temperature during inkjet printing is in a constant and stable state, the viscosity and surface tension of the ink remain relatively stable after a long period of uninterrupted printing, thus ensuring the consistency of print quality and the color of customer reprints. Represent unity.\n\nCeramic piezoelectric inkjet printing systems can print almost any kind of ink, including water-based and solvent-based. The ink used for piezoelectric inkjet printing has a wide range of viscosity and surface tension options and has solubility and quick-drying properties. The viscosity can be between 1-20 mPa.s, and the tension can be between 30~50mN\/m. Therefore, piezoelectric inkjet printing technology makes up for the shortcomings of **thermal foaming inkjet printing technology** and has a wider application space.\n\nIn addition, the nozzle and **ink cartridge** in the piezoelectric inkjet print head are independent structures. One nozzle can support multiple ink cartridges. When replacing ink, you only need to replace the ink cartridge instead of the print head, which can save part of the cost of printing consumables.\n\n### Disadvantages of Piezoelectric Inkjet Printing Technology\n\nThe biggest disadvantage of piezoelectric inkjet printing technology is that it is difficult to concentrate a larger number of nozzles on one print head, so the printing speed will be slower. The cost of inkjet printheads made with piezoelectric technology will also be relatively high, and once damaged, it will be relatively expensive to repair.\n\nAnother disadvantage is that piezoelectric inkjet printing technology wastes a lot of ink when printing. When the printer nozzle is clogged, a large amount of ink needs to be wasted to clean the nozzle. Every time the nozzle is replaced, 30% of the ink must be wasted first for ink head cleaning. , it takes 2 to 3 minutes to clean every time it is turned on, and some ink is wasted. When the air volume sensing device requires the user to replace the ink cartridge, there is still about 20% of ink remaining in the ink cartridge.\n\nIn addition, JOHOPE Technology analyzes another printing technology-thermal foaming inkjet printing technology.

Because it is additive, it enables geometries usually unattainable by other technologies. Because it is digitally controlled, its output is easily modulated, even during operation. Combined with the development of functional materials and their micrometer precision, it can be applicable in a wide range of fields beyond the traditional graphic industry, such as medical diagnosis, electronics manufacturing, and the fabrication of microlenses. In this work, a solution based on open-source hardware and software was implemented instead of choosing a commercial alternative, making the most of inkjet flexibility in terms of inks, substrates, and actuation signal. First, a piezoelectric printhead from MicroFab, driven by an ArduinoDue, was mounted in a 3D printer adapted to ensure precise movement in three dimensions. Then, a monitoring system using a USB digital microscope and a computational algorithm was integrated. Both systems combined allow the printing and measurement of microdroplets by digital regulation of a unipolar signal. Finally, based on a theoretical model and a set of experimentally collected samples, the curve that relates the unipolar signal amplitude to the size of the microdroplets was estimated with an acceptable range of prediction uncertainty.\n\n**Keywords:** inkjet model, open-source, continuous light visualization, microdroplet tracking, customizable setup\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) encompasses technologies that are based on the creation of objects (two or three dimensional) through the deposition of material layer-by-layer. Inkjet printing, in particular, creates precise patterns by depositing consecutive droplets at the micrometer scale. Because it is additive and contactless, it has the ability to deposit material in areas of difficult access, over non-homogeneous surfaces, and to create complex geometries. Moreover, its additive quality makes it environmentally friendly, likely more economic, and requires fewer processing steps. Because it is digitally controlled, it can be easily customized and corrected during operation [1,2]. In recent years, new functional inks and deposition substrates to be used in inkjet techniques have been explored, envisioning novel applications in fields such as medicine, electronics, or optics [3,4,5].\n\nIn inkjet printing, the ejection of the droplets is accomplished by applying pressure to a fluid inside the printhead chamber through the nozzle, with the size and velocity of such droplets regulated by the magnitude and evolution of this applied pressure. In the particular case of piezoelectric printheads, this pressure is achieved by expanding and compressing the chamber with a piezo actuator whose deformation, in turn, is regulated by an electrical driving waveform. Therefore, manipulating the droplet characteristics entails manipulating the driving waveform. For piezoelectric printheads, the impact of the driving waveform on the ejected droplet during fly has been widely studied [6,7,8], whereas less focus has been put on the direct relationship between the size of the resulting printed droplet. Reference [9] presents a model that relates the amplitude of the input signal of a solenoid valve that actuates the printhead directly with the diameter of the printed droplets, thus allowing a feedback control of the millimeter width of the printed line in terms of the input signal. Using the fact that both the solenoid valve signal and piezoelectric printheads have a proportional relationship between the amplitude of the actuation signal and the droplet volume, this model will be used and validated on the micrometer scale.\n\nDespite a market existing for the production of inkjet printing equipment, commercial alternatives can be expensive and less prone to customization. Today, the application of open-source solutions in experimental research has proven to be an attractive alternative. Although these solutions do not guarantee the reliability ensured by commercial equipment, they allow the modeling of a system tailored to the specific requirements of the research, enable the readjustment of such a system during the research evolution, and have a more attractive cost [10]. Moreover, the ability to reuse existing equipment according to new needs is specifically convenient given the current equipment shortages and long delivery times associated with commercial solutions, not to mention today\u2019s environmental concerns.\n\nThis work focuses on the implementation and characterization of equipment that meets the operating requirements associated with micrometer inkjet printing while keeping it highly customizable. Its major contributions are as follows. First, an accessible and modular solution for accurate inkjet printing mainly based on open-source hardware and software was developed. By using a 3D printer with microstepping drivers, the sought micrometer, and smooth displacement on the three axes is achieved. The use of an Arduino Due connected with a driver circuit for the printhead actuation assures a 1 microsecond resolution when designing the waveform and the required output voltage range without being limited to upfront wave designs or operation configurations that could be fixed on commercial alternatives. Moreover, not only are both equipment, Arduino Due and the 3D printer, easily acquired, but the fact that their code and hardware are known makes it possible to adapt them seamlessly, namely, enabling the integration of sensors or the extraction of information that seems relevant, as well as accepting inputs in the desired format and through convenient channels. The present solution allows both Arduino Due and the 3D printer to be updated from any type of external command through a serial port. The second achievement consists of the implementation of a monitoring system that keeps track of the printing in contrast with the traditional approach of stroboscopic light. To visually monitor the evolution of the printing patterns and evaluate the system performance, a USB microscope and a computational algorithm are integrated, providing real-time information on the printing at the micrometer scale. Finally, a model of the implemented system is presented, allowing the manipulation of the characteristics of the printed droplet as a function of the printhead actuation signal. Knowing that both solenoid valve signal and piezoelectric printheads are controlled with a proportional relationship between the amplitude of the actuation signal and the droplet volume, the model was validated on a tenth of a micrometer scale, which is 100 times smaller than previously reported.\n\n## 2. Physics of Inkjet Printing\n\nThe physical concepts underlying the formation of droplets, using a piezoelectric printhead, and their deposition on the substrate are overviewed in this Section.\n\n### 2.1. Droplet Formation: Driving Waveform\n\nFigure 1a shows a tubular printing chamber surrounded by a tubular piezoelectric actuator, with which it moves accordingly. The inner and outer surfaces of the piezo are each bound to an electrode, through which the driving waveform is applied. The fluid chamber is connected to a fluid reservoir on the left side and develops into a small orifice on the right side. The fluid is maintained inside the fluid chamber due to surface tension.\n\nThe stages of the formation of a droplet are explained for a unipolar pulse as a driving waveform (Figure 1b). When the voltage increases, the chamber expands along with the piezo, creating a negative pressure inside the fluid chamber. Whereas toward the nozzle, this pressure cannot be propagated, in the opposite direction, it results in the fluid being pulled from the reservoir (first stage). While the voltage is maintained constant, nothing happens apart from the propagation of these pressure waves. When the voltage decreases, the chamber is compressed, thus creating a positive pressure inside the fluid chamber (second stage). If well synchronized, the compression and incoming fluid combined may achieve enough energy to overcome the surface tension at the nozzle and eject a droplet (third stage) [11,12].\n\nThe resulting droplet will depend on the applied pulse characteristics. The impact of each pulse parameter is detailed below [6,8,13].\n\n*Pulse amplitude*defines how much energy is used to deform the printhead. It has been observed experimentally that the volume and the velocity of the ejected droplets are proportional to the applied voltage [6,7]. Nevertheless, too much energy may lead to ligament formation and the appearance of unwanted satellites.*Pulse width*specifies how much time is spent between expansion and compression. Ideally, the pressure wave generated by the compression of the piezo must match the reflected pressure wave generated by its expansion. Any mismatch results in less energy being devoted to ejecting the droplet than is actually available. It has been observed that both the droplet volume and velocity have a near quadratic relationship with the pulse width [6,7,14].*Pulse frequency*does not have a direct impact on drop formation. Its impact may emerge when the printing is fast enough (less than 100 s between drops, according to [15]) that residual vibrations from previous drops interfere with the dynamics of the subsequent drops.\n\nAlthough easy to customize by tailoring the driving waveform, within some limits, the resulting drop characteristics highly depend on the used printhead geometry as well as the fluid rheology, mainly surface tension and viscosity [7,16,17].\n\n### 2.2. Droplet Deposition\n\nWhen the ejected drop reaches the substrate, a transient phase occurs after the impact. The deposit drop spreads and retracts, dissipating energy until it reaches its equilibrium [18,19]. The size of the printed drop depends on the volume of the ejected droplet and the equilibrium contact angle resulting from the fluid and substrate interaction. Equation (1) translates the relationship between the volume of the falling drop and the diameter of the printed drop [20].\n\n| (1) |\n\nwhere is the diameter of the falling droplet, *d* is the diameter of the printed droplet, and is the contact angle.\n\n### 2.3. Theoretical Model\n\nIn this work, the approach described in [9] is used to mimic the behavior of the printed drops as a function of the amplitude of the actuating pulse. As explained in Section 2.1, the actuating pulse amplitude, *A*, has a proportional effect on the droplet volume. Considering that the contact angle, , is constant for the same fluid and substrate, then the relationship between printed diameter and applied amplitude becomes:\n\n| (2) |\n\nwhere *B* and *c* are constant parameters . The parameters *B* and *c* are estimated in order to draw the curves that best express the observed experimental data from the implemented system.\n\n## 3. Experimental Setup\n\nTwo main systems were developed to fulfill different goals. The printing system ensures the ejection of droplets on a micrometer scale. The monitoring system allows the identification and measurement of these printed droplets as they are deposited. In Figure 2, the main elements of the experimental setup that is used are shown. A detailed list of the equipment used can be found in the Supplementary Materials (Table S1 and Figure S1). The programs developed are available at the GitHub repository link (see Supplementary Materials Section).\n\n### 3.1. Printing System\n\nThe *printhead* is the main tool for accomplishing microdroplet printing. In this work, a MicroFab MJ-AT-01-050-8MX piezoelectrically actuated printhead (MicroFab, Planto, TX, USA) [21] with a 50 m orifice is used.\n\nThe *drive electronics* to generate the driving waveform are devised to have the ability to modulate an arbitrary driving waveform within a voltage range of [; 70] V and a signal resolution of s. The Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) of an Arduino Due (Arduino, Somerville, MA, USA) draws the arbitrary driving waveform, and a driver circuit amplifies this signal to the power required by the printhead. Both Arduino and the driver have their own power supply of 12 and 65 V, respectively. The wire connections between the various components are portrayed in Figures S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Materials.\n\n**Waveform Generation:** Based on the solution presented in [22], the code was adapted to allow implementing changes in the pulse length (\u201cP_WIDTH\u201d), the pulse amplitude (\u201cV_HIGH\u201d), and the pulse period (\u201csamples\u201d) during the printing routine via serial port. The driving waveform update is depicted in Figure 3a. In this study, the unipolar signal is used, but alternative wave shapes were tested with success.\n\n**Signal amplification:** A driver circuit using a double op-amp PA79 (Apex Microtechnology, Tucson, AZ, USA) [23,24] is used to amplify and shift the Arduino Due tailored waveform. The signal applied across the piezo actuator (Figure 3c and Figure S3) is the difference between the two symmetrical amplifications of the Arduino Due signal (Figure 3b). The schematic of the implemented APEX circuit is shown in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Materials.\n\nThe *fluidic circuit* is responsible for delivering the fluid to the printhead and should be kept at a required operating back pressure to achieve efficient droplet formation. The dispensed fluid used in this project is filtered water and is stored in a 20 mL capacity glass reservoir connected to the printhead by a PTFE tube and PEEK fitting (MicroFab, Planto, TX, USA). The pressure inside the fluidic circuit should guarantee that the fluid is flush at the printhead orifice in equilibrium, which happens with negative hydrostatic pressure, namely [; ] Pa with respect to the surrounding atmospheric pressure, which is accomplished by venting the reservoir to atmospheric pressure and placing the fluid level inside it between [20; 25] mm underneath the printhead orifice level (Figure 4a).\n\n### 3.2. Monitoring System\n\nA Universal Serial Bus (USB) Jiusion Digital Microscope (Jiusion, Nanjing, China) and Matlab software (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) are used to acquire the droplet images and analyze them.\n\nThe *camera* is mounted on the same platform that moves the printhead, as depicted in Figure 4b. To achieve the maximum magnification, the working distance is set at cm, resulting in a field of view of \u00d7 mm. To correct the geometric distortion, a projection transformation matrix is computed to map every point of the captured frame to the equivalent disposition as if the camera was perpendicular to the printing plane. This matrix is computed by comparing the same grid image, taken on both planes, inclined and perpendicular. With the camera moving, a compromise between speed and sharpness emerges, so the travel speed is limited to 15 mm\/min in order to obtain sharp images.\n\nThe *algorithm* devised to identify and measure the printed droplets can be divided into four stages: (1) acquisition; (2) preprocessing; (3) processing, and (4) analysis. The acquisition conditions and the computer vision techniques applied in the algorithm are now detailed.\n\n**Image acquisition:** The Digital Microscope is connected via a serial port and triggered through Matlab with an acquisition frequency of 6 frames per second (fps). The main drawbacks present in the captured images are a reflection on most of the droplet central area and the lack of sharpness due to movement (Figure 5a).\n\n**Image preprocessing:** The captured image is arranged in order to better fit the processes that follow. These arrangements consist of subtracting the image background, converting the image to grayscale, applying the transformation matrix to correct the distortion, and cropping the image to focus on the sub-area containing the printed droplet (Figure 5b).\n\n**Image processing:** The image is processed in order to enhance the droplet for future detection. Each image pixel brightness is multiplied by a factor of 10 to enhance the droplet, followed by a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 3 to mitigate the noise (Figure 5c). This proved to be the best combination to correctly identify the droplet in the image analysis stage, with the impact of each technique portrayed in Figure 6.\n\n**Image analysis:** The goal of this analysis phase is to locate the printed droplet and estimate its radius. In order to mitigate the fact that the printed drops do not have perfect geometry, the function *imfindcircles()* [25] is used. The implemented algorithm in such a function is the Circular Hough Transfom (CHT), which looks for gradient arrangements in the image that suggest circular shapes [26], and presents the most likely centers, their radii and their metric (value from 0 to 1, which represents the confidence of each estimation). The three output arrays, radii, centers, and metric, are ordered by descending metric. For each analyzed image, only one droplet is printed, so only the estimated circle with the highest metric is considered a possible droplet candidate (Figure 5d).\n\nIn this work, performance is understood as (1) precision, i.e., the low dispersion of the measurements for droplets of the same size; and (2) robustness, i.e., the ability to identify the droplets in less than ideal conditions, such as with poorly cylindrical shape or interrupted edge. The CTH input and output parameter combination that yields the best algorithm performance in detecting and measuring the droplets is considered to be the following:\n\nObject Polarity: bright. Defines that a possible droplet should be bright on a dark background, eliminating the reflection inside the droplet as a candidate.\n\nEdge Threshold: 0. Sets the lowest gradient that an edge must have to be considered a possible circle border; a low threshold is used to ensure that the upper edge is less evident due to the reflection inside the droplet and is not dismissed.\n\nRadius range: previous radius +\/ pixels. Abrupt changes in the droplet radius are not applied in this work, so the search is set to depend on the last measured drop within a radius interval, reducing the required memory space and time consumption. Nevertheless, this interval should be large enough to avoid the search getting stuck at a local minimum and be able to promptly track changes in the size of the droplet within the variations practiced in our tests.\n\nSensitivity: 1. Quantifies how selective the algorithm is about possible candidates for circle centers; a high value is used to not discard less evident or round droplets.\n\n\nOnly results with a metric higher than are considered in the data analysis.\n\n### 3.3. Enclosure and Kinematics\n\nA 3D printer, Witbox 1 (BQ, Madrid, Spain), was adapted to mount the printhead and move it along the desired printing trajectory. The platform that accommodates the nozzle moves along the XY plane, while the Z direction sets its distance to the printing bed. The desired trajectory is defined in GCode and sent to the main printer board via a serial port.\n\nOne of the main advantages of this choice is the flexibility of adapting the printer\u2019s firmware and hardware to the implemented system requirements, namely:\n\nEquipment related to plastic deposition is removed, and its configurations are disabled from the printer\u2019s firmware.\n\nA 3D-printed part is designed to accommodate the printing and monitoring tools, as can be seen in Figure 4b.\n\nStepper S drivers (Stepper, Aalborg, Nordjylland, Denmark) are installed in the X and Y stepper motors to achieve smoother displacement and a precision of 1\/() mm\/step. They are also used for automatic position correction.\n\nA Z probe, BLTouch V3.1 (ANTCLABS, Songpa-gu, Seoul, South Korea), is used to correct possible cleavage between the printing bed and the XY plane where the printhead moves.\n\n\n## 4.

(November 2010) |\n\n| EA Sports MMA | |\n|---|---|\n| Developer | EA Tiburon |\n| Publisher | EA Sports |\n| Platforms | |\n| Release | |\n| Genre | Sports |\n| Modes | Single-player, multiplayer |\n\n* EA Sports MMA* is a 2010 sports video game which was developed by EA Tiburon and published by EA Sports. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360\n\n[3]on October 19, 2010, in North America and October 22, 2010, everywhere else. Online services have been shut down since April 13, 2012\n\n[4]for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n[5]\n\n## Game details\n\n[edit]On June 1, 2009, Electronic Arts announced that an all-new fighting title is in development under the EA Sports brand. *EA Sports MMA* was released in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Its website did not reveal any facts about the gameplay or its release date, just one link to sign up for the EA Sports newsletter and another that directs people to EA Sports' MMA forum.[6] However, the Facebook page for the game released steady numbers of videos and amounts of preview information leading up to the release. This game has many options to create the ultimate MMA experience. The game focuses on global MMA, not restricting its gameplay to one brand or region.\n\nIt was announced that the first trailer would be shown on CBS, during *Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Rogers* on November 7, 2009. The trailer featured Emelianenko and Rogers performing a variety of attacks and defenses against each other. The trailer ended with both of the men about to punch each other in the face. It was announced that EA MMA would feature Strikeforce as its flagship promotion.[7]\n\nThe US cover for the game shows Fedor Emelianenko and Randy Couture, while the Japanese cover has Hidehiko Yoshida instead of Couture.[8]\n\n## Gameplay\n\n[edit]Players can move and strike at enemies. They can turn attacks into body punches, kicks or feints. Takedown\/transition attempts and takedown\/transition defense can be performed. Depending on the timing, the successful defense can result in a sprawl, transitional block or a reversal. Submissions can be attempted, and the defending player can prevent the hold from being applied if he reacts quickly enough. Otherwise, the fighters engage in one of two submission mini-games. Once a submission has been initiated, it is not possible to cancel out of it.\n\nFor arm and leg submissions, the players must tap either the submit or defend button several times until the defending fighter either submits or escapes. The idea is to tap the button in short bursts while maintaining the stamina at optimum levels and never letting it drain completely. For chokes, a circular image appears in the center of the screen. A colored marker moves along the circumference from clockwise to counterclockwise in unpredictable patterns and fades in and out of view. The player (whether on offense or defense) must track and match the movement of the marker with the left analog stick. The circle shrinks (while the screen fades to black) as the fighter gets closer to getting choked out and expands when one gets closer to escaping.\n\nThe game is set in venues to include boxing rings, circular cages, and hexagonal cages, and it includes multiple rule sets including Strikeforce, Japanese, and Vale Tudo rules in addition to standard Unified Rules. The game includes the ability to fight southpaw- or orthodox, execute foot stomps, soccer kicks and knees to the face on the ground, and fight on the cage, with clinch work and countering. Mauro Ranallo and Frank Shamrock provide commentary, but are unable to announce most custom names.[9] Jimmy Lennon Jr. is the announcer in Strikeforce rules and Lenne Hardt is the announcer Japanese and Vale Tudo rules. The game also featured 'Live Broadcasts' that could be viewed from PC or consoles. The player is able to upload hype videos, which will help to increase popularity. EA Sports would choose the fighters based on their Hype videos and schedule fight cards just like in real life MMA. Real-life prizes were given out, to a certain level.[10]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n[edit]The soundtrack features around 30 hip-hop, rock and metal songs from various artists through the EA Trax feature.\n\n## UFC controversy\n\n[edit]UFC president Dana White declared himself \"at war\" with EA over the development of the *EA Sports MMA* video game. According to White, the UFC had hoped that EA Sports would pick up the publishing rights to the UFC's video game license, but EA Sports declined. White remarks, \"EA Sports told us, 'You're not a real sport. We wouldn't touch this thing. We want nothing to do with this.'\" The UFC instead partnered with THQ to develop *UFC 2009 Undisputed*. \"We put our asses on the line, THQ, and the UFC, to make a video-game deal in the worst economy in the world,\" White told reporters in July 2009. \"We go out there and do this thing, and it's successful, and now EA Sports wants to do a video game.[11]\n\nWhite warned the fighters who intend to be included in the upcoming *EA Sports MMA* game release, claiming that \"If you do business with EA, you won't be in the UFC\". Former UFC heavyweight champions Tim Sylvia[12] and Andrei Arlovski, as well as Frank Trigg[13] and Vladimir Matyushenko[14] confirmed their presence in the *EA Sports MMA* video game. Fan favorite Randy Couture was under contract with UFC before agreeing to be a part of *EA Sports MMA*, but was able to take part in the game due to never signing over his likeness to the UFC for use in video games. White has since changed his standpoint on this subject.[15]\n\n## Game launch and reception\n\n[edit]| Aggregator | Score |\n|---|---|\n| GameRankings | 80.5% Xbox 360, 78.2% PS3 |\n| Metacritic | 79% Xbox 360, 78% PS3 |\n\n| Publication | Score |\n|---|---|\nEdge | 6\/10 |\nEurogamer | 7\/10 |\nGame Informer | 8.5\/10 |\nGamePro | |\nGameSpot | 7.5\/10 |\nIGN | 8\/10 |\nOfficial Xbox Magazine (US) | 9\/10 |\nX-Play |\n\n*EA Sports MMA* launched on October 19, 2010, with a public launch party for fans and media. At the gatherings, UFC Hall of Fame fighter Randy Couture and former Pride champion Fedor Emelianenko, both of whom grace the cover of the game, finally got the opportunity to fight each other, albeit via their video gamer personas. Fedor went on to win via TKO in the game.[16]\n\nInitial reviews have been positive with Metacritic giving the Xbox 360 version a score of 79% after 55 reviews (78% after 42 reviews for the PS3 version)[17][18] and Game Rankings giving the Xbox360 version a score of 80.5% after 39 reviews (78.2% after 25 reviews for the PS3 Version).[19][20] While *EA Sports MMA* remains a critical success thus far, it hasn't had the same success financially. According to a Cowen & Company analyst, sales of *EA Sports MMA* have been poor, with analyst Doug Creutz saying it's \u201cmore or less dead on arrival at retail\".[21]\n\nDuring the 14th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated *EA Sports MMA* for \"Fighting Game of the Year\".[22]\n\n## iOS\n\n[edit]On October 21, 2010 *EA Sports MMA* was released as for the iOS platform.[23] It is a scaled-down version of the game, featuring 24 fighters from five different weight class, create-a-fighter mode and career mode.[24]\n\n## Sequel\n\n[edit]On June 4, 2012, Dana White, along with THQ, announced that the UFC game license had been transferred to EA Sports, who produced the next cross-platform UFC game. On June 17, 2014, *EA Sports UFC* was released as a spiritual successor to both *EA Sports MMA* and *UFC Undisputed 3*.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**James Orry (9 June 2009). \"EA to alternate between Fight Night and MMA\".*VideoGamer.Com*.

(November 2010) |\n\n| EA Sports MMA | |\n|---|---|\n| Developer | EA Tiburon |\n| Publisher | EA Sports |\n| Platforms | |\n| Release | |\n| Genre | Sports |\n| Modes | Single-player, multiplayer |\n\n* EA Sports MMA* is a 2010 sports video game which was developed by EA Tiburon and published by EA Sports. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360\n\n[3]on October 19, 2010, in North America and October 22, 2010, everywhere else. Online services have been shut down since April 13, 2012\n\n[4]for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n[5]\n\n## Game details\n\n[edit]On June 1, 2009, Electronic Arts announced that an all-new fighting title is in development under the EA Sports brand. *EA Sports MMA* was released in 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Its website did not reveal any facts about the gameplay or its release date, just one link to sign up for the EA Sports newsletter and another that directs people to EA Sports' MMA forum.[6] However, the Facebook page for the game released steady numbers of videos and amounts of preview information leading up to the release. This game has many options to create the ultimate MMA experience. The game focuses on global MMA, not restricting its gameplay to one brand or region.\n\nIt was announced that the first trailer would be shown on CBS, during *Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Rogers* on November 7, 2009. The trailer featured Emelianenko and Rogers performing a variety of attacks and defenses against each other. The trailer ended with both of the men about to punch each other in the face. It was announced that EA MMA would feature Strikeforce as its flagship promotion.[7]\n\nThe US cover for the game shows Fedor Emelianenko and Randy Couture, while the Japanese cover has Hidehiko Yoshida instead of Couture.[8]\n\n## Gameplay\n\n[edit]Players can move and strike at enemies. They can turn attacks into body punches, kicks or feints. Takedown\/transition attempts and takedown\/transition defense can be performed. Depending on the timing, the successful defense can result in a sprawl, transitional block or a reversal. Submissions can be attempted, and the defending player can prevent the hold from being applied if he reacts quickly enough. Otherwise, the fighters engage in one of two submission mini-games. Once a submission has been initiated, it is not possible to cancel out of it.\n\nFor arm and leg submissions, the players must tap either the submit or defend button several times until the defending fighter either submits or escapes. The idea is to tap the button in short bursts while maintaining the stamina at optimum levels and never letting it drain completely. For chokes, a circular image appears in the center of the screen. A colored marker moves along the circumference from clockwise to counterclockwise in unpredictable patterns and fades in and out of view. The player (whether on offense or defense) must track and match the movement of the marker with the left analog stick. The circle shrinks (while the screen fades to black) as the fighter gets closer to getting choked out and expands when one gets closer to escaping.\n\nThe game is set in venues to include boxing rings, circular cages, and hexagonal cages, and it includes multiple rule sets including Strikeforce, Japanese, and Vale Tudo rules in addition to standard Unified Rules. The game includes the ability to fight southpaw- or orthodox, execute foot stomps, soccer kicks and knees to the face on the ground, and fight on the cage, with clinch work and countering. Mauro Ranallo and Frank Shamrock provide commentary, but are unable to announce most custom names.[9] Jimmy Lennon Jr. is the announcer in Strikeforce rules and Lenne Hardt is the announcer Japanese and Vale Tudo rules. The game also featured 'Live Broadcasts' that could be viewed from PC or consoles. The player is able to upload hype videos, which will help to increase popularity. EA Sports would choose the fighters based on their Hype videos and schedule fight cards just like in real life MMA. Real-life prizes were given out, to a certain level.[10]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n[edit]The soundtrack features around 30 hip-hop, rock and metal songs from various artists through the EA Trax feature.\n\n## UFC controversy\n\n[edit]UFC president Dana White declared himself \"at war\" with EA over the development of the *EA Sports MMA* video game. According to White, the UFC had hoped that EA Sports would pick up the publishing rights to the UFC's video game license, but EA Sports declined. White remarks, \"EA Sports told us, 'You're not a real sport. We wouldn't touch this thing. We want nothing to do with this.'\" The UFC instead partnered with THQ to develop *UFC 2009 Undisputed*. \"We put our asses on the line, THQ, and the UFC, to make a video-game deal in the worst economy in the world,\" White told reporters in July 2009. \"We go out there and do this thing, and it's successful, and now EA Sports wants to do a video game.[11]\n\nWhite warned the fighters who intend to be included in the upcoming *EA Sports MMA* game release, claiming that \"If you do business with EA, you won't be in the UFC\". Former UFC heavyweight champions Tim Sylvia[12] and Andrei Arlovski, as well as Frank Trigg[13] and Vladimir Matyushenko[14] confirmed their presence in the *EA Sports MMA* video game. Fan favorite Randy Couture was under contract with UFC before agreeing to be a part of *EA Sports MMA*, but was able to take part in the game due to never signing over his likeness to the UFC for use in video games. White has since changed his standpoint on this subject.[15]\n\n## Game launch and reception\n\n[edit]| Aggregator | Score |\n|---|---|\n| GameRankings | 80.5% Xbox 360, 78.2% PS3 |\n| Metacritic | 79% Xbox 360, 78% PS3 |\n\n| Publication | Score |\n|---|---|\nEdge | 6\/10 |\nEurogamer | 7\/10 |\nGame Informer | 8.5\/10 |\nGamePro | |\nGameSpot | 7.5\/10 |\nIGN | 8\/10 |\nOfficial Xbox Magazine (US) | 9\/10 |\nX-Play |\n\n*EA Sports MMA* launched on October 19, 2010, with a public launch party for fans and media. At the gatherings, UFC Hall of Fame fighter Randy Couture and former Pride champion Fedor Emelianenko, both of whom grace the cover of the game, finally got the opportunity to fight each other, albeit via their video gamer personas. Fedor went on to win via TKO in the game.[16]\n\nInitial reviews have been positive with Metacritic giving the Xbox 360 version a score of 79% after 55 reviews (78% after 42 reviews for the PS3 version)[17][18] and Game Rankings giving the Xbox360 version a score of 80.5% after 39 reviews (78.2% after 25 reviews for the PS3 Version).[19][20] While *EA Sports MMA* remains a critical success thus far, it hasn't had the same success financially. According to a Cowen & Company analyst, sales of *EA Sports MMA* have been poor, with analyst Doug Creutz saying it's \u201cmore or less dead on arrival at retail\".[21]\n\nDuring the 14th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated *EA Sports MMA* for \"Fighting Game of the Year\".[22]\n\n## iOS\n\n[edit]On October 21, 2010 *EA Sports MMA* was released as for the iOS platform.[23] It is a scaled-down version of the game, featuring 24 fighters from five different weight class, create-a-fighter mode and career mode.[24]\n\n## Sequel\n\n[edit]On June 4, 2012, Dana White, along with THQ, announced that the UFC game license had been transferred to EA Sports, who produced the next cross-platform UFC game. On June 17, 2014, *EA Sports UFC* was released as a spiritual successor to both *EA Sports MMA* and *UFC Undisputed 3*.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**James Orry (9 June 2009). \"EA to alternate between Fight Night and MMA\".*VideoGamer.Com*.

Heavyweight isn\u2019t exactly the best stacked division in MMA but the absence of UFC talent means that there is very few relevant fighters there and more than a few who are nothing more than oddity attractions these days. Tim Sylvia? Ken Shamrock? Kevin Randleman? Bob Sapp? Then to really pad it out they\u2019ve thrown in a few light heavyweights. If EA cannot secure better talent then I can only see this game struggling, especially given that it doesn\u2019t play all that well either.\n\nSeventy2This will really struggle against the UFC branded franchise, especially with, as LycanGav says, a weak roster like this. Most of these guys have seen their better days and Randy Couture is once again aligned with the UFC, so other than Fedor, I can\u2019t see why you\u2019d want to actually play this.\n\nAnd Tim Sylvia? Wow, barrel officially scraped.\n\nThis had better be the NBA Jam of MMA games to even come close to the recent high quality UFC output.\n\nFlightxrandy couture is a big name for ea to have, but as said before without any ufc talent its very weak\n\nMrBillyRandy Couture is signed under the UFC\n\nAs far as i\u2019m aware he\u2019s the only one in that list from UFC though\n\nfattonyxxlBobby Lashley\u2019s WWF\u2026or\u2026WWE\u2026or\u2026WCW\u2026or\u2026TNA?

I. An analysis of melt stress history in an extensional flow geometry\n\n#### Abstract\n\nA numerical and experimental analysis of the melt flow history of poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVF2, in an extensional flow, film\u2011processing geometry is presented. Numerical computations were carried out for both Newtonian and power law flow in an impinging channels die using a finite\u2011element technique. Computations demonstrate that a strong extensional flow exists in the region from the stream impingement point to a distance about 0.75 D downstream where D is the channel height at the impingement point. Measurements of the stress fields using the technique of flow birefringence showed that in consequence of the changing flow kinematics from the stream impingement region to the downstream converging channels region, both the isochromatic and isoclinic patterns exhibit a pronounced axial positional dependence. Excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement was found between measured and calculated shear stress fields. However, large differences were exhibited between calculated and measured normal stress differences along the symmetry axis of flow. Results to be presented in a companion paper (Part II) demonstrate that the strong extensional flow which occurs in this geometry is sufficient to produce oriented, row\u2011nucleated structures in the extruded PVF2 films.\n\n- Publication:\n-\nJournal of Applied Polymer Science\n- Pub Date:\n- August 1988\n- DOI:\n- Bibcode:\n- 1988JAPS...36..859K","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step 1 \u2014 Search: I queried the literature for keywords matching the described work (extensional flow, melt stress history, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, PVDF, Khomami\/McHugh). functions.search returned hits pointing to a 1988 J.

The challenge is to be able to link materials behavior and seek patterns among multiple length and time scales. Materials informatics and statistical learning techniques permit one to survey complex, multiscale information in an accelerated and statistically robust and yet meaningful manner. When this is coupled with advanced tools for computational thermodynamics and kinetic simulations, the result is a powerful computational infrastructure for materials design.

The feasible region (the region where probabilities do not decay exponentially with time) grows linearly with time, as is the case with one-dimensional QRW. The limiting shape of the feasible region is, however, quite different. The limit region turns out to be an algebraic set, which we characterize as the rational image of a compact algebraic variety. We also compute the probability profile within the limit region, which is essentially a negative power of the Gaussian curvature of the same algebraic variety. Our methods are based on analysis of the space-time generating function, following the methods of Pemantle and Wilson (J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A 97(1):129\u2013161, 2002).\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## References\n\nAharonov, Y., Davidovich, L., Zagury, N.: Quantum random walks. Phys. Rev.

The Hamiltonian is space- and time-invariant. The allowed\ntransitions at each time are a \ufb01nite set of integer translations. In addition to location, the particle\npossesses an internal state (the chirality), which is necessary to make the evolution of the location\nnondeterministic. A rigorous mathematical analysis of this system in one dimension was \ufb01rst given\nby [ABN+01]. The particle moves ballistically, meaning that at time n, its distance from the origin\nis likely to be of order n. By contrast, the classical random walk moves di\ufb00usively, being localized\nto an interval of size \u221an at time n.\n\n{\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u2282\n\n(0, 1), (0,\n\n1, 0)\n}\n\n1), (1, 0), (\n\nZd with cardinality k and a k\n\nA very similar process may be de\ufb01ned in higher dimensions.\n\nIn particular, given a subset\nE\nk unitary matrix U , there is a corresponding space- and\ntime-homogeneous QRW in which allowed transitions are translations by elements of E and evolution of chirality is governed by U . When E is the set of signed standard basis vectors we\ncall this a nearest neighbor QRW; for example in two dimensions, a nearest neighbor walk has\nE =\n; a complete construction of quantum random walk is given in\nSection 2.1 below. Published work on quantum random walk in dimensions two and higher began\naround 2002 (see [MBSS02]). Most studies, including the most recent and broad study [WKKK08],\nare concerned to a great extent with localization; this phenomenon is not generic in quantum random walk models and not present in the models we discuss below. The analyses we have seen\nrange from analytic derivations without complete proofs to numerical studies. As far as we know,\nno rigorous analysis of two-dimensional QRW has been published. The question of describing the\nbehavior of two-dimensional QRW was brought to our attention by Cris Moore (personal communication). In the present paper, we answer this question by proving theorems about the limiting\nshape of the feasible region (the region where probabilities do not decay exponentially with time) for\ntwo-dimensional QRW, and by giving asymptotically valid formulae for the probability amplitudes\nat speci\ufb01c locations within this region.\n\nCommon to every nondegenerate instance of two-dimensional QRW is ballistic motion with random velocity in some feasible set of velocities, with exponentially decaying probabilities to be found\noutside the feasible set. The feasible set varies by instance and its shape appears strange and unpredictable. We will show that it is the image of a compact set (a torus) under the logarithmic Gauss\nmap. An explicit description of the feasible set and explicit formulae for probability amplitudes at\nspeci\ufb01c points inside and outside of the feasible set may be obtained; however, these details di\ufb00er\ngreatly from one instance to another. Because of this, it is di\ufb03cult to state an omnibus theorem\nas to asymptotic large-time amplitudes. Instead, we concentrate on three familes of nearest neighbor QRW which together capture all of the qualititative behavior we have seen. These examples\n\n1\n\n\n\n---\n\nalso embody all the techniques one would need to analyze other instances. The choice of these\nparticular three families is somewhat of a historical accident, these being one-parameter families of\nunitary matrices interpolating between various standard unitary matrices (such as Hadamard matrices) which are commonly used and which we \ufb01rst used in numerical experiments. The reason we\nused one-parameter families was to make animations of the resulting feasible regions as the value of\nthe parameter changed.\n\n1.2 Methods\n\nOur analyses begin with the space-time generating function. This is a multivariate rational function\nwhich may be derived without too much di\ufb03culty. The companion paper [BP07] introduces this\napproach and applies it to an arbitrary one-dimensional QRW with two chiralities (k = 2). This\napproach allows one to obtain detailed asymptotics such as an Airy-type limit in a scaling window\nnear the endpoints. As such, it improves on the analysis of [ABN+01] but not on the more recent\nand very nice analysis of [CIR03]. In one dimension, when the number of chiralities exceeds two,\nN. Konno [IKS05] found new behavior that is qualitatively di\ufb00erent from the two-chirality QRW.\nForthcoming work of the last author with T. Greenwood uses the generating function approach to\ngreatly extend Konno\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\n\nThe generating function approach, however, pays its greatest dividends in dimension two and\nhigher. This approach is based on recent results on asymptotics of multivariate rational generating functions. These results allow nearly automatic transfer from rational generating functions to\nasymptotic formulae for their coe\ufb03cients [PW02; PW04; PW08; BP08]. Based on these transfer theorems, analysis of any instance of a two-dimensional QRW becomes relatively easy, with the main\ntechnical work being in adaptation of existing methods to more general setting, or in exploiting\nsimpli\ufb01cations arising in cases of interest.\n\nThere is, however, a price to pay in terms of overhead: algebraic geometry of the pole variety\nplays a central role, and one must understand as well the amoeba (domains of convergence of\nLaurent series), the logarithmic Gauss map, and residue methods in several complex variables. All\nof this is laid out in [PW02] and [PW04], but these are long and technical. In the present work,\nwe aim to satisfy two audiences: those interested in QRW from the physics or quantum information\ntheory end, who may care much more about results than methods, and those chie\ufb02y interested in\ncombinatorial analysis, who are familiar with more standard generating function methods but know\nlittle about quantum walks or multivariate generating function analysis. With this in mind, we\nattempt an explanation of mutlivariate rational generating function analysis that is limited to the\ncases at hand: functions satisfying the toriality condition of Proposition 2.1. A table of notation\nappearing at the end of the introduction should enable the reader to skim any parts of the paper\nfocusing on details of less concern.\n\n2\n\n\n\n---\n\nIn the end, we believe that the technical baggage in this paper is worth the price because the\nresults tell a de\ufb01nitive story about QRW in any dimension. No family of QRW in dimension three\nor higher has been analyzed to date, for example, but such an undertaking should be a modest\nextension of the present work. Also, the study of bound states in dimensions two and higher should\nreduce to factorability of the determinant in equation (2.4) below.\n\n1.3 Results\n\nFigure 1a shows the probabilities at time 200 for a particular QRW (one discussed in Section 4.3).\nOur main goal is to predict and explain such phenomena by computing asymptotic limits.

The pictures, which appear scattered throughout the paper, are quite varied. Not\nonly did we \ufb01nd these pictures visually intriguing, but they pointed us toward some re\ufb01nements of\nthe theoretical work in [PW02], which we now describe, beginning with a more detailed description\nof the two plots.\n\nOn the right is depicted the probability distribution for the location of a particle after 200 steps\nof a quantum random walk on the planar integer lattice; the particular instance of QRW is a nearest\nneighbor walk (E =\n) whose unitary matrix is discussed in Section 4.\n1, 0)\n}\nGreater probabilities are shown as darker shades of grey.

The plot in Figure 1a\nis a picture of this characterization, constructed by parametrizing \u039e by patches in the \ufb02at torus\nT0 := (R\/2\u03c0Z)2 and then depicting the patches by showing the image of a grid embedded in the\ntorus.\n\nWhen the plot was constructed, it was intended only to exhibit the overall shape. Nevertheless,\nit is visually obvious that signi\ufb01cant internal structure is duplicated as well. Identical dark regions\nin the shape of a Maltese cross appear inside each of the two \ufb01gures. To explain this, we consider\nthe map \u03a6 : T\nV\ndenote the pole variety of the generating function F for a given QRW, that is, the complex algebraic\nhypersurface on which the denominator H of F vanishes. Let\nwith\nthe unit torus T. It is easy to solve for the third coordinate z as a local function of x and y on\nand thereby obtain a piecewise parametrization\n\nR2 whose image produces the region \u039e, where T denotes the unit torus.

The Jacobian of the composition is the product of the Jacobians of the factors,\nthe most signi\ufb01cant factor being the Gauss map, n.\nIts Jacobian is just the Gaussian curvature\n(in logarithmic coordinates). The darkest regions therefore correspond to the places where the\ncurvature of log\nV1 vanishes. Alignment of this picture with the empirical amplitudes can only\nmean that the formulae for asymptotics of generating functions given in [PW02] blow up when the\nGaussian curvature of log\nV1 vanishes. This observation allowed us to produce new expressions for\nthe quantities in the conclusions of theorems in [PW02], where lengthy polynomials were replaced\nby quantities involving Gaussian curvatures.\n\n4\n\n\n\n---\n\n1.4 Summary\n\nTo summarize, the purpose of this paper is twofold:\n\n1. In Theorem 4.9, we prove the shape conjecture from [Bra07]; further instances of this are\n\nproved in Theorems 4.2 and 4.7.\n\n2. In Theorems 3.3 and 3.5 we reformulate the main result in [PW02] to clarify the relation\nbetween the asymptotics of a multivariate rational generating function and the curvature of\nthe pole variety in logarithmic coordinates.\n\nThe organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives some background\non quantum random walks, notions of Gaussian curvature, amoebas of Laurent polynomials, the\nmultivariate Cauchy formula, and certain standard applications of the stationary phase method to\nthe evaluation of oscillating integrals. Section 3 contains general results on rational multivariate\nasymptotics that will be used in the derivation of the QRW limit theorems. In particular, Theorem 3.3 gives a new formulation of the main result of [PW02], while Theorem 3.5 proves a version\nV1 is more complicated than can be handled\nof these results in situations where the geometry of\nby the methods of [PW02]. Finally, Section 4 applies these results to a collection of instances of\ntwo-dimensional nearest neighbor QRW in which the unitary matrices are elements of one-parameter\nfamilies named S(t), A(t) and B(t), 0 < t < 1. This results in Theorems 4.2, 4.7 and 4.9 respectively.\nIllustrations of feasible sets for these families of QRW may be found in Section 4.\n\n5\n\n\n\n---\n\n1.5 Table of notation\n\nNotation\n\nMeaning\n\nLocation\n\n\u039e\nTd, T\nn\nk, E, U, v(1), . . . , v(k)\nM\nF (z)\nG\/H\n\nV\nV1\nK\nLog\n\n\u2207log\nW(r)\n\nH\nRES (F dz)\nthe superscript\nB0\nK\n\n\u25e6\n\nW\nG\n\nfeasible set of velocities\nunit torus in Cd\nlogarithmic Gauss map\nparameters of a generic QRW\ndiagonal matrix of one-step monomials\nspacetime generating function\nrational function representation of F\nthe pole variety, where H vanishes\nT\nthe Gauss-Kronecker curvature\nlog modulus map\nlogarithmic gradient\nset of critical points for direction r\nHessian determinant\nresidue form\nhomogeneous part\nlog-domain for the Laurent series F\ndual cone to B0 at 0\n\nV \u2229\n\nthe singular subset of\nthe image n[\n\nV1\n]\nV1 \\ W\n\nSection 1\nSection 1\nEquation (1.1)\nSection 2.1\nEquation (2.2)\nEquation (2.3)\nEquation (2.4)\nProposition 2.2\nProposition 2.2, Section 3\nEquation (2.6)\nEquation (2.12)\nfollowing Equation (2.14)\nEquation (2.14)\nEquation (2.16)\nProposition 3.1\nEquation (3.7)\nSection 2.3\npreceding Theorem 3.3\nSection 3\nSection 4\n\n6\n\n\n\n---\n\n2 Preliminaries\n\n2.1 Quantum random walks\n\n\u2265\n\n1 be the spatial dimension.

Here, the sacred complex of Chashma (spring), also known as Nur-Bulak, is located. This complex is one of the oldest and most revered sacred sites in Central Asia.\n\nAs early as the 10th century, the Islamic chronicler Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ja\u2019far al-Narshakhi (899-959) described Nurata in his work \u201cHistory of Bukhara\u201d as a place of mass religious worship. \u201cHyp \u2014 a large settlement; there is a congregational mosque and many rabats (fortified structures). Every year, the residents of Bukhara and other places travel there to venerate the holy sites and consider this journey to be quite soul-saving for themselves. It is even said that visiting Nur for worship is as godly and redemptive as performing the Hajj. Upon the return of the pilgrim from the village of Nur, the city adorns itself with wreaths \u2014 in celebration of their return from such a blessed place. This village of Nur is referred to in other regions as \u2018the light of Bukhara\u2019 because many tabi\u2019in (people who, in their lifetime, met the companions of the Prophet Muhammad) are buried there \u2014 may God be pleased with them all until the Day of Judgment.\u201d\n\nAccording to local legends, in ancient times, a meteorite fell from the sky, piercing the rocky layers and creating a deep well. From this well, the waters of a healing spring began to flow into the waterless steppe, nourishing an entire oasis. It is believed that a heavenly light sometimes appears above the spring even to this day. \u201cWhen the Prophet Muhammad ascended to the heavens on the night of Mi\u2019raj, he saw a shining beam below. The angels said that the Almighty created this land for His beloveds, endowed with His light and mercy,\u201d proudly recount the modern residents of Nurata. In their opinion, the very name of the city comes from the Persian words \u201cnur\u201d (light) and \u201cato\u201d (gifted). Many assert that the last mystical glow above the well appeared on May 17, 2004, and lasted for an entire month. \u201cWhoever truly believes, whoever has God in their heart, can see the heavenly beam at any moment, right now,\u201d the pilgrims are convinced.\n\nThe well itself, known as Beshpanja (which means five fingers, palm, and in a higher sense \u2014 the hand of God), has been well preserved to this day. Its walls are reinforced with unhewn stone blocks. The bottom of the well resembles the back of a hand in its outlines and, according to local theologians, bears a striking resemblance to the calligraphic inscription of the word \u201cAllah.\u201d\n\nThe flow of water from the spring is between 360-450 liters per second, and its temperature remains constant throughout the year at 19.1 degrees Celsius. The chemical composition of the water was well studied in the last century, characterized by a high content of chloride and silver ions, as well as sulfates and carbonates. Additionally, the water here contains ions of potassium, sodium, magnesium, nickel, copper, chromium, zinc, iron, manganese, and fluorine \u2014 a total of over 20 minerals. Remarkably, the water does not taste salty. In Nurata, pilgrims drink it directly from the irrigation canals, despite the large number of fish \u2014 marinka \u2014 that inhabit them. It is believed that due to the high content of chlorine and silver, this water can be consumed even without boiling. Furthermore, it is attributed with healing properties. In recent times, the water from the Beshpanja spring has been used to treat all ailments, including mental disorders and bites from rabid animals.\n\nFish are found in the spring itself, in the large pool adjacent to it, and in the city canals. However, no one feeds or catches them for food. As is known, the marinka, which is widespread in many mountain streams and bodies of water in Uzbekistan, has toxic roe, milt, and abdominal organs. It can only be consumed if the innards are carefully removed. However, eating it from the revered springs is taboo. \u201cWe know ourselves that the royal fish, shah-balyk, can be prepared properly. But our ancestors said that if one eats fish from the sacred spring, their body will be covered with white spots of leprosy, or death will come immediately. They invented this to protect the fish even in the hungriest years, for without them, the purity of the water would be disrupted,\u201d the residents of Nurata explain. Around this well, as in ancient times, women pilgrims perform circular walks, hoping for the fulfillment of their wishes. \u201cWe explain to the pilgrims that they should direct their requests to the Almighty, not to the well or the fish in it,\u201d the guardians of the sacred site clarify.\n\nFrom the Beshpanja well, four large irrigation canals flow. There is not a single courtyard in Nurata through which at least one of these canals does not pass. Thus, one could say that Nurata remains a city irrigated by water from a single source. However, there is also a water supply system here, which is filled not from surface runoff but from underground reservoirs in the foothills of the Nurata Mountains.\n\nAccording to archaeological data, the age of the cultural layer in this oasis may exceed 4,000 years. There are many kyarizes\u2014underground water conduits\u2014here. The climate on the eastern edge of the Kyzylkum Desert remains extremely arid, just as it has for thousands of years. Water from seasonal rains trickles down from the mountain peaks into deep layers of soil and becomes accessible to humans only through springs. Therefore, it is no surprise that people here worship these sources.\n\nEthnographer Alexander Shevyakov, who thoroughly researched the Nurata oasis in the late 1990s, believes that the cult of the Beshpanja well may have originated in antiquity. It was later transformed and \u201cadopted\u201d by Muslim missionaries. Next to the sacred spring lies a mazar\u2014the tomb of the local saint Nur Ota. Some legends identify him with the legendary Sufi mentor and companion of Junayd al-Baghdadi, Hazrat Abdul Hasan al-Nuri, about whom the famous 13th-century Persian Sufi poet Farid al-Din Attar wrote in his hagiographical work \u201cTazkirat al-Awliya\u201d (\u201cBiographies of the Saints\u201d): \u201cThe face of Nuri was so radiant that when he sat in a dark room and prayed, the room would fill with light.\u201d However, from a historical perspective, the identification of Nur Ota with Hazrat al-Nuri is unlikely. According to the archaeologist and academician Yahya Gulamov (1908-1977), hearing about the miracles of the Beshpanja spring, an Islamic preacher named Sheikh Ahmad ibn Muhammad Abdul Hasan came to Nur from Bukhara in the 9th century, distinguished by his extremely zealous attitude toward faith. He lived in the oasis until the end of his days, earned the nickname Nur Ota from the people, and was buried here at the age of 69. Next to his grave lies the tomb of his beautiful righteous daughter Nurgul bibi, which made Nurata particularly popular among women pilgrims.\n\nIn general, the Chashma sacred complex, in addition to the Beshpanja well, includes two mosques. The first is the Panjvakta Mosque, built in the 16th century, where daily five-time prayers are held. The second is the Friday mosque Chilustun, with forty columns; it is a reconstruction of a 9th-century mosque. Above the spring, on the hills, rise impressive clay ruins of fortifications \u2014 in the past, tour guides liked to call them \u201cthe fortress built by Alexander the Great during his campaign from Sogdiana to the land of the Scythians.\u201d Today, when evaluating the antiquity of these structures, a historical approach prevails: it is believed that in the late Middle Ages, these fortifications could have played a very important role in defending not only the Nurata oasis but also the northern borders of the Bukhara Khanate and the oases of Samarkand, which were subjected to raids by steppe nomads.\n\nIn Nurata, near the Seyitkul Auliye cemetery, there is the mausoleum of Aiteke-bi Baibekuly from the Alchin clan (1644-1700), built in 2012. He was a famous legal scholar of the Kazakh people, a disciple of Emir Zhalantos, and at the age of 30 was recognized as a biy of the Junior Juz (the Juz are tribal unions of Kazakhs, referred to as the Elder, Middle, and Junior Juz; biy is a leader or head of a tribe). Although, according to other sources, Aiteke-bi is buried 75 kilometers from Tashkent, near the city of Chinaz, the opening of his mausoleum in Nurata became a significant milestone in the political rapprochement between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and attracted a multitude of Kazakh pilgrims to Nurata.\n\nCurrently, around the Chashma sacred complex in Nurata, modern hotels are being completed, which should make this unique place accessible to European tourists. Among all the cities of modern Uzbekistan, Nurata, located in a remote but picturesque desert area, remains perhaps the most exotic corner, adorned with ancient legends and imbued with a unique color.\n\n@ Andrey Kudryashov \/ \u201cFergana\u201d\n\nExplore Zoroastrian artifacts in Tashkent\n\nVisit ancient Buddhist sites in Termez\n\nTour Greco-Bactrian fortress Kampyr-Tepe\n\nVisit ancient Khorezmian fortresses\n\nDiscover Afrasiab\u2019s ancient city ruins\n\n# Open Result 1\n# Chashma, Mianwali\n\nAppearance\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.

He was a naval innovator and an early advocate for a propeller-driven, steam-powered navy. Stockton was from a notable political family and also served as a U.S. senator from New Jersey.\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]Robert F. Stockton was born at Morven, Stockton Street, Princeton, New Jersey, into a political family; his father Richard Stockton was a U.S. senator and representative, and his grandfather, Judge Richard Stockton, was attorney general for New Jersey and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Robert F. Stockton was of English descent, and his family had been in what is now the United States since the early colonial period. On March 4, 1823, he married Harriet Maria Potter in Charleston, South Carolina. Ten children were born to this marriage.[1]\n\n### Early naval service\n\n[edit]Stockton was appointed a midshipman in the U.S. Navy in September 1811, shortly after his 16th birthday, and served at sea and ashore during the War of 1812. After that conflict, Lieutenant Stockton was assigned to ships operating in the Mediterranean, in the Caribbean and off the coast of West Africa. He was the first naval officer to act against the slave trade and captured several slave ships. In December 1821, while commanding USS *Alligator* along the African Windward Coast, Lt. Stockton, along with Dr. Eli Ayers of the American Colonization Society,[2] negotiated a treaty that led to the founding of the state of Liberia. One source said that Stockton \"leveled a pistol at King Peter's head and thereby convinced the latter to sell some of his territory\".[3] Another source states that, before Stockton leveled his pistol at King Peter, he handed another pistol to Ayers, directing him to shoot a mixed race slave trader who was warning King Peter that the Americans sought to end the slave trade from which King Peter's tribe profited.[4]\n\n### Business affairs\n\n[edit]During the later 1820s and into the 1830s, Stockton primarily devoted his attention to business affairs in New Jersey. In addition, Stockton owned and operated the Tellurium gold mine in Goochland and Fluvanna counties in Virginia. He had purchased it in 1848, after its discovery in 1832.[5] His son John P. Stockton was born during this period. He later followed his father into politics and was elected as a U.S. senator representing New Jersey.\n\nIn 1835, Stockton purchased a property in Monmouth County, New Jersey, called \"Sea Girt\".[6] The property was purchased in 1875 by a group of land developers, with the name of Stockton's estate ultimately leading to the choice of the name Sea Girt, New Jersey, when the borough was established in 1918.[7]\n\n### Resumes active naval service\n\n[edit]In 1838, Stockton resumed active naval service as a captain. He served in the European area but took leave in 1840 to undertake political work. Offered the post of U.S. Secretary of the Navy by President John Tyler in 1841, he declined the offer but worked successfully to gain support for the construction of an advanced steam warship with a battery of very heavy guns.\n\nThis ship became USS *Princeton*, the Navy's first screw-propelled steamer. The ship was designed by John Ericsson. Stockton commanded her when she was completed in 1843. The ship was armed with two long 225-pounder wrought iron guns, called the \"*Peacemaker*\" and the \"*Oregon*\". Although he was the deviser of the defective gun, Captain Stockton's political influence allowed him to be absolved of all responsibility for the February 1844 explosion of the gun, the *Peacemaker*, on board the ship. The explosion killed two cabinet secretaries and several others.[8]\n\nCleared by the court of any wrongdoing in the explosion incident, Stockton was sent by President James K. Polk to Texas. Stockton carried with him Polk's offer to annex Texas, sailing on the *Princeton* and arriving in Galveston. Stockton's observations while in Texas made him aware of the looming war with Mexico, a fact he communicated directly to Polk once he arrived back in Washington.[9] No vessel during the Mexican war was more useful than the *Princeton* in the Gulf of Mexico.[10][11] The records of the Navy Department showed she performed more service than all the rest of the Gulf squadron put together. [ citation needed]\n\n### Mexican\u2013American War\n\n[edit]**Conquest of California**\n\nOn July 23, 1846, Commodore Stockton arrived in Monterey, California, and took over command from the ailing Commodore John D. Sloat of the Pacific Squadron of U.S. naval forces in the Pacific Ocean.[12] Commodore Sloat had previously raised the US flag, without resistance, at Monterey, but had no plan to conduct any further military operations on shore and once relieved, sailed home to the United States, leaving Commodore Stockton in command of all US forces. Stockton's command ship was USS *Congress* and his combined fleet of three frigates with about 480 men each, one ship of the line with about 780 men and up to four sloops with about 200 men each as well as three storeships made him the strongest force in California as well as the senior military commander and military governor. He was the main driving force in continuing to take possession of Alta California.\n\nOn August 11, 1846, Commodore Stockton marched on Pueblo de Los Angeles to meet in battle with General Castro's army. Upon learning of the imminent arrival of Commodore Stockton, Castro retired, leaving behind all his artillery and made off in the direction of Sonora. Immediately after these events Stockton dispatched a courier, Kit Carson, to inform Washington of the proceedings and details of his conquest of California.\n\nOn December 6, 1846, Stockton learned that General Stephen Kearny had arrived in California with a small force and that he was besieged by vastly superior enemy forces at the Battle of San Pasqual. Kearny was among the wounded and in command of only 60 weary dragoons mounted on tired mules who were in a perilous position and under attack from a Californio-Mexican cavalry force under Andr\u00e9s Pico. However, for Commodore Stockton's immediate decision to take personal command of a relief column, the outcome could have been disastrous for Kearny.\n\nLater, the combined forces consolidated control over San Diego, and in January 1847 won the minor skirmishes at the Battle of Rio San Gabriel and Battle of La Mesa taking back control of Los Angeles. Faced with the approximate 200 men under John C. Fremont's California Battalion as well as Stockton and Kearny's troops, the Californios sued for peace and signed the Treaty of Cahuenga, which ending fighting in Alta California. Stockton, as senior military authority and military governor of the occupied territory, authorized John C. Fremont's appointment to succeed him as military governor and commander of the California Battalion militia force. When General Kearny finally arrived with orders to assume control of the temporary government Stockton turned over control to Kearny.\n\n### Political pursuits\n\n[edit]Stockton resigned from the Navy in May 1850 and returned to business and political pursuits. In 1851, he was elected as a Democrat from New Jersey to the United States Senate, where he sponsored a bill to abolish flogging as a Navy punishment. He resigned on January 10, 1853, to serve as president of the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, a position he held until 1866.\n\nHe was a delegate to the unsuccessful Peace Conference of 1861 that attempted to settle the secession crisis; instead the American Civil War began later that year. In 1863, he was appointed to command the New Jersey militia when the Confederate Army invaded Pennsylvania. Stockton died at Princeton, New Jersey, in October 1866, and is buried in the Princeton Cemetery.\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]Four U.S. Navy ships have been named USS *Stockton* in his honor. The cities of Stockton, California and Stockton, Missouri are named in his honor, as is the borough of Stockton, New Jersey, Stockton Street in San Francisco, and Fort Stockton, San Diego, California, which is now a ruin, but was occupied during the Mexican\u2013American War. In Mariposa County, California Stockton Creek is named after him due to a mine he owned in the California Gold Rush. In Liberia, Stockton Creek, a tidal channel that connects the Mesurado River and the Saint Paul River, and that separates Bushrod Island from the mainland in Monrovia, is also named for him.\n\nFormerly Commodore Stockton Elementary School in San Francisco between Clay and Pacific Streets was named after him. Stockton Street in San Jose was named after him and his Garden Alameda San Jose neighborhood. In Sacramento, Stockton Boulevard is the historic thoroughfare linking Sacramento and Stockton, now superseded by Highway 99 and Interstate 5.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^***A Sketch of the Life of Com.

Together with a colleague specializing in neural networks from the same institution, they shifted focus to densely connected systems of continuous-state units. Their investigation explored the intricate 'movements' and potential for unpredictable, non-repeating patterns arising when these units, linked by Hebbian principles, possess activation responses that deviate significantly from the standard smoothed threshold curve. What precise title captures this study of system behaviour driven by unconventional analogue unit responses?\nReason step by step using the given tools and provide the final answer in \\boxed{}.","role":"user"}],"completion":[{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_SDYdNtTqeG8W6n4Ll9Gzcs8L\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"mid-1990s Belgium theoretical physics neural networks Hebbian continuous-state nonmonotonic activation statistical mechanics paper 'Belgium' 'Hebbian' 'continuous units' 'statistical mechanics' 1995 1996 1997\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] Neural Networks and Statistical Learning - ResearchGate\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Ke-Lin-Du\/publication\/264912450_Neural_Networks_and_Statistical_Learning\/links\/54d49ff20cf2970e4e635812\/Neural-Networks-and-Statistical-Learning.pdf\nThe contents cover almost all the major popular neural network models and statistical learning approaches, including the multilayer perceptron,.\n\n---\n\nResult 1: [PDF] STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF NEURAL NETWORKS\nURL: https:\/\/neurophysics.ucsd.edu\/courses\/physics_171\/Sompolinsky_PhysicsToday.pdf\nIn this article I will describe how the concepts and tools of theoretical physics are being applied to the study of neural networks.

The basis of the theory is when our brains learn something new, neurons are activated and connected with other neurons, forming a neural network.\nQ: Is Hebbian learning supervised or unsupervised?\nA: Hebbian learning is unsupervised. LMS learning is supervised. However, a form of LMS can be constructed to perform unsupervised learning and, as such, LMS can be used in a natural way to implement Hebbian learning. Combining the two paradigms creates a new unsupervised learning algorithm, Hebbian-LMS.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_FOxA6DMGwzsZKDJ86NmK33l5\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"nonmonotonic\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Physica A\\\\\\\" 1995 Hebb 'continuous' 'neural' 'Belgium'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Neural Networks and Statistical Learning\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Ke-Lin-Du\/publication\/264912450_Neural_Networks_and_Statistical_Learning\/links\/54d49ff20cf2970e4e635812\/Neural-Networks-and-Statistical-Learning.pdf\n...

It formulates the updating gradient of the connecting weight in artificial neural networks.\nQ: Is Hebbian learning supervised or unsupervised?\nA: Hebbian learning is unsupervised. LMS learning is supervised. However, a form of LMS can be constructed to perform unsupervised learning and, as such, LMS can be used in a natural way to implement Hebbian learning. Combining the two paradigms creates a new unsupervised learning algorithm, Hebbian-LMS.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_pSYgnU69Y6PQtvRobNW76Icd\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Physica A\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Hebbian\\\\\\\" 1995 1996 \\\\\\\"continuous\\\\\\\" 'nonmonotonic' 'Physica A' 1996 neural 'Hebb' 'continuous units' 'Belgium' author 'Brussels' 'Li\\u00e8ge' 'Leuven'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"Physica A\" \"Hebbian\" 1995 1996 \"continuous\" 'nonmonotonic' 'Physica A' 1996 neural 'Hebb' 'continuous units' 'Belgium' author 'Brussels' 'Li\u00e8ge' 'Leuven'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_EP3q41S0AyREmND7Z3ckPSfd\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"analog units\\\\\\\" Hebbian Physica A 1995 \\\\\\\"continuous-state\\\\\\\" 'Hebbian' 'Physica A' 'analogue' 'nonmonotonic' 'chaos'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: \"analog units\" Hebbian Physica A 1995 \"continuous-state\" 'Hebbian' 'Physica A' 'analogue' 'nonmonotonic' 'chaos'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_XDx9bmKJnsWSZ7wYUIKcWdts\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"continuous-state\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Hebbian\\\\\\\" Physica A 'nonmonotonic' 'analogue' 'Belgium' '1995' '1996'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Self-organizing continuous attractor networks and path ...\nURL: https:\/\/web.cs.dal.ca\/~tt\/papers\/ne2204.pdf\nIn this section we describe formally the model of a continuous attractor network that we investigate, and show how the weights could be trained, both by a Hebbian method previously discussed by Zhang (1996) and Redish and Touretzky (1998), and with Hebbian learning with a short term memory trace to help with the issue of irregular training, and ...\n\n---\n\nResult 1: Spike-based reinforcement learning in continuous state and ...\nURL: https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/19997492\/\nThe family of learning rules includes an optimal rule derived from policy gradient methods as well as reward modulated Hebbian learning.

The approach involves assessing time-sequential security issues\u2014such as voltage excursions and line congestion\u2014using probabilistic load flow combined with dynamic sensitivity weighting.

In the rural areas of the US Midwest and in Norway the one-room schoolhouse was the most common school in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth. Although the schoolhouses at first sight seem identical there are some interesting points of distinction in their educational history and how their legacy is interpreted, managed, preserved and promoted today. In the Midwest they are a beloved national icon, often listed, embodying national values and virtues. In Norway their story is effectively untold, not a single one is listed on national preservation lists and by no means do they embody national identity, virtues or values. This article offers an explanation for this different treatment.\n\n## Entr\u00e9es d\u2019index\n\n### Keywords:\n\nCultural heritage, education history, Midwest and Norway., one-room schoolhouse, preservation## Plan\n\nHaut de page## Texte int\u00e9gral\n\n# 1.1 Introduction\n\n1\n\n2The first American one-room schoolhouse I visited was the Little red School house in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The small schoolhouse was originally located in Bennington Township. The new location in Black Hawk Park, the red color, the grand bell-tower as well as the colorful American flag outside the building, made the small schoolhouse visible and significant in the small city. Inside the classroom, in addition to old furniture, maps and blackboards, a huge American flag and pictures of President Washington and Lincoln was the dominant visible element in the classroom. The impression I got after my first experience with an American one-room schoolhouse and how it was displayed was quite different from the conception I had after having seen several one-room schoolhouse in Norway.\n\n3The definition of one-room schoolhouses is a school consisting of one classroom where a single teacher taught academic basics to several grade levels of elementary-age boys and girls. The one-room schoolhouse is to be found in several countries both in Europe and overseas, but is characteristic for rural areas with sparse population, for example Ireland, Shetland, New-Zeeland, Scandinavia, Canada and Australia. Nevertheless, although the one-room schoolhouse has played an important role in both the American Midwest and Norwegian history, the contemporary European approach, represented by Norway, and the American approach and motivation for preservation differs. The contrast between sixty listed schoolhouses in Iowa and none in Norway needs an explanation. The total number of schoolhouses in Iowa in 1901 was 12,623 which were more than twice as many as in Norway, but the difference in total number does not explain the disparity in preservation.1 Neither do the construction, the size, ownership, the architectural qualities, demographical changes, if the schoolhouses are standardized or not, the age of the schoolhouse or the location. All these elements are comparable. Differences in legislation and management of cultural heritage could be a part of the explanation, but will not explain the major differences. The reason for the difference has to been found in the cultural background, in the educational history as well as in the need for historical symbols in contemporary society.\n\n4Better education was both a goal and a tool in the comprehensive modernizing projects of the nineteenth century, and in many rural communities the school became a trigger for the development of democratic and social institutions. The schoolhouses were in most communities the first public building to be erected, and became an arena for social, political and religious meetings. The school boards were often the first democratic institutions established in the local communities, and played a vital role in the development of democratic society in the late nineteenth century. Last but not least the one-room schoolhouse held notable significance as an institution for education, and represented a shift towards better education and schooling.2\n\n5The history of education has been the subject of comprehensive study in the United States, but one-room schoolhouses as cultural heritage, the narratives of the one-room schoolhouse era, and whether and why old schoolhouses are regarded as an object of interest have so far not been widely discussed. Andrew Gulliford's *America`s Country Schools* was part of the comprehensive research project \u2018Country school legacy\u2019. However, the author only briefly questioned the contemporary use of schoolhouses as heritage objects. His main goal is to offer a manual for conservationists.3\n\n6Wayne E. Fuller has drawn attention to the fact that the one-room schoolhouse has \u2018become so deeply embedded in the American consciousness that today, long after most schools have disappeared, it is still a useful symbol\u2019,4 but at the very end of his book he reduces the useful symbol to a legacy for young children whereby they can \u2018appreciate their own comfortable classrooms and be inspired to take advantage of the bounteous opportunities they have to further their education and to be whatever they wish to be\u2019.\n\n7The lack of reflections about preservation of schoolhouses has been a general tendency in most publications on one-room schoolhouses, with the exception of Jonathan Zimmerman, whose recent book, *Small Wonder: The Little Red Schoolhouse in History and Memory*, comments on the use of schoolhouses in current political battles.So far it has not been possible to identify any publications in Norway dealing with this issue, and in the existing publications the reason for preservation is often limited to passing on a rich heritage to future generations.5\n\n8The intention in this paper is not to carry out a comprehensive comparative study of the one-room schoolhouse era in the US Midwest and Norway, nor to do a wide survey of the heritage field in these two countries or a deep social analysis of Norwegian and American attitudes. In this paper I will show how two different societies, the American Midwest and Norway, deal with rural education as history and one-room schoolhouses as heritage objects. The objective of this comparative study is to show that what at first sight seems identical - the objects of cultural heritage themselves \u2013 in fact reflects difference attitudes to the past. An examination of the motives for preservation reveals the ideological and political reasons for spending money, time, and energy of volunteers on preservation of schoolhouses. My intention is not to promote some new argument for the preservation of schoolhouses, but by the comparative study to show two different approaches to these issues lead to contrasting heritage strategies.\n\n# 1.2 Empirical material: theoretical and methodological approach\n\n9My theoretical approach to the issue implies that significance, heritage value assessment and chosen narratives are a social construction dependent on the purpose which the story or the heritage object is intended to have. 6 The different ways we choose to tell the story of one-room schoolhouses reflect differences in the two societies under examination, differences that describe various values and virtues and the different aims of the preservation of built heritage. The written and spoken history of education, preserved schoolhouses and public school museums are not reflections of a true history, but a selection, interpretation and even construction made to fit our contemporary need and our comprehension of the past. Similar approaches have also been applied by researchers dealing with schoolhouses such as Jonathan Zimmerman: \u2018We tailor the past to serve the present, all the time. But Americans are probably more likely to do it when they encounter an icon like the little red school house; which is so widely shared and loved\u2019.7\n\n10Such quotations are in line with the social constructivist theoretical approach applied in my research. This implies that in the presentation of the historic setting I will neither question whether the statements in the books and papers are \u2018historic facts\u2019 nor examine the sources used in these books. Instead my intention is to show how similarities and differences in the perception and interpretation of the one-room schoolhouse era occur in the popular literature and official and institutionalized documents, and finally in the way the two societies choose to tell the one-room schoolhouse story.\n\n11My empirical material consist primarily listed schoolhouses in the archives of the State Historical Society of Iowa, and the listed schoolhouses in Wisconsin, widely distributed books, publications promoted through the Country School Association of America (CSAA), and publications in the libraries of the Iowa and Wisconsin Historical Societies. By no means is my sample of literature meant to cover the entire one-room schoolhouse story, but it is fair to say that the selection is representative of the large amount of schoolhouse literature.\n\n# 1.3 The schoolhouse\n\n12Small one-room schoolhouses are still visible in the rural landscape of the Midwest and Norway if you know what characterizes these often anonymous buildings. To show how common and widespread this institution was, some statistics are useful. Altogether more than 200,000 one-room schoolhouses were built in the rural areas of the USA, mostly in the Midwest, where more than 90,000 of these quite simple buildings were erected.In Norway more than 5,200 schoolhouses were built between 1860 and 1920. The Midwest had a rural population of approximately 17 million inhabitants in 1920 whereas the rural population in Norway at the same time was 1.4 million: that means, at the beginning of the twentieth century, one schoolhouse for every 188 inhabitants in the Midwest, whereas rural Norway had one schoolhouse for every 340 inhabitants. 8\n\n13In the US, the schoolhouses developed from simple log buildings built by the first pioneers to the typical balloon-framed, wooden-sided, white-painted one-room schoolhouses that could be found in profusion in the Midwest in the early twentieth century. Although most schoolhouses in fact were white, the term \u2018little red schoolhouse\u2019 has been commonly used for these buildings. The first schoolhouses were built by local farmers according to local building traditions.9 Although a number of architect sketches of schoolhouses were made in the second half of the 19th century, contributing to the establishment a well-defined architecture, most farmers built their schoolhouses according to local tradition, but inspired by neighboring schoolhouses.10 Sometimes the schoolhouses were given simple decoration on the front, and in the late nineteenth century a bell-tower was often added. The schoolhouse usually consists of one classroom, windows on either one or two walls, a simple entrance on the front side and in rare cases added cloakrooms or a vestibule.11 Although there was some variety in design, materials and building traditions, the result was a collection of relatively homogeneous structures, whose conformity is merely a result of form following function.\n\n14Studies of Norwegian schoolhouses show more or less the same picture.12 Local farmers built the schoolhouses according to local building traditions. In 1863 the Norwegian government printed sketches which were meant to be used by local communities, but so far no schoolhouses based on these instructions have been found. In 1886 the government once more drew up new guidelines for schoolhouses to ensure better schooling conditions. This led to a new generation of schoolhouses with larger windows, placed side by side, and after a while the schoolhouses developed from anonymous buildings to typical schoolhouses easy to distinguish from other buildings. There are some minor differences between the Norwegian and the Midwestern schoolhouses. Bell-towers never occur on Norwegian schoolhouses, and the entrance is usually on one of the long sides of the building, seldom on the gable end, as in the Midwest. In Norway there is always a vestibule or cloakroom, and often a separate room for the teacher. There is a general lack of decoration on the Norwegian schoolhouses, with the exception of a couple of schoolhouses erected in the late nineteenth century that were sparsely decorated in accordance with the new late Victorian style, with wooden ornaments around the windows and on the gables.\n\n15In the early twentieth century the schoolhouses in Norway became more standardized and the local variations vanished. This was partly a consequence of regulations, but more a general pattern where uniform modern architectural design was spread in all corners of the country.13 It is more difficult to see standardization of the schoolhouse in the Midwest, but there is a general tendency of putting more effort into design and embellishment in the late 19th century. Both in Europe and the US local vernacular variation faded in favor of a new widespread homogeneous design. From an architectural point of view one can see some minor differences in shape, construction and function, but the majority of schoolhouses in Norway and the Midwest do not represent an outstanding architectural achievement. As a group they represent a humble group of architecture.\n\n16Although there are some minor differences in the architecture and building construction between the Norwegian and Midwestern schoolhouses, and some variations in the climatic conditions, the variety does not explain the different fortune of the schoolhouses, neither the suitability for any kind of future use nor the possibility of preservation. The different approach to preservation has to been found elsewhere, most importantly in the contemporary culture within which the schoolhouse existed.\n\n17Although the Scandinavian population in the Midwest was substantial, the footprint of the first generations of immigrants in the second half of the nineteenth century is difficult to spot in the history of education and in the schoolhouse architecture \u2013 partly because the Norwegians did not bring with them an established tradition of public education When the new Norwegian school law was under construction in the 1850s, agents of the Norwegian government were sent to North America to collect information about the well-functioning education system in the US.14\n\n18During the late 1930s and in the 1950s and 1960s, most of the one-room schoolhouses went out of use, both in the USA and Norway, owing to consolidations, demands for better education and better means of transportation. When the schoolhouses were built in the US and Norway, they were located within walking distance of the pupils\u2019 homes, but after World War II the location of schools was merely dependent on how far it was acceptable for pupils to travel by bus. The thousands of redundant schoolhouses were sold, torn down, given to the local community as meeting-houses or often just abandoned.\n\nHesthammar School in Norway.\n\n(Photo. L. Mydland 2009)\n\n# 1.4 School reform in Norway: motivation and resistance\n\n19The nineteenth century was a period of social, economic, political and cultural development in the new and old worlds alike. Both in the Midwest and in Norway the majority of inhabitants lived in rural areas. The second half of the nineteenth century was a turbulent period in Norway. The country was united with Sweden, but had its own government. Economically and socially, it was a time of change, people moving from rural areas to areas with industrial development. When the old traditional farming and fishing communities met the new economy, social and cultural realities altered. People had the opportunity to choose whether to stay or to move. They could even join the hundreds of thousands of migrants who had decided to head for the Promised Land in the west.\n\n20The educational development in nineteenth-century Norway represented a shift from illiteracy to basic knowledge in terms of the three \u2018Rs\u2019, reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic. The educational system in rural areas in the first half of the nineteenth century was poor, and permanent school buildings were rare. The first Norwegian legislation regarding education, dating from 1739, was initiated by the Lutheran Church to prepare children for confirmation. Most of the schooling activities were carried out in private homes which gave this institution the Norwegian name *omgangsskole* because the teacher moved from house to house during the year.15 After finishing the o*mgangsskole*, quite a high number of children were still illiterate - but they could recite the catechism by heart.\n\n21The comprehensive school reform in Norway in 1860, consisting of better teacher training, a wider range of subjects, more school hours and better educational books, was part of a political movement. It both reflected and supported the social and economic changes of the second half of the nineteenth century. As a consequence of the reform, communities where at least 30 pupils could walk to school every day were obliged to build permanent schoolhouses in each of the newly established school districts. The intention behind the school reform was to strengthen the education system and to establish common, democratic institutions, locally-based but national in terms of their organization.\n\n22The response to the new school reform differed per region and class. Local traditions, anxiety for changes, new taxes, skepticism about governmental direction, and finally, yet importantly, strong religious conservatism presented obstacles to school reform. The traditional home-schoolingwhere parents could watch over their children\u2019s education was preferred to sending children to a schoolhouse where a teacher was in charge.The new school legislation was therefore not welcomed in all regions and local communities, and in several parishes the inhabitants obstructed the reforms. Opposition to the school reforms was strong until the very end of the nineteenth century, and in some areas, as late as 1890, 48% of the parishes still had home-schooling, where children often used the New Testament as their reader.16\n\n23The drive for educational reform in the mid-nineteenth century was found first and foremost among people and organizations with progressive political views; academics, and people concerned with modern development. They saw education as an essential premise for establishing and developing a democratic nation, a matter of necessity in the new modern society. Some more conservative groups supported school reform as a tool to prevent labor-class activities and the growth of sectarian congregations, believing that a public education system would guide these people back to civil fellowship and the established church.\n\n24Although the law delegated the establishment of local schools and local school boards to the local communities, the curriculum, the training of teachers and the school as an institution were directed by the government. The great geographical and cultural diversity of Norway was only to a limited degree reflected in education, its organization and its content.\n\n# 1.5 The motivation for establishing schools in the American Midwest: building a nation\n\n25The land ordinance of 1785 governing the vast areas beyond the Appalachians provided that governmental land should be divided into townships and sections. Usually, section number 16 was set aside to support education. The revenue from this section formed the nucleus of an educational fund that allowed the creation of a system of public education. The late nineteenth century, the post-civil war period, represented an era of modernization in the development of the US, including the establishment of a federal bureau of education, and little by little compulsory attendance laws in the second half of the nine\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_MuFMIj3QlGObIGGmyqt1DqBp\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Leidulf Mydland 2012 article grassroots heritage volunteers 'Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research' NIKU 2012 'heritage journal' 'International Journal of Heritage Studies' 'community' 'volunteers' 'grassroots'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Identifying heritage values in local communities\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/254314494_Identifying_heritage_values_in_local_communities\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate how the local understanding of heritage relates to its official understanding in a Norwegian context.Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 1: identifying-heritage-values-in-local-communities\nURL: https:\/\/www.bohrium.com\/paper-details\/identifying-heritage-values-in-local-communities\/813369553076617216-8833\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate how the local understanding of heritage relates to its official understanding in a Norwegian context.Read more\n\n---\n\nResult 2: Leidulf Mydland - Norwegian Research Information Repository\nURL: https:\/\/nva.sikt.no\/research-profile\/385937\n2012.

HBTs can provide faster switching speeds than silicon bipolar transistors mainly because of reduced base resistance and collector-to-substrate capacitance.\nQ: When both the junctions of bipolar junction transistor (BJT) are in forward biased, then in which region will BJT operate?\nA: Saturation Region of BJT The BJT operates in the saturation region when its collector current is not dependent on the base current and has reached a maximum. The condition for this to happen is that both the base-emitter and the base-collector junctions should be forward-biased.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_6lhTPl9PuMF94ioye4mt24TK\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Dangla 1987 CNET 'France Telecom' '1987' conference 'West Germany' 'pages 213-215' Alexandre Harmand Dubon-Chevallier 'CNET' 'INRIA' 1987 paper '213-215'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: Dangla 1987 CNET 'France Telecom' '1987' conference 'West Germany' 'pages 213-215' Alexandre Harmand Dubon-Chevallier 'CNET' 'INRIA' 1987 paper '213-215'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_gYGF68GR6niPnEsZV3g3f58L\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications 1987 heterojunction transistor conference 1987 CNET 'Dangla' 'Alexandre' 'Harmand' 'Dubon-Chevallier' 'Ankri' 'CNET' 1987 proceedings\\\", \\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Centre national d'\u00e9tudes des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications | Related Institutions\nURL: https:\/\/scispace.com\/institutions\/centre-national-d-etudes-des-telecommunications-1ib90f2t?paper_page=179\nFind 1828 researchers\/authors,1828 research papers from Centre national d'\u00e9tudes des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications on SciSpace.

The investigation characterized the resulting products, assessed how these modifications impacted surface activity and cell-lysing potential, and explored the altered affinity for certain divalent cations.

It was in the 13th century the Ajuran first appeared and began gaining power. For several centuries they exerted strong political influence on the inland pastoralists, while also embracing coastal trade and infrastructure.[16] The sultanate functioned for approximately three centuries.[9]\n\n### Origins and the House of Garen\n\n[edit]The House of GareenKnown members |\n|---|\n|\n\nThe House of Garen was the ruling hereditary dynasty of the Ajuran Empire.[17][18] Its origin lies in the Garen Kingdom that during the 13th century ruled parts of the Somali Region of Ethiopia.[19] With the migration of Somalis from the northern half of the Horn region southwards, new cultural and religious orders were introduced, influencing the administrative structure of the dynasty.[20]\n\nA system of governance began to evolve into an Islamic government. Through their genealogical Baraka, which came from the saint *Balad* (who was known to have come from outside the Kingdom).[21][22][23]\n\n### Rise to prominence and dominance\n\n[edit]The Ajuran gradually became a notable and respected empire.[3] They rose to dominance in the interior of the Banaadir region in the late 1300s, after which they maintained hegemony for approximately three centuries. The introduction of a great variety of technological innovations are attributed to the empire, such as systems of dykes and dams on the Shabelle river, large homes and stone fortifications along with the creation of large stone wells, many of which were still in use well into the 20th century. Notably, the Ajuran were the first to impose a regular system of tribute on the surrounding populations.[24] The empire fielded a powerful army which employed firearms towards the end of its dominant period. As a 'water dynasty', the Ajuran monopolized the Jubba and Shabelle rivers through hydraulic engineering.[8]\n\nHistorically, the Sultanate of Mogadishu was confined by the Adal Sultanate in the north.[25][26] Throughout the Middle Ages, the Ajurans routinely aligned themselves politically with the Adalites.[27][28] Described as one country by Ibn Battuta, a journey to Mogadishu from the town of Zeila took him eight weeks to complete.[29][30] The Ajuran Empire's sphere of influence in the Horn of Africa was among the largest in the region.[31][32] At the height of its reach, the empire covered most of southern Somalia as well as eastern Ethiopia,[12][33] with its domain at one point extending from Hobyo in the north to Kismayo in the south, and Qelafo in the west.[34][35][36]\n\n### Ajuran-Portuguese battles\n\n[edit]\nThe European Age of Discovery brought Europe's then superpower the Portuguese Empire to the coast of East Africa, which enjoyed a flourishing trade with foreign nations. The southeastern city-states of Kilwa, Mombasa, Malindi, Pate and Lamu were all systematically sacked and plundered by the Portuguese.[37] Trist\u00e3o da Cunha then set his eyes on Ajuran territory, where the Battle of Barawa was fought.[38][39] After a long period of engagement, the Portuguese soldiers burned the city and looted it.[40][41] Fierce resistance by the local populace and soldiers resulted in the failure of the Portuguese to permanently occupy the city, and the inhabitants who had fled to the interior eventually returned and rebuilt the city.[42][43][44]\n\nAfter Barawa, Trist\u00e3o set sail for Mogadishu, the richest city on the East African coast.[45][46] Word had spread of what had happened in Barawa, and a large troop mobilization took place. Many horsemen, soldiers and battleships in defense positions were guarding the city. Nevertheless, Trist\u00e3o opted to storm and attempt to conquer the city, although every officer and soldier in his army opposed this, fearing certain defeat if they were to engage their opponents in battle. Trist\u00e3o heeded their advice and sailed for Socotra instead.[47][48]\n\nOver the next decades tensions remained high and the increased contact between Somali sailors and Ottoman corsairs worried the Portuguese who sent a punitive expedition under Jo\u00e3o de Sep\u00falveda, where he bombarded Mogadishu and captured Turkish vessels, compelling its ruler to sign a peace deal with the Portuguese. Barawa would also sign peace with the Portuguese after being sacked.[50][51] The Ottoman-Somali cooperation against the Portuguese on the Indian Ocean reached a high point in the 1580s when Ajuran clients of the coastal cities began to cooperate with the Arabs and Swahilis under Portuguese rule and sent an envoy to the Turkish corsair Mir Ali Bey for a joint expedition against the Portuguese. He agreed and was joined by a Somali fleet in order to attack the Portuguese colonies in Southeast Africa.[52]\n\nThe Somali-Ottoman offensive managed to drive out the Portuguese from several important cities such as Pate, Mombasa and Kilwa. However, the Portuguese governor sent envoys to Portuguese India requesting a large Portuguese fleet. This request was answered and it reversed the previous offensive of the Muslims into one of defense. The Portuguese armada managed to re-take most of the lost cities and began punishing their leaders, but they refrained from attacking Mogadishu, securing the city's autonomy in the Indian Ocean.[55][56] The Ottoman Empire would remain an economic partner.[12] Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries the Ajurans successively defied Portuguese hegemony on the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.[57][58][59][60]\n\n### Muslim migrations\n\n[edit]From the late 15th and up until the 17th centuries saw the arrival of Muslim families from Arabia, Persia, India and Spain to the Ajuran realm of territories, the majority of whom settled in the coastal provinces. Some migrated because of the instability in their respective regions, as was the case with the Hadhrami families from Yemen and Muslims from Spain fleeing the Inquisition.[61][62] Others came to conduct business or for religious purposes. Due to their strong tradition in religious learning, the new Muslim communities also enjoyed high status among the Somali ruling elite and commoners.[63][64]\n\n#### Bale\n\n[edit]The most famous Somali scholar of Islam from the Ajuraan period is Sheikh Hussein, who was born in Merca, one of the power jurisdiction and cultural centers of the Ajuran Empire.[65] He is credited with converting the Sidamo people living in the area of what is now the Bale Province, Ethiopia to Islam.[66] He is also credited with establishing the Sultanate of Bale.[67][68]\n\nDespite the Bale Sultanate not being directly under Ajuran rule, the two kingdoms were deeply connected and Bale was heavily influenced by Ajuran. His tomb lies in the town of Sheikh Hussein in what is considered the most sacred place in the country for Ethiopian Muslims, in particular those of Oromo ethnic descent.[69][70]\n\n### Gaal Madow Wars\n\n[edit]In the mid-17th century, the Oromo people collectively began expanding from their homeland towards the southern Somali coast at a time when the Ajurans were at the height of their power.[71] The Garen rulers conducted several military expeditions known as the *Gaal Madow* *Wars,* on the Oromo invaders, converting those that were captured to Islam.[72][73][74][75]\n\n### Fall of Benadir and Southern Somalia\n\n[edit]The Ajuran Empire slowly declined in power at the end of the 17th century. In this period the rulers of the empire abandoned Sharia, became oppressive and enacted heavy taxation.[9] The dethronement of the Muzaffar clients in Mogadishu and other coastal cities by the Abgaal imam who then established the Hiraab Imamate taking residence in Mogadishu was a significant setback,[76] and the defeat of the Silcis vassals by a former Ajuran general in the interior of the state, Ibrahim Adeer, who established the Gobroon dynasty.[77][78] By the early 1700s there was effectively no trace of Ajuran left in Banaadir.[24]\n\nTaxation and the practice of primae noctis were the main catalysts for the revolts against Ajuran rulers.[79] The loss of port cities and fertile farms meant that much needed sources of revenue were lost to the rebels.[78] Somali maritime enterprise significantly declined after the collapse of the Ajuran Empire. However, other principalities such as the Isaaq Sultanate, Warsangali Sultanate, Majeerteen Sultanate, and the Sultanate of Hobyo in a way ensured its continuity.[80]\n\n## Administration\n\n[edit]The Ajuran nobility used many of the typical Somali aristocratic and court titles, with the Garen rulers styled Imam.[81] These leaders were the empire's highest authority, and counted multiple Sultans, Emirs, and Kings as clients or vassals. The Garen rulers also had seasonal palaces in Mareeg, Qelafo and Merca, important cities in the Empire were Mogadishu and Barawa. The state religion was Islam, and thus law was based on Sharia.[82][83][84]\n\n- Imam \u2013 Head of State\n[85] - Emir \u2013 Commander of the armed forces and navy\n- Na'ibs \u2013 Viceroys\n[86] - Wazirs \u2013 Tax and revenue collectors\n- Qadis \u2013 Chief Judges\n\n## Citizenry\n\n[edit]\nThrough their control of the region's wells, the Garen rulers effectively held a monopoly over their nomadic subjects as they were the only hydraulic empire in Africa during their reign. Large wells made out of limestone were constructed throughout the state, which attracted Somali and Oromo nomads with their livestock.[87] The centralized regulations of the wells made it easier for the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials who would act as mediators. Long distance caravan trade, a long-time practice in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran times. Today, numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the medieval period.[88]\n\nWith the centralized supervision of the Ajuran, farms in Afgooye, Kismayo and other areas in the Jubba and Shabelle valleys increased their productivity. A system of irrigation ditches known locally as *Kelliyo* fed directly from the Shebelle and Jubba rivers into the plantations where sorghum, maize, beans, grain and cotton were grown during the *gu* (Spring in Somali) and *xagaa* (Summer in Somali) seasons of the Somali calendar. This irrigation system was supported by numerous dikes and dams. To determine the average size of a farm, a land measurement system was also invented with *moos*, *taraab* and *guldeed* being the terms used.[89]\n\n## Taxation\n\n[edit]The State collected tribute from the farmers in the form of harvested products like durra, sorghum and bun, and from the nomads, cattle, camels and goats. The collecting of tribute was done by a wazir. Luxury goods imported from foreign lands were also presented as gifts to the Garen rulers by the coastal sultans of the state.\n\nA political device that was implemented by the Garen rulers in their realm was a form of *ius primae noctis*,[90] which enabled them to create marriages that enforced their hegemonic rule over all the important groups of the empire. The rulers would also claim a large portion of the bride's wealth, which at the time was 100 camels.[87]\n\nFor trade, the Ajuran Empire minted its own Ajuran currency.[91] It also utilized the Mogadishan currency originally minted by the Sultanate of Mogadishu, which later became incorporated into the Ajuran Empire.[55] Mogadishan coins have been found as far away as present-day United Arab Emirates in the Middle East.[92]\n\n## Military\n\n[edit]\nThe Ajuran State had a standing army with which the governors ruled and protected their subjects. The bulk of the army consisted of recruited soldiers who did not have any loyalties to the traditional Somali clan system, thereby making them more reliable.[93][94][95] The soldiers were recruited from the inter-riverine area; other recruits came from the surrounding nomadic region. Arab, Persian and Turkish mercenaries were at times employed as well.[96][97]\n\nIn the early period, the army's weapons consisted of traditional Somali weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, battle axes, and bows. The Empire received assistance from the Ottoman Empire, and with the import of firearms through the Muzzaffar port of Mogadishu, the army began acquiring muskets and cannons.[98][99]\n\nThe Ottomans would also remain a key ally during the Ajuran-Portuguese wars. Horses used for military purposes were raised in the interior, and numerous stone fortifications were erected to provide shelter for the army in the coastal districts.[100] In each province, the soldiers were under the supervision of a military commander known as an Emir.[94] The coastal areas and the lucrative Indian Ocean trade was protected by a navy.[52]\n\n## Urban and maritime centers\n\n[edit]\nThe urban centers of Merca, Mogadishu, Barawa, and their respective ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating from the interior of the state.[101] The farming communities of the hinterland brought their products to the coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained foreign commerce with ships sailing to and from Arabia, India, Venice, Persia, Egypt, Portugal, and as far as China.[102][103][104][105]\n\nVasco da Gama, who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century[106] noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its centre and many mosques with cylindrical minarets.[107][108] In the 16th century, Duarte Barbosa noted that many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya sailed to Mogadishu with cloths and spices for which they in return received gold, wax and ivory.[109][110] Barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat, wheat, barley, horses, and fruit on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants.[111][112]\n\nMogadishu, the center of a thriving weaving industry known as *toob benadir* (specialized for the markets in Egypt and Syria),[113] together with Merca and Barawa also served as transit stops for Swahili merchants from Mombasa and Malindi and for the gold trade from Kilwa.[114] There were Jewish merchants from the Hormuz who brought their Indian textile and fruits to the Somali coast in exchange for grain and wood.[115][116]\n\nTrading relations were established with Malacca in the 15th century,[117] with cloth, ambergris and porcelain being the main commodities of the trade.[118] In addition, giraffes, zebras and incense were exported to the Ming Empire of China.[119] Hindu merchants from Surat and Southeast African merchants from Pate seeking to bypass both the Portuguese blockade and Omani interference used the ports of Merca and Barawa (which were out of the two powers' jurisdiction) to conduct their trade in safety.[120]\n\n### Major cities\n\n[edit]The Ajuran Empire was an influential Somali kingdom that held sway over several cities and towns in central and southern Somalia during the Middle Ages.[121] With the fall of the Sultanate, a number of these settlements continued to prosper, eventually becoming major cities in present-day Somalia.[122][123] A few were abandoned or destroyed:\n\n- Capital\n\n- Mareeg (initially) (town in the Galguduud region of Somalia)\n- Qelafo (town in the Somali Region of Ethiopia)\n- Merca (port city in the Lower Shebelle region of Somalia)\n- Mogadishu (harbor city and current capital of Somalia)\n\n- Port cities\n\n- Hobyo (harbor city in the Mudug region of Somalia)\n- Eyl (port town in the Nugal region of Somalia)\n- El Buur (town in the Galgaduud region of Somalia)\n- Kismayo (port city in the Lower Juba region of Somalia)\n- Barawa (port town in the Lower Shebelle region of Somalia)\n- Warsheikh (port town in the Middle Shebelle region of Somalia)\n\n- Other cities\n\n- Afgooye (town in the Lower Shebelle region of Somalia)\n- Baidoa (a city in the Bay region of Somalia)\n- Gondershe (abandoned, but now a popular tourist attraction site)\n- Hannassa (abandoned)\n- Ras Bar Balla (abandoned)\n\n## Economy\n\n[edit]The Ajuran Empire relied on agriculture and trade for most of its income. Major agricultural towns were located on the Shebelle and Jubba rivers, including Kismayo and Afgooye. Situated at the junction of some of the busiest medieval trade routes, the Ajuran and its clients were active participants in the East African gold trade, the Silk Road commerce, trade in the Indian Ocean, and commercial enterprise as far as East Asia.[12][124]\n\nThe Ajuran Empire also minted its own Ajuran currency. Many medieval bronze coins inscribed with the names of Ajuran Sultans have been found in the coastal Benadir province, in addition to pieces from Muslim rulers of Southern Arabia and Persia.[91]\n\nThrough the use of commercial vessels, compasses, multiple port cities, light houses and other technology, the merchants of the Ajuran Empire did brisk business with traders from the following states:\n\n| Trading countries in Asia | Imports | Exports |\n|---|---|---|\n| Ming Empire | celadon wares and their currency | horses, exotic animals, and ivory |\n| Mughal Empire | cloth and spices | gold, wax and wood |\n| Malacca Sultanate | ambergris and porcelain | cloth and gold |\n| Maldive Islands | cowries | musk and sheep |\n| Kingdom of Jaffna | cinnamon and their currency | cloth |\n| Trading countries in the Near East | ||\n| Ottoman Empire | muskets and cannons | textiles |\n| Safavid Persian Empire | textiles and fruit | grain and wood |\n| Trading countries in Europe | ||\n| Portuguese Empire | gold | cloth |\n| Venetian Empire | sequins | \u2013 |\n| Dutch Empire | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Trading countries in Africa | ||\n| Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo) | \u2013 | cloth |\n| Adal Sultanate | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Ethiopian Empire | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Swahili Coast | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Monomopata | gold and ivory | spices and cloth |\n| Gonderine Ethiopian Empire | gold \n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"# Open Result 0\n# Sultanate of the Geledi\n\nSultanate of the Geledi | |||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1695\u20131911 | |||||||||\n| Status | 1695-1901 independent kingdom, Protectorate of Italy from 1902-1911[1] | ||||||||\n| Capital | Afgooye | ||||||||\n| Common languages | Somali \u00b7 Arabic | ||||||||\n| Religion | Sunni Islam | ||||||||\n| Demonyms | Somali, Geledi | ||||||||\n| Government | Monarchy | ||||||||\n\u2022 | Ibrahim Adeer | ||||||||\n\u2022 | Mahamud Ibrahim | ||||||||\n\u2022 | Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim | ||||||||\n\u2022 | Ahmed Yusuf Mahamud | ||||||||\n\u2022 | Osman Ahmed | ||||||||\n| Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Imam Sheikh | |||||||||\n\u2022 Late-17th century\u2013mid 18th century | Ibrahim Adeer | ||||||||\n\u2022 1878\u2013early 1920s | Osman Ahmed | ||||||||\n| History | |||||||||\n| 1695 | |||||||||\n\u2022 Complete integration into Italian Somaliland | 1911 | ||||||||\n| |||||||||\n| Today part of | Somalia |\n\nThe **Sultanate of the Geledi** (Somali: *Saldanadda Geledi*, Arabic: \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0646\u0629 \u063a\u0644\u062f\u064a) also known as the **Gobroon dynasty**,[2] was a Somali kingdom that ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the late-17th century to the early 20th century. The Sultanate was governed by the Gobroon dynasty. It was established by the Geledi soldier Ibrahim Adeer, who had defeated various vassals of the Ajuran Sultanate and elevated the Gobroon to wield significant political power. Following Mahamud Ibrahim's consolidation, the dynasty reached its apex under Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim, who successfully modernized the Geledi economy and eliminated regional threats with the Conquest of Bardera in 1843,[3] and would go on to receive tribute from Said bin Sultan, the ruler of the Omani Empire.[4] Geledi Sultans had strong regional ties and built alliances with the Pate and Witu Sultanates on the Swahili coast.[5] Trade and Geledi power would continue to remain strong until the death of the well known Sultan Ahmed Yusuf in 1878. The sultanate was eventually incorporated into Italian Somaliland in 1911.[6]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]| History of Somalia |\n|---|\n| Somalia portal |\n\n### Origins of the sultanate\n\n[edit]At the end of the 17th century, the Ajuran Sultanate was in its decline and various vassals were breaking free or being absorbed by new Somali powers. One of these powers was the Silcis Sultanate, which began consolidating its rule over the Afgooye region. Ibrahim Adeer led the revolt against the Silcis ruler Umar Abrone and his oppressive daughter, Princess Fay.[7] After his victory over the Silcis, Ibrahim then proclaimed himself Sultan and subsequently founded the *Gobroon dynasty*.\n\nThe Geledi Sultanate was a Rahanweyn Kingdom ruled by the noble Geledi which held sway over the Jubba and Shabelle rivers in the interior and the Benadir coast. The Geledi Sultanate had enough power to force southern Arabians to pay tribute.[8]\n\nThe nobles within the Geledi claim descent from Abadir Umar ar-Rida. He had three other brothers, Fakhr and with two others of whom their names are given differently as Shams, Umudi, Alahi and Ahmed. Together they were known as *Afarta Timid*, 'the four who came', indicating their origins from Arabia. Claims of descent from Arabia was mainly for legitimacy reasons.[9]\n\n### Conflict with the Bimaal and Haji Ali Majeerteen\n\n[edit]#### The Bimaal\n\n[edit]The first documented conflict between the Geledi and Bimaal Somali clans would be the Battle of Adaddey Suleyman. After Geledi Sultan Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim won a battle at the island of Siyu over the Salafist Somalis led by Haji Ali Majeerteen, the Witu Sultan would send aid to sultan Yusuf before he departed to meet the Bimaal rebels, who refused to join his battles against the extremist Salafist rulers in Bardera. Even allying them in Mungiya.[10] The two forces finally would clash at Adadday Suleyman in 1848, a village near Merca. The Bimaal defended themselves, and after three days of fierce war, Sultan Yusuf Mahamud and his brother were killed, and ultimately lost against the Omani aligned Bimaal rebels in 1848.[11]\n\nYears later, in 1878, Sultan Yusuf's son;Ahmed Yusuf Mahamud made preparations to finally defeat the Bimaal, as his father failed to. Ahmed's brother Abobokur Yusuf warned him, not to go through with the attack as the Geledi had an influential ally refuse to join the upcoming campaign. Sultan Ahmed, Reprimanding his brother, said he could watch the women & children then. With Abobokur eventually deciding to accompany his brother, the Geledi marched out to meet the Bimaal at Cagaaran, at town beside Merca. The two forces would enter a fierce engagement, the Geledi initially tiding the battle in their favor, however, the Geledi would eventually lose to the Bimaals, and the Geledi Sultan's army would be routed. Killing both Sultan Ahmed and his brother Abobokur in battle.[12][13]\n\nUpon seeing the bodies of the dead noble men, the women of the Merca reportedly marveled at the beauty of Ahmed Yusuf and his brother, which resulted in a public uproar with them demanding a proper funeral for the late Sultan.[14]\n\n#### Haji Ali Majeerteen\n\n[edit]Haji Ali Majeerteen arrived in Merca and formed an alliance with the Bimaal clan. He settled in the area near Merca with the consent of the Bimaal clan and began his Dawah activities and education programs. It is established that Ali had secret plans for himself to form a colony at the port of Mungiya, the point where Shabelle River was closest to the Indian Ocean coast, and had obtained permission from Sultan Yusuf of the Geledi to do so. However, initially, he attempted to play the role of a peacemaker between Sultan Yusuf and the Bimaal clan in their conflict, sending a letter to Sultan Yusuf requesting him that he accepts his reconciliation proposal. The Sultan, upon hearing of the proposal refused the offer, feeling disrespected that a newcomer would interfere with his internal affairs. Haji Ali was furious and in response declared war against the Geledi and his men raided a string villages near the capital of the Geledi, Afgooye. This included the coastal city of Barawa. Yusuf and the Geledi army confronted Haji Ali's well armed followers which mainly hailed from the Majeerteen tribe, and annihilated them in battle. Munginya was burnt to the ground and Haji Ali's ambitious dreams ended.[15]\n\n#### Haji Ali\u2019s response\n\n[edit]Haji Ali penned a letter he sent to the people of Barawa on the Banaadir coast, in that he considered the Geledi Sultanate a polity adhering to a deviated sect, (Firqa Al-Dalah). According to him, this deviation had to be stamped out through either Dawah or ultimate Jihad.\n\nFollowing his defeat against the Sultans of the Geledi, Sheikh Ali stated that\n\n\"In reality, our [death], if you are among the deviated sect which Sultan Yusuf leads, there is no relation between us, and your blood will not be saved from us.\"\n\n\n\u2014 Haji Ali Majeerteen\n\nThe hardline stance of Haji Ali, to the propagation of Islam among his people, his mobilization of armed followers, and his siding with the Bimaal clan against Geledi Sultanate displays the militant ideology akin to the Bardera Jama, and the new Wahhabi tendency that was emerging across the Muslim world at the time.[16]\n\n\n\n## Bureaucracy\n\n[edit]The Sultanate of Geledi exerted a strong centralized authority during its existence and possessed all of the institutions and trappings of an integrated modern state: a functioning bureaucracy, a hereditary nobility, titled aristocrats, a taxing system, conducting foreign policy, a state flag as well as a standing army.[17][18] The great sultanate also maintained written records of their activities which still exist in museums.[19]\n\nThe Geledi Sultanate's capital city was at Afgooye where the rulers resided. The kingdom had a number of castles forts with a variety of different architectures in various areas within its realm, including a fortress at Luuq and a citadel at Bardera.[20]\n\nAt its height, the Sultanate covered all Rahanweyn territories within present-day Somalia, alongside minor territories in modern day Somali Galbeed. This is what some refer to as the Geledi confederacy. The confederacy was not only confined to Digil and Mirifle but incorporated other Somalis such as Bimaal, Sheekhaal, and Wacdaan. To reign such a diverse Sultanate, the rulers promoted a policy of indirect and flexible administration. They allowed the tribal chiefs, Imams, Sheikhs (religious figures), and Akhiyaars (notable elders) of the community to play significant roles in the administration of the Sultanate. The Geledi rulers were not only the political head of the Sultanate but also considered religious leaders.[21] Akhiyaars were elders who would reconcile and solve cases such as murders and recite Al-Fatiha after adjudication. Between two different lineages groups if an injustice was committed then a *googol* meeting was held between the Akhiyaar of both.[22]\n\nThe Sultan would have a regular guard consisting of armed slaves to protect him from those who wished harm. The *Ul Hay* would be his intermediaries between the Geledi sub lineages and received his directions and intentions on matters.[23] The symbol of the Sultan's authority was his turban. It would be placed on his head by leading elders of the Abiikarow lineage.[24][2]\n\nClear devolution of power was also present within the politics of the Geledi Sultan delegating certain regions of the sultanate to be managed by close relatives, who wielded significant influence in their own right. Sultan Ahmed Yusuf's administration was described as such by the British Parliament.\n\nThe Somali tribe of Ruhwaina. The Chief of this and other tribes behind Brava, Marka and Mogdisho is Ahmed Yusuf, who resides at Galhed, one day's march or less from the latter town. Two days further inland is Dafert, a large town governed by Aweka Haji, his brother. These are the principal towns of the Ruhwaina. At four, five, and six hours respectively from Marka lie the towns of Golveen (Golweyn), Bulo Mareerta, and Addormo, governed by Abobokur Yusuf, another brother who though nominally under the orders of the first-named chief, levies black-mail on his own account, and negotiates with the governors of Marka and Brava direct. He resides with about 2,000 soldiers principally slaves at Bulo Mareta; the towns of Gulveen which he often visits and Addormo being occupied by somalis growing produce, cattle &c. and doing a large trade with Marka.\n\n[25]The brother of Sultan Ahmed Yusuf, Abobokur Yusuf managed the lands opposite the Banadir ports of Brava & Marka and also received a tribute from Brava. This Abobokur Yusuf was accustomed to send messengers to Brava for tribute, and he drew thence about 2,000 dollars per annum.[25]\n\nDuring the Scramble for Africa period between the 1880s and the first World War, Geledi was bounded to the north by the Huwan Region, to the east by Hobyo Sultanate and Italian leasing of Benadir, and to the south by the British East Africa Protectorate.[26][a]\n\n## Economy\n\n[edit]The Geledi Sultanate maintained a vast trading network, and had trade relations with Arabia, Persia, India, Near East, Europe and the Swahili coast, dominating the East African trade, and minting its own currency, and were recognized as a powerful regional power.[27]\n\nIn the case of the Geledi, wealth accrued to the nobles and to the Sultanate, not only from the market cultivation which it had utilized from the Shebelle and Jubba valleys, but also trade from their involvement in the slave trade and other enterprises such as ivory, cotton, iron, gold, and among many other commodities. Generally, they also raised livestock animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and chickens.[28]\n\nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Gobroon dynasty had turned their religious prestige into formidable political power and were recognized as the rulers of an increasingly centralized and wealthy state. As already mentioned, much of their wealth was based on control over the fertile riverine lands. Using slave labour obtained through the coastal ports, the Geledi gradually shifted their economic base away from its traditional dependency on pastoralism and subsistence agriculture to one built largely on plantation agriculture and production of cash crops such as grain, cotton, maize, sorghum, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, especially bananas, mangos, sugarcane, cotton, tomatoes, squash and much more. The region is traversed by historic caravan routes. Trade on the rivers themselves connected with the coast to the interior markets.[29] During this period, the Somali agricultural output to Arabian markets was so great that the coast of South Somalia came to be known as the *Grain Coast* of Yemen and Oman.[30]\n\nAfgooye, the headquarters of the Sultanate, was an extremely wealthy and large city. Afgooye had some thriving industries such as weaving, shoemaking, tableware, jewellery, pottery and produced various products. Afgooye was the crossroads of caravans bringing ostrich feathers, leopard skins, and aloe in exchange for foreign fabrics, sugar, dates and firearms. They raised numerous livestock animals for meat, milk and ghee. The farmers of Afgooye produced large quantity of fruits and vegetables.[31]\n\nAfgooye merchants would boast of their wealth; one of their wealthiest said\n\n\nMoordiinle iyo mereeyey iyo mooro lidow, maalki jeri keenow kuma moogi malabside. Bring all the wealth of Moordiinle, Mereeyey, and the enclosures of lidow, I scarcely notice it.[31]\n\n## Military\n\n[edit]The Geledi army numbered around 20,000 men in times of peace, with a maximum of 50,000 troops in times of war.[32] The supreme commanders of the army were the Sultan and his brother, who in turn had *Malaakhs* and *Garads* under them. The military was supplied with rifles and cannons by Somali traders of the coastal regions that controlled the East African arms trade.\n\nThe best horse breeds were raised in Luuq and later sent to the army after maturity. They would be used mainly for military purposes, and numerous stone fortifications were erected to provide shelter for the army in the interior and coastal districts. In each province, the soldiers were under the supervision of a military commander known as a Malaakh, and the coastal areas and the Indian Ocean trade were protected by a powerful navy.[33]\n\n## Society\n\n[edit]The Geledi society is divided into three segments; nobles, commoners, and slaves (to use terms adopted by Helander) Each of these castes consist of several lineage groups whose federation formed the Geledi state; the lineages are divided between two moieties. Tolweyne and Yebdaale, each living in its section of the city. The nobles, in the old society, were the ruling group but depended on the support of the commoner lineages.[34]\n\n### Nobility\n\n[edit]The noble section of the society belonged to rulers. However, all members of the Geledi clan were also considered to be of noble stock despite the majority of them not being rulers. Nobility was not only exclusive to the Geledi clan as there were rulers of many districts in the Geledi realm that didn't belong to the Geledi lineage.[34]\n\n### Commoners\n\n[edit]The commoners were typical citizens that mainly consist of non-Geledi Somalis and traditionally consist of urban dwellers, farmers, pastoral nomads as well as officials, merchants, engineers, scholars, soldiers, craftsmen, port workers, and other various professions. The commoners were the majority in the kingdom and were treated as equals.[34]\n\n### Slaves\n\n[edit]The slaves were mostly of Bantu origin and were used for labour. The men would work as agricultural labourers led by their farmer-owners and some would work in construction led by engineers. They would also be employed into the army and were separated from the rest of the Geledi army and were branched as Mamaluks meaning slave soldiers. The women would work as domestic servants and perform a variety of household services for their owners, from providing, cooking, cleaning, and laundry, taking care of children and elderly dependents, and other household errands. They would also be looked down upon for any kind of sexual contact and were deemed as unattractive.[35]\n\nThe Bantus were not exclusive to slavery. Oromos would sometimes be enslaved following raids and wars.[36] However, there were marked differences in terms of the perception, capture, treatment, and duties of the Oromo versus the Bantu slaves. On an individual basis, Oromo subjects were not viewed as racially inferior by their Somali captors.[37] Despite Oromos taking the same roles as the Bantus, they were not treated the same. The most fortunate of the men worked as the officials or bodyguards of the ruler and emirs, or as business managers for rich merchants. They enjoyed significant personal freedom and occasionally held slaves of their own.[38] Prized for their beauty and viewed as legitimate sexual partners, many Oromo women became either wives or concubines of their Somali owners, while others became domestic servants. The most beautiful ones often enjoyed a wealthy lifestyle and became mistresses of the elite or even mothers to rulers.[39]\n\n## Rulers\n\n[edit]**Detailed biographies of the Sultanate's rulers**\n\n| # | Sultan | Reign | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Ibrahim Adeer | late 17th century\u2013mid 18th century | Founded the Geledi Sultanate after defeating the Ajuran Sultanate.

One notable poem was recorded by Virginia Luling in 1989 during her visit to Afgooye. Geledi *laashins* (poets) sang about the ever present issue of land theft by the Somali government. Sultan Subuge was asked to help the community and was reminded of his legendary Gobroon forefathers of the centuries prior.[43]\n\n*The law then was not this law* was performed by the leading *laashins* of Afgooye, Hiraabey, Muuse Cusmaan and Abukar Cali Goitow alongside a few others, addressed to the current leader Sultan Subuge .[43]\n\nHere the richest selection of the poem performed by Goitow\n\nGanaane gubow gaala guuriow Gooble maahinoo Geelidle ma goynin\n\n\nGembi iyo waran guraantiis aa loogu soo gayooday, Gooble\n\nGacalkiisa guri curad aa looga soo guuray Haddana nin walba aa\n\nSoo gamgamohaayo, goofka beereed waa la goostay, gelgeshii\n\nGaashada daaqeysana waa la goostay, gunta intee la geyn doonaa?\n\nGobroontii soo gaartay Gobroontaan ma ahayn, gargooye Ibraahim\n\nCumar Xaaji goodaalka adunyada markii joogeen, Awow Gaduud Cali -\n\nMahinoo - Awow Gaduud Cali Abukar, Yusuf Maxamuud iyo goodaalka\n\nAddunka markii joogeen, ganuunka ganuunkan ma ahayn, Awow\n\nGudgudoome Cumar Adeerow goodaalka aduunka markii joogeen\n\nGanuunka ganuunkan ma ahayn.

It is the center of the Afgooye District. Afgooye is the third largest city of Southwest State.[1] Afgooye is one of the oldest towns on the lower Shebelle valley, 30 kilometers north of Mogadishu. Afgooye is the site of Lafoole college, the first college of education in Somalia, built on the site of the battle of Lafoole of 1896. Afgooye is also known for the Istunka, the annual \"stick fight\" carnival commemorating the New Year in the riverine region. It was a trade center for the Silcis Dynasty in the medieval period then fell under Ajuran rule. Around the late 17th century, Afgooye became the capital of Geledi Sultanate.[2]\n\n## Etymology\n\n[edit]In the Somali language, *Afgooye* translates to split mouth or open\/ split closing.\n\n## Location\n\n[edit]It is situated about 30 kilometres west of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.[3] The Shabelle River passes through the middle of the town.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Medieval Period\n\n[edit]The Silcis Dynasty were a section of Ajuran that governed the Afgooye district. Neither the Silcis nor the Ajuran developed the town, but limited themselves to controlling the caravan routes and collecting taxes and tribute. The Silcis center of power was in Lama Jiidle (present day Afgooye). Lama Jiidle means \"two roads\" in Somali.[4]\n\nThe Silcis imposed taxation on their subject clans, such as the Wacdaan, a fellow subclan of the Gurgate Hawiye, and the Geledi, a Rahanweyn subclan. According to Virginia Luling, \"The Sil'is imposed their dominion on the Geledi, who had to pay as tribute a measure (suus) of grain every day from each household; it was collected and loaded on a camel, others say a donkey. A tax was also imposed on those who brought their stock to water at the river\u201d. Barile also describes the taxes levied by the Silcis.[5]\n\nThe final ruler of the Silcis in Lama Jiidle (Afgooye) was the sultan 'Umur Abukar Abroone. According to Luling, \"His daughter Imbia used to go round collecting the daily tribute of grain, accompanied by her slaves\" from her father's Wacdaan and Geledi subjects. Oral accounts hold that one day, \"when the Sultan's daughter came round to collect the tribute, she got a beating instead of the grain\", as the Geledi refused to pay. When Imbia reported this event to her father, he exclaimed \"waa la i afgooye\", literally \"they have cut off my mouth\", meaning that the regime's source of provision had been terminated. Lama Jiidle's name became Afgooye to commemorate this victory over the Silcis.[6]\n\nThe Geledi mobilized and under Ibrahim Adeer a general who used to serve the Ajuran drove the Silcis out of Afgooye and established the Geledi Sultanate.[7]\n\n### Early Modern\n\n[edit]Afgooye was in its golden age in the early modern period under the reign of the Gobroon dynasty which was not only a powerful military machine but, by its use of Asraar or Ta'daar the feared \"secret mystical language\" was a formidable force in other respects as well. Afgooye at that time was a trading hub center controlling the trade route between the coast and interior. All roads were linked to Afgooye which gave the city immense leverage. During the early 19th century, the city's population was estimated to have exceeded 80,000 making it one of the largest cities in East Africa of that time.[2] The city was surrounded by a large wall with five fortified gates. It had many complex structures such as multi-story high buildings, big palaces in the center, mosques, residential houses, shops, roads, and bridges. They also built an advanced plumbing system, a drainage system, and a sewage system. The city was very vibrant and developed in its time.[8]\n\nThe Sultanate ruled most of the inter-riverine region and Benadir coast. Its headquarters was located in Afgooye which was an extremely wealthy and large city. Afgooye having some thriving industries such as weaving, shoemaking, tableware, jewellery, pottery and produced other various products. Afgooye was the crossroads of caravans bringing ivory, leopard skins, and aloe in exchange for foreign fabrics, sugar, dates, and firearms. Afgooyans also traded livestock and slaves. The outside inhabitants of Afgooye grew sorghum, beans, cotton, bananas, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. The Afgooyans say \"Laka Beere beerwaye\" (you can count on your farm), as opposed to the nomads who counted their camels. Afgooyans raised cows, goats, sheep, and chicken for meat, milk, and ghee. It is said that every household in Afgooye was wealthy and you could not find a single poor person.[2][9]\n\nAfgooye merchants boasted their wealth; one of their wealthiest said\n\n\nMoordiinle iyo Mereeyey iyo mooro lidow, maalki jeri keenow kuma moogi malabside.\n\nBring all the wealth of Moordiinle, Mereeyey, and the enclosures of lidow, I scarcely notice it.[2]\n\n### Italian Somaliland\n\n[edit]At the turn of the 20th century, Afgooye was incorporated into Italian Somaliland. The Italians occupied the town in 1908 and in the process abolished the local slave market.[10] There was also a station in Afgooye on the Mogadishu-Villabruzzi Railway, which connected the town to the capital Mogadishu.\n\n### Modern\n\n[edit]In the 1980s, Afgooye was a common destination for investors from the Gulf States. The Emir of Kuwait also reportedly used to visit the town during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, parts of the town became a place of refuge for many of southern Somalia's internally displaced people.[11]\n\nOn May 25, 2012, Somali government forces backed by AMISOM tanks re-captured Afgooye from Al-Shabaab, which had established a base in the area.[12]\n\n## Istunka Afgooye Festival\n\n[edit]Istunka, also known as *isgaraac*, was the name for annual mock combat festival in Afgooye, which marks the new year and one of the best known tourist attractions in the region.[13][14][15][16]\n\nThe festival was developed during the medieval Ajuran period. It was later expanded upon by Sultan Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon) becoming a centralized tournament separate teams were established, each supported by an assembly of poets, female vocalists and dance groups throughout the duration of the contest.[7]\n\nIn the modern era, the festival evolved into a local attraction; particularly during the 1970s and 80s. It is still practised annually in the town.\n\n## Demographics\n\n[edit]Afgooye has a population of around 79,400 inhabitants.[17] The broader Afgooye District has a total population of 135,012 residents.\nAfgooye District is predominantly inhabited by the Geledi and Garre clans with a small minority of Begedi clan all sub-clans of Digil\/Rahanweyn.[18]\n\n## Geodesy\n\n[edit]Afgooye is a geodetic datum used in Somalia.

This particular unit is recognized for its historical sultanates and a prominent historical figure who, following a period of banishment, established his own coastal dominion. The principal urban center of this newly formed dominion, an ancient port, is noted to have developed as an outpost concurrently with a neighboring settlement, both under the authority of an earlier, formidable medieval empire. This neighboring settlement, also originating in that historical period, was another territory controlled by this extensive empire, which was distinguished by its management of vital watercourses and its far-reaching trade networks before its power waned, enabling one of its own military commanders to rise to prominence. This commander, having previously served the declining empire, successfully broke away to institute his own dynastic sovereignty. The resultant state governed by this commander's lineage held sway over several areas, including a notable town celebrated for an annual traditional combat festival.

Rejecting the traditional biennale format to create a more generative space for art and exchange, DAS\u2019s interdisciplinary programme concentrates its endeavours towards the advancement and promotion of South Asia\u2019s contemporary and historic creative communities, building alliances through shared values with international practices and initiatives. Chief Curator Diana Campbell leads the Summit with international key curators, artists, and thinkers.\n\n##### The Dhaka Art Summit (DAS) is an international, non-commercial research and exhibition platform for art and architecture related to South Asia. With a core focus on Bangladesh, DAS re-examines how we think about these forms of art in both a regional and an international context.\n\nFor each edition of DAS, Bangladeshi artists shortlisted for the Samdani Art Award exhibit their work under the guidance of an international guest curator. Organised in partnership with the Delfina Foundation, the Award has created an internationally recognised platform for the work of young Bangladeshi artists. Many shortlisted artists have later exhibited or acquired by international exhibitions and institutions, such as Tate, SF MoMA, the Kunsthalle Zurich, Gwangju Biennale, Singapore Biennale, Lyon Biennale, Asia Pacific Triennial, Sharjah Biennial, Para Site, and many others.\n\n\nAll of DAS\u2019s exhibitions are supported by an ambitious commissions programme, which invites internationally acclaimed contemporary artists related to South Asia to create new work. Past commissions include Lynda Benglis, Simryn Gill, Po Po, Rasheed Araeen, Damian Ortega, Nilima Sheikh, Monika Sosnowska, Daniel Steegmann Mangrane, along with and some of the most exciting names from the region: Sheela Gowda, Ayesha Sultana, Waqas Khan, Munem Wasif, Zihan Karim, Randhir Singh, Seher Shah, Reetu Sattar, Ramesh Mario Nithiyendran, Kamruzzaman Shahdin, Yasmin Jahan Nupur, Tanya Goel, and many more.\n\nCelebrated for its critically acclaimed exhibitions by local and international arts professionals, many of DAS\u2019s past projects have toured internationally to venues and festivals, including Para Site in Hong Kong; TS1 in Yangon; the Modern Art Museum in Warsaw; the Berlin Biennale; the Gwangju Biennale; the Singapore Biennale; the Queens Museum, New York; Kunsthalle Basel, Switzerland; Artspace in Sydney; the Office for Contemporary Art Norway; the San Jose Museum of Art, USA; the Liverpool Biennial; Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Sri Lanka; Kunsthall Trondheim, Norway; and MAIIAM Contemporary Art Museum, Thailand.\n\n\nFree to the public and ticketless, DAS 2023 drew over half a million visitors across its nine-day duration. Expanding from its initial South Asia mandate, DAS 2018 created new connections between South, South East Asia, and the Indian Ocean belt, exhibiting artists from Thailand, Malaysia, Madagascar, the Philippines, and several other countries. DAS 2020 expanded further to connect widely across the Global South based on shared struggles rather than current geopolitical definitions. DAS 2023 took a planetary approach through the lens of climate change.\n\n\n##### SEVENTH EDITION\n\n### TONDRA\n\nWe are pleased to introduce you to the theme we have been dreaming up with our curators and art mediators for the 7th edition of DAS - TONDRA. The meaning of the word TONDRA in Bangla can be described as a state of existence where reality and dreams collide; a lucid dream that captivates the soul.\n\n\nTONDRA is also a common female name in Bangladesh, which became popular during the mid 1990s-2000s for a character named Tondra in a novel by the Bangladeshi author Humayun Ahmed. Our story of TONDRA emerged from heartbreak expressed by a young visitor at DAS 2023, who wrote messages for a woman named TONDRA on the walls of our exhibition such as \u201cEveryone is here, but you are missing from my life\u201d. His writing style ranged from graffiti to poetry, referring to his Tondra as \u2018a cloudy day\u2019 and other beautiful metaphors that connected his deepest personal feelings for his beloved to the stories and films of Humayun Ahmed.\n\n##### FIFTH EDITION\n\n### DAS 2020\n\n### \u09b8\u099e\u09cd\u099a\u09be\u09b0\u09a3 \/ Seismic Movements\n\nInspired by the geological reading of the word \u2018summit\u2019 as the top of a mountain, Seismic Movements: Dhaka Art Summit 2020 (DAS 2020) considers the various ruptures that have realigned and continue to shift the face of our spinning planet. Seismic movements do not adhere to statist or nationalist frameworks. They join and split apart tectonics of multiple scales and layers; their epicentres don\u2019t privilege historical imperial centres over the so-called peripheries; they can slowly accumulate or violently erupt in an instant.\n\n##### FOURTH EDITION\n\n### DAS 2018\n\nThe fourth edition of the Dhaka Art Summit (DAS) took place from 2 to 10 February 2018, featuring both an Opening Celebration Weekend (February 2\u20134) and a closing Scholars\u2019 Weekend (February 8\u201310), and several tiers of new programming. Produced and primarily funded by the Samdani Art Foundation, DAS 2018 was held in a public-private partnership with the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, the country\u2019s National Academy of Fine and Performing Arts, with support from the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Ministry of Information of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, the National Tourism Board, the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), and in association with the Bangladesh National Museum.\n\n- Jonathan Shaughnessy, Associate Curator, Contemporary Art | Conservateur associ\u00e9, art contemporainNational Gallery of Canada | Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts du Canada (DAS 2020)\n\n\"I feel most fortunate to have had the chance to return to the 2020 Dhaka Art Summit after my initial visit in 2016. The focus on collective practices, \u201cSouth to South\u201d and indigenous networks that guided the programming within the context of Seismic Movements was grounded, insightful, and provided many crucial perspectives on the otherwise often untethered expanses of today\u2019s \u201cglobal\u201d art world. A dynamic gathering of artists, minds, and both general and specialized audiences, the strength of DAS (notwithstanding the clear breadth of research, organization and planning that goes into it) is that it is a platform that knows concertedly from where it speaks, and to what ends it serves, while fostering timely and urgent conversations across local, national, and international lines.\"\n\n- Alain Berset, President of Switzerland (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s intense and you can feel lot of energy - this is somehow logical when you think of Bangladesh as a country with 160 million inhabitants and a very young population - you can actually feel the energy in the exhibition.\u201d\n\n- Elisabeth van Odijk, Director, Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten, Amsterdam (the Netherlands) (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cVisiting Dhaka Art Summit 2018 was an interesting and challenging experience. A great opportunity to get more insight in contemporary art from e.g. Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, in the recent \u2018art history\u2019 of South Asia and in the \u2018cultural\u2019 discourse going on. I am more than impressed by the level and richness delivered by the Art Summit as well as by the open and transparent atmosphere. I learned a lot. The visit broadened my insight into cultural developments in South Asia, and enriched my professional network at different levels. I am looking forward to the next edition!\u201d\n\n- Gregor Muir, Director of Collection, International Art, Tate (DAS 2020)\n\n\"Dhaka Art Summit reveals itself in wonderful myriad ways. That the summit centres on the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy makes perfect sense, allowing for easy manoeuvring between exhibitions, talks, performances and outdoor sculpture. There was much to discover, and a sense of liveliness throughout. Above all, I shall never forget the engagement of the local people whose enthusiasm added to an air of excitement.\"\n\n- Sophie Goltz, Assistant Professor, NTU Centre for Contemporary Art, Singapore (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cDAS 2018 gave us a great opportunity not only to learn about South \/ South East Asian Art but much more to learn how we can engage in our time through art. The manifold conversations, guided tours and lectures challenged and expanded not only the knowledge about art from Asia but also about the Bengal region and its historical and contemporary cultural richness. The educational complexity of DAS gives young people such an important opportunity to learn thinking out of the (academic) box.\u201d\n\n- Glenn Lowry, Director, Museum of Modern Art New York (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cThe Dhaka Art Summit was a revelation. Sharply insightful exhibitions, expansive and generous conversations and panel discussions, and a deeply satisfying experience. I learned a great deal, made unexpected connections, and enjoyed being with so many artists, curators, and scholars whose collective energy animated the Summit.\u201d\n\n- Koyo Kouoh, Founding Artistic Director, RAW Material Company (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cThere is so much to share from this stimulating, inspiring, politically engzged, art historically facinating, sensual, joyful and last but not least simply beautiful show that is the Dhaka Art Summit. Bringing together nine tightly curated exhibitions by a group of the most talented curators practicing today, as well as a though provoking series of screenings, conversations, presentations, performances and symposia; not to mention the incredible education programme with some of the most critically practicing artists, artist\u2019s collectives and thinkers, amazing Diana has completed yet another tour de force for which she can only be highly commended for its curatorial, intellectual, historical and contemporary scop, depth of research and unlimited sense of hospitality.\u201d\n\n- Shuddhabrata Sengupta, Artist, Raqs Media Collective (DAS 2018)\n\n\"The Dhaka Art Summit 2018 has been an intense, exhilarating and thought provoking experience. The curated exhibitions at DAS 2018 offer opportunities to rethink global histories of contemporary art while remaining anchored in a cogently and sharply expressed South Asian context. I had many wonderful experiences and exchanges and was able to get a clear sense of the energy and enthusiasm of the Bangladeshi Contemporary Art scene. The production values of the entire show set a very high standard. DAS is emerging as probably the most significant intersection of creative and discursive energies in the region. With DAS, the artistic and creative communities of Bangladesh stake their claim to being the incubators and custodians of a contemporary cultural sensibility that is truly planetary. This initiative\u2019s continued success is crucial for the health of culture in the entire South Asian region.\"\n\n- Beatrix Ruf, Director, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (DAS 2014)\n\n\"What a memorable experience the Dhaka Art Summit and Samdani Art Foundation organised. An amazing attendance of artists, curators, art professionals and collectors and the challenging and thought provoking panel discussions enabled meetings of people, intensive exchange and an insight not only into how art is integrating in Dhaka and Bangladesh but all of South Asia.\"\n\n- Sebastian Cichocki, Deputy Director and Chief Curator, Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cDAS is not only a show, it is a self-learning apparatus, which changes the patterns of understanding, recognition and global dissemination from the South Asia region. DAS is a polyphony of voices, resonating deep in the contemporary art world but also locally, triggering the imagination of diverse audiences and touching upon the most urgent social, political and economic issues of our times. DAS might be defined also as a free academy, conceptual playground and a carnival. DAS is also a story-teller. One can learn a lot just from listening carefully.\u201d\n\n- Jitish Kallat, artist and curator of Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2014 (DAS 2014)\n\n\"I leave Dhaka, carrying with me a whole lot of generative ideas, great thoughts and memories.I feel what I witnessed is truly historic and will be discussed as a key transformative catalyst for the entire region in the many years to come. Congratulations to Rajeeb and Nadia Samdani and Diana Campbell Betancourt on this whole-hearted visionary effort.\"\n\n- Philippe Pirotte, Dean of the Staedelschule, Frankfurt (DAS 2018)\n\n\u201cFor me the Dhaka Art is a welcome alternative to the biennale circuit. Assuming in a discursively responsible way that such initiatives become more and more condensed events, in a global competition for attention, the Dhaka Art Summit, advances the notion of the \u201csummit\u201d which allows for very different, yet all interesting projects and initiatives, to share a venue, in which conceptual diversity is preferred over the constraints of one curatorial premise. Talks, exhibitions, prizes, documentaries, and even a fair of artist initiatives enrich each other in new surprising ways. Maybe the Dhaka Art Summit is not only an interesting answer to the often fatigue perceived in the biennale circuit but also to the global inflation of art fairs.\u201d\n\n- Jessica Morgan, The Daskalopoulos Curator, International Art, Tate Modern (DAS 2014)\n\n\"I heard over and over that Dhaka Art Summit had managed the complicated and sometimes impossible by bringing together artists, thinkers and curators from South Asia, providing a meeting place and a discursive space which is really to be applauded. The entire event was outstandingly well organised and installed. It was really exceptional to have the live encounter with Nikhil Chopra's performance and without doubt it was the presence of works like his, Shilpa Gupta, Naeem Mohaiemen, Rashid Rana and Mithu Sen, among others, who made work specially for the event, that brought a unique aspect to Dhaka Art Summit.\"\n\n- Maria Lind, Critic and Artistic Director, Gwangju Biennale 2016 (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cI almost gave up reading art writing. I have come to reconsider this through the Summit...\u201d\n\n- Adam Szymczyk, Artistic Director, Documenta 14 (DAS 2014)\n\n\"The Summit was a surprisingly personal, low key and highly focused gathering of many amazing individuals from several countries in South Asia. A variety of experiences brought under one roof was what I really appreciated as it exceeded the usual monoforms of a \"biennial\", \"art fair\", \"conference\" etc., offering instead a holistic experience of being with the artists, seeing their work and discussing it on the spot. Unpretentious and intelligently designed in skillful hands of Chief Curator, Diana Campbell, the Summit felt like it was a labour of love and not a dull cultural marketing exercise.\"\n\n- Lucas Huang, The National Gallery of Singapore (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cI thought the Dhaka Art Summit 2016 was a splendid affair of critical clout and great programming. There is literally nothing like it in Asia and I am certain the next one will be an even bigger success.\u201d\n\n- Dayanita Singh, Artist, India (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cI have never experienced something as art focused, open and inclusive as I just did at Dhaka Art Summit. The calibre of the conversations was a rare happening in our region.\u201d\n\n- Stuart Comer, Chief Curator of Media and Performance, Museum of Modern Art, New York (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cThe Dhaka Summit proved to be an invaluable interface with a number of key artists, discourses, and histories that suggest the increasingly urgent voice South Asia has in the current global cultural discourse....We look forward to developing many of these conversations as we deepen our engagement in the region.\u201d\n\n- Bunty Chand, Director of Asia Society, India (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cDhaka Art Summit has set the gold standard for the visual arts in South Asia\u201d\n\n- Frances Morris, Director of Tate Modern, London, UK, On her second trip to Dhaka, Bangladesh (DAS 2016)\n\n\u201cThe Dhaka Summit has rapidly become an important focus for artists from South Asia and beyond and this year is attracting widespread international attention.\u201d\n\n##### THIRD EDITION\n\n### DAS 2016\n\nDAS provokes reflections on transnationalism, selfhood and time with invited artists, curators and thinkers who build exhibitions through commissioned research and experience within the region\u2014without being prescriptive. Neither a biennial, symposium nor festival but somewhere in between, the unique format of the Summit transforms the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy into a generative space to reconsider the past and future of art and exchange within South Asia and beyond. DAS 2016 included loans from the Bangladesh National Collection; the Museum Folkwang in Essen; the Pinault Collection and many public and private South Asian collections as well as partnerships with institutions such as the Centre Pompidou; Asia Art Archive and Harvard South Asia Institute, DAS considers South Asia from the view of doing and becoming rather than cartography, occupying the triplet planes of imagination, will and circumstance.\n\n##### SECOND EDITION\n\n### DAS 2014\n\nThe 2nd edition of the Dhaka Art Summit unfolded from February 7 to 9, 2014 at the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. Marking a strategic shift, the Summit decided to concentrate its focus on South Asia starting from this edition. DAS 2014 showcased a diverse array of programs, including five curatorial exhibitions by both international and Bangladeshi curators, along with 14 solo art projects curated by Diana Campbell Betancourt, the Artistic Director of the Samdani Foundation. These projects celebrated artists from across South Asia. The summit encompassed a citywide public art initiative, performances, the screening of experimental films, speaker panels, and the active participation of 15 Bangladeshi and 17 South Asia-focused galleries.\n\n##### FIRST EDITION\n\n### DAS 2012\n\nThe 1st edition of the Summit was held in collaboration with Shilpakala Academy and Bangladesh National Museum and showcased the works of 249 artists and 19 galleries. The 1st edition of the Summit focused only on the local artists and galleries. The Summit was visited by over 40,000 visitors The Summit also organised talks.\n\nFollowing the fifth edition subtitled Seismic Movements which welcomed nearly 500,000 visitors in nine days in February 2020, its sixth edition is the first edition with a Bangla subtitle; \u09ac\u09a8\u09cd\u09af\u09be\/Bonna.\n\n\nDAS 2023 considers the ways in which we inherit and form vocabularies to understand the world around us, and the mistranslation that can ensue when we try to apply these vocabularies to unfamiliar contexts; the same word can migrate from positive to negative connotations and back depending on how and where it travels. Weather and water as shapers of history and culture as well as being metaphors for life in general are viewed in an embodied way through the lens of those who live in Bangladesh, next to the sea and rivers, underneath the storm systems, feeling the wind and rain.\n\n# Open Result 1\n#### Adam Broomberg and Rafael Gonzalez\n\nAdam Broomberg is an artist and educator based in Berlin.

He returns to action looking to extend his current winning streak to four, and his preparation so far has been flawless.\n\n\u201cThe Bandit\u201d maintains he is in optimal health, and that the significance of facing a living MMA legend in his final professional bout has added extra motivation for him to deliver a career-defining performance.\n\nThe 34-year old shared:\n\n\u201cFor this fight, everything has been going to plan. Weight, training, eating, and mental. I would say my condition is almost complete. I cannot wait, and I\u2019m honored to be part of this important fight that will be Aung La N Sang\u2019s retirement fight.\u201d\n\n\nBeing \u201cThe Burmese Python\u2019s\u201d final dance partner represents a unique opportunity to share the ring with one of MMA\u2019s most accomplished competitors. Kadestam is honored to help provide a fitting send-off for not just any opponent, but for someone he considers a friend.\n\nKadestam and Aung La N Sang have been friends since the time they reigned as ONE World Champions. Over the years, they have developed a mutual respect and friendship that transcends the four corners of the ring.\n\nThat being said, the Legacy Gym and Allstars Training Center affiliate understands that when the opening bell sounds, personal relationships must take a backseat to professional obligations.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cWe have been friends for quite a while now. But I\u2019m a big fan of him, too. I think he\u2019s a great fighter, and he\u2019s done it all. Whether he is my opponent or not, respect goes beyond the stage. His achievements are up there, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited for this fight against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he is happy to be facing someone like me. Two good fighters, two friends, one winner. Especially with us being friends, I\u2019m sure the fans are gonna enjoy this one.\u201d\n\n\nThough Kadestam holds the utmost respect for the Kill Cliff FC representative, the Swedish bulldozer is determined to mark his return to the world\u2019s largest martial arts organization with authority. He\u2019s out to spoil what many expect to be a celebratory farewell for the Myanmar legend at ONE Fight Night 36.\n\n\u201cThe Bandit\u201d has stopped all of his opponents under the ONE banner, which serves as proof of his sublime finishing ability on the global stage. This move up to middleweight should enhance his already formidable striking power.\n\nWhile the respect between competitors will certainly be a major theme heading into this matchup, the former welterweight king says he will not let that interfere with how he plans to send Aung La N Sang off into retirement:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be sticking to [my knockout power] in this fight against Aung La. It should be better. I\u2019ve been waiting to be back in action, so I\u2019m ready to show my strengthened striking in this fight.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m always aiming for that knockout, but we will see what happens. But the goal is the knockout.\u201d\n\n\n## Kadestam Won\u2019t Underestimate Aung La N Sang\n\nWhile Zebaztian Kadestam is confident in his ability to deliver another highlight-reel finish, the former ONE Welterweight MMA World Champion harbors no illusions about the tremendous challenge that awaits him against Aung La N Sang.\n\nThe Swedish slugger fully expects the Myanmar legend to do everything in his power to write a storybook ending to his iconic career.\n\nKadestam noted:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s coming in well prepared, in excellent condition, and I know he doesn\u2019t want to lose his last fight, so I\u2019m prepared. He\u2019s not some new guy getting used to the fight scene. Again, he has experience, so I think he\u2019d be dangerous.\u201d\n\n\nAbove all, he knows \u201cThe Burmese Python\u201d \u2013 a man with 15 knockout victories on his resume \u2013 packs significant knockout power in his fists. That makes this showdown likely to wind up being an explosive encounter from round one.\n\nGiven that every exchange will carry the potential for the fight\u2019s abrupt end, the margin for error is razor-thin. The Legacy Gym and Allstars Training Center fighter expects an all-out war at ONE Fight Night 36 on Friday, October 3:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got good hands, a lot of knockout power for sure. But, I believe I do, too. When two knockout artists face one another, it means it will be a great fight. I\u2019m sure of it. It\u2019s gonna be a great and explosive fight. Let\u2019s put on a show for the fans.\u201d\n\n# Open Result 1\n# Brian Kernighan\n\n\nBrian Kernighan | |\n|---|---|\n| Born | Brian Wilson Kernighan 30 January 1942 [2][3] |\n| Citizenship | Canada |\n| Alma mater | University of Toronto (BASc) Princeton University (PhD) |\n| Known for | |\nScientific career | |\n| Fields | Computer science |\n| Institutions | Princeton University |\n| Thesis | Some Graph Partitioning Problems Related to Program Segmentation (1969) |\n| Doctoral advisor | Peter Weiner[1] |\n| Website | www |\n\n**Brian Wilson Kernighan** (\/\u02c8k\u025c\u02d0rn\u026ah\u00e6n\/;[5][6] born 30 January 1942)[2] is a Canadian computer scientist.\nHe worked at Bell Labs and contributed to the development of Unix alongside Unix creators Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. Kernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the C programming language (*The C Programming Language*) with Dennis Ritchie. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the C language (\"it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's work\").[7]\n\nKernighan authored many Unix programs, including ditroff. He is coauthor of the AWK and AMPL programming languages. The \"K\" of K&R C and of AWK both stand for \"Kernighan\".\n\nIn collaboration with Shen Lin he devised well-known heuristics for two NP-complete optimization problems: graph partitioning and the travelling salesman problem. In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the Kernighan\u2013Lin algorithm, while the latter is known as the Lin\u2013Kernighan heuristic.\n\nKernighan has been a professor of computer science at Princeton University since 2000 and is the director of undergraduate studies in the department of computer science.[8][9][10] In 2015, he co-authored the book *The Go Programming Language*.\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]Kernighan was born in Toronto. He attended the University of Toronto between 1960 and 1964, earning his bachelor's degree in engineering physics.[7] He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Princeton University in 1969, completing a doctoral dissertation titled \"Some graph partitioning problems related to program segmentation\" under the supervision of Peter G. Weiner.[11][12]\n\n## Career and research\n\n[edit]Kernighan has held a professorship in the department of computer science at Princeton since 2000.[13] Each fall he teaches a course called \"Computers in Our World\", which introduces the fundamentals of computing to non-majors.[14][15]\n\nKernighan was the software editor for Prentice Hall International. His \"Software Tools\" series spread the essence of \"C\/Unix thinking\" with makeovers for BASIC[ citation needed], FORTRAN, and Pascal, and most notably his \"Ratfor\" (rational FORTRAN) was put in the public domain.\n\nHe has said that if stranded on an island with only one programming language it would have to be C.[16]\n\nKernighan coined the term \"Unix\" and helped popularize Thompson's Unix philosophy.[17] Kernighan is also known for coining the expression \"What You See Is All You Get\" (WYSIAYG), which is a sarcastic variant of the original \"What You See Is What You Get\" (WYSIWYG).[18] Kernighan's term is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a document that could be useful in other contexts.\n\nIn 1972, Kernighan described memory management in strings using \"hello\" and \"world\", in the B programming language,[19] which became the iconic example we know today. Kernighan's original 1978 implementation of hello, world! was sold at The Algorithm Auction, the world's first auction of computer algorithms.[20]\n\nIn 1996, Kernighan taught CS50 which is the Harvard University introductory course in computer science. Kernighan was an influence on David J. Malan who subsequently taught the course and scaled it up to run at multiple universities and in multiple digital formats.[21]\n\nKernighan was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2002 for contributions to software and to programming languages. He was also elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2019.[22][23]\n\nIn 2022, Kernighan stated that he was actively working on improvements to the AWK programming language, which he took part in creating in 1977.[24]\n\n### Books and reports\n\n[edit]*The Elements of Programming Style*, with P.

He first served as Chairman of the State Administration Council and as well as the 12th prime minister from 2021 to 2025, and then as the member of the National Defence and Security Council exercising presidential duties since 2024 and as Chairman of the State Security and Peace Commission since 2025.\n\nBorn in Minbu, Min Aung Hlaing studied law at the Rangoon Arts and Science University before joining the military. Rising through its ranks, he became a senior general by 2013.[7] During the period of civilian rule from 2011 to 2021, he work to ensure the military's continued role in politics and forestalled the peace process with ethnic armed groups. A United Nations fact-finding mission found he deliberately perpetrated the Rohingya genocide. He maintained an adversarial relationship with democratically-elected State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, though she defended him against genocide charges.[8]\n\nMin Aung Hlaing baselessly claimed widespread voting irregularities and electoral fraud in the 2020 Myanmar general election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide re-election. He then seized power from her in the 2021 coup.[9][10][11] He had been expected to run for President of Myanmar had the military proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), won enough seats in parliament to elect him, and would have been required to retire as Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services due to a statutory age limit.[12] With the outbreak of mass protests against his rule, Min Aung Hlaing ordered a clampdown and suppression of demonstrations,[13] sparking an ongoing civil war.[14]\n\nMin Aung Hlaing's forces have employed scorched earth tactics in the civil war, including airstrikes on civilians.[15][16] He has ordered the execution of prominent pro-democracy activists, the first use of the death penalty in decades.[17][18] In February 2024, he activated Myanmar's People's Military Service Conscription Law to draft 60,000 young people into the Tatmadaw.[19] In foreign policy, he has resisted influence from Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and relied on greater cooperation with Russia, China, and India.[20][21] In response to his human rights abuses and corruption, Min Aung Hlaing and his government have been subjected to an extensive series of international sanctions, returning Myanmar to its former status as a pariah state. The Economist Intelligence Unit's 2022 *Democracy Index* rated Myanmar under Min Aung Hlaing as the second-most authoritarian regime in the world, with only Afghanistan rated less democratic.[22]\n\n## Early life and education\n\nMin Aung Hlaing was born on 3 July 1956 in Minbu, Magway Region, Burma (now Myanmar), to Khin Hlaing and Hla Mu, as the fourth of five children.[23] His parents were teachers from Dawei, in Tanintharyi Region.[24] His family moved to Mandalay as duty when he was 5 years old. His father, Khin Hlaing, was an artist.[25]\n\nMin Aung Hlaing passed his matriculation exam in 1972 at Basic Education High School No. 1 Latha (BEHS 1 Latha) of Rangoon (now Yangon).[26][27] He attended and studied law at the Rangoon Arts and Science University from 1973 to 1974. On his third attempt, he was admitted to the Defence Services Academy in 1974 as part of the 19th Intake, and he graduated in 1977.[28][29] According to classmates, Min Aung Hlaing was taciturn, and an unremarkable cadet.[30] He was reportedly shunned by classmates because of his reserved personality.[26]\n\n## Military service\n\nFollowing graduation from the Defence Services Academy (DSA) in 1977 with the 19th intake, Min Aung Hlaing went on to serve in different command positions, rising slowly through the ranks.[30] He was assigned to the No. (313) Light Infantry Battalion (Hmawbi), then known as the No. (1) Shan Rifle Battalion, under the command of the No. (77) Light Infantry Division. Former president of Myanmar Thein Sein was also assigned to this battalion, and former Director of Defence Service Intelligence General Khin Nyunt served as a company commander in the same unit.[31]\n\nEarly in his career, military colleagues gave him a nickname referring to cat feces, \"something deposited quietly but leaving a powerful stink.\"[32]\n\nIn 1979, during an offensive known as Operation Min Yan Aung (Victorious King) against the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) in what is now Matman Township in Wa State, east of the Thanlwin River, Min Aung Hlaing served as an Intelligence Officer (IO) ranked as a Lieutenant (2 stars) at 23 years old.\n\nIn 1989, as a Captain (3 stars), Min Aung Hlaing took part in the Battle of Wan Kha Thit, better known as the Battle of Kawmoora. This battle was a clash between army troops controlled by then Commander-in-chief Senior General Than Shwe and the Karen National Union (KNU). Due to the base's difficult position to attack, the Myanmar military repeatedly assaulted it throughout 1989 but failed to seize it, halting operations in 1990 after suffering hundreds of casualties.\n\nTo ward off harm from enemy shells and bullets, Min Aung Hlaing carried a Buddha statue in his bag of topographic maps worn across his chest. Despite making speeches for officer cadets to be brave soldiers like him, he never led any missions against KNU troops.[33]\n\nMin Aung Hlaing served as a Battalion Officer Commanding, ranked as a Major, at the No. (369) Light Infantry Battalion (Homalin) under the Regional Operations Command (Kalay) of the Northwestern Regional Military Command. During his service, he imprisoned the pregnant wife of a sergeant who was deemed to have deserted the battalion. At that time, the General Officer Commanding of the Regional Operations Command (Kalay) was Brigadier General Thura Aung Ko, and the Tactical Operation Command Officer Commanding was Colonel Kyaw Thu. During an inspection, Colonel Kyaw Thu discovered the woman locked in the battalion prison and questioned Major Min Aung Hlaing why he did such a thing. Min Aung Hlaing explained that she was imprisoned because her husband had deserted. Colonel Kyaw Thu responded, \"Do not do such a disgraceful thing. It's nonsense to arrest the wife just because her husband deserted. Release her now.\"[34] The woman was only released thanks to Colonel Kyaw Thu's intervention.\n\nMin Aung Hlaing served as the 19th rector of the Defence Services Academy (DSA), having graduated from its 19th intake. During his tenure, he was involved in an incident with Nay Shwe Thway Aung (also known as Phoe La Pyae), the 8-year-old grandson of Senior General Than Shwe. Nay Shwe Thway Aung visited the academy with a colonel acting as his personal bodyguard. At Nay Shwe Thway Aung's request, Min Aung Hlaing organized a football match, dismissing the Officer Cadets from their Physical Training (PT) session. Throughout the match, Min Aung Hlaing frequently inquired about Nay Shwe Thway Aung's well-being, contrasting with his usually strict demeanor towards the officers on the field.[35]\n\nMin Aung Hlaing was also known for his strict enforcement of military regulations. He reported several coaches and cadets to the Military Appointment General (MAG) for minor infractions, such as not wearing helmets while riding motorcycles. These actions were perceived as efforts to secure his promotion to Major General and to obtain a position as a General Officer Commanding as a Regional Military Command. As a result of his reports, the officers and cadets faced significant career setbacks, with many unable to advance beyond the rank of Captain.[35]\n\nAs he rose through the ranks, Min Aung Hlaing earned a reputation as a hardliner.[26] His military work earned him the favour of Senior General Than Shwe.[36] Min Aung Hlaing is characterized as having a \"big man\" management style not conducive to collaboration or listening.[36]\n\nIn 2002, he was promoted to commander of the Triangle Regional Military Command in eastern Shan State and was a central figure in negotiations with two rebel groups, the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA).[26] Min Aung Hlaing was reportedly close with former Thai prime minister and a General Prem Tinsulanonda, considering Prem a father figure.[37][38]\n\nMin Aung Hlaing supported the military crackdown of the Saffron Revolution in 2008.[26] He rose to prominence in 2009 after leading an offensive against the insurgent Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) in Kokang.[39] In June 2010, Min Aung Hlaing replaced General Shwe Mann as Joint Chief of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.[26]\n\n### Corruption\n\nMin Aung Hlaing has been the subject of controversy for his family's extensive business assets and potential conflicts of interest.[40] He is a major shareholder in the army-owned Myanma Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL). During the 2010\u201311 fiscal year, he had owned 5,000 shares and received an annual dividend of $250,000 (~$349,994 in 2024).[41] He sits on MEHL's Patron Group, which runs the conglomerate.[42]\n\nMin Aung Hlaing's son, Aung Pyae Sone, owns a number of companies, including Sky One Construction Company and Aung Myint Mo Min Insurance Company.[43] He also has a majority stake in Mytel, a national telecoms carrier.[43] In 2013, his son Aung Pyae Sone won a no-bid government permit well below market rates, for a 30-year lease on land at the Yangon People's Square and Park for a high-end restaurant and art gallery, following his father's promotion to Commander-in-Chief.[44] Aung Pyae Sone also runs *A&M Mahar*, which offers Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals and customs clearance services for drugs and medical devices.[45] Myanmar's customs department is led by Kyaw Htin, a former MEHL director.[45]\n\nHis daughter Khin Thiri Thet Mon founded a major film studio, 7th Sense Creation, in 2017.[46] That same year, his daughter-in-law, Myo Yadanar Htaik, founded another entertainment company, Stellar Seven Entertainment.[46] The US Embassy in Yangon came under media scrutiny in December 2020, for collaborating with 7th Sense Creation, because Min Aung Hlaing is technically subject to US economic sanctions.[47]\n\n## Commander-in-chief\n\n### 2011\u20132015: Union Solidarity and Development Party rule\n\nIn the lead-up to 2011, the military began embarking on a series of political reforms to transition Myanmar to a quasi-democracy. The ruling junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDP), engineered its formal departure from power, after holding the 2010 Myanmar general election, which was won by the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), the military's proxy party. On 30 March 2011, outgoing head of state, Senior General Than Shwe, then the incumbent Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar's Armed Forces, appointed Min Aung Hlaing as his successor, ahead of more senior officers.[48][49] Min Aung Hlaing's appointment coincided with the USDP's rise to power, during which he oversaw a series of military reforms, and supported efforts by the USDP-led government to strike peace deals with ethnic armed organisations.[48]\n\nNot long after becoming Commander-in-chief, he removed the Adjutant General, Lieutenant General Kyaw Phyo and General Officer Commanding of Central Regional Military Command Major General Tin Ngwe and built the atmosphere of fear among the top brass.[35]\n\nIn November 2011, according to *The Irrawaddy*, it was \"widely believed\" that following Min Aung Hlaing's meetings with Chinese military officials that month and his leadership in creating a bilateral agreement on defense cooperation with the Chinese, he had also held talks with Chinese vice-president Xi Jinping regarding cooperation from China with respect to the Kachin Conflict.[39]\n\nOn 27 March 2012, during a speech in Naypyidaw, Min Aung Hlaing defended the military's continued role in national politics.[39][50] On 3 April 2012, the Government of Myanmar announced that Min Aung Hlaing had been promoted to vice-senior general (four-star general), the second highest rank in the Myanmar Armed Forces.[39] He was promoted to the rank of senior general (five-star general), the highest rank in the Myanmar's Armed Forces in March 2013.[7]\n\nIn 2014, as Min Aung Hlaing approached the age of 60, which is the mandatory age of retirement for military officers, the Armed Forces' Department of Defence Council issued a directive, enabling Min Aung Hlaing to extend his mandatory retirement age to 65, in 2021.[51]\n\nIn August 2015, the USDP fractured, and President Thein Sein purged the faction led by Shwe Mann, a former general and Speaker of the Pyithu Hluttaw.[48] Min Aung Hlaing oversaw a direct military intervention to oust Shwe Mann from power, indicating the military's desire to continue furthering its agenda through USDP.[52] Shwe Mann had advocated for legislation and constitutional amendments that would have decreased the military's influence, against the interests of the military and USDP.[52]\n\n### 2016\u20132020: Transition to National League for Democracy rule\n\nThe 2015 Myanmar general election saw the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, win in a landslide. With the transition from an USDP to NLD-led government, Min Aung Hlaing shifted his priorities to recovering state power for the military establishment.[48] His intransigence and refusal to cooperate with the civilian-led government undermined progress toward Myanmar's peace process.[48] As the NLD assumed power, Min Aung Hlaing began intensifying an ongoing military crackdown on the Rohingya, beginning in October 2016.[53][54] At the Union Peace Conference - 21st Century Panglong in August 2020, he warned the NLD against scapegoating the military for its role in the ongoing ethnic conflicts.[55]\n\nMin Aung Hlaing also began to signal his interest in civilian politics.[48] He began assuming a more statesman-like persona, and became increasingly assertive about the military's role.[55][32] In the lead-up to the 2020 Myanmar general election, he worked with the USDP to position himself as the next President.[55] Throughout 2019, Min Aung Hlaing made several public appearances dubbed a \"charm offensive,\" at several religious sites and charity functions,[56] raising speculation about his political ambitions.[57][51] To cultivate his public persona, he began two Facebook pages that commanded a combined following of 4.1 million followers.[58][59] In January 2020, Min Aung Hlaing met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Nay Pyi Taw. Xi promoted the practical cooperation under the framework of the One Belt One Road to achieve results at an early date and benefit Myanmar's people.[60] In May 2020, Min Aung Hlaing reshuffled senior military ranks, promoting a new generation of officers loyal to him, including Kyaw Swar Lin, who became the military's youngest lieutenant general.[61]\n\nWar with the Arakan Army intensified during this period, and the military was accused of targeting Arakanese civilians and their properties. On 17 March 2019, Kyaw Zaw Oo, an Arakanese MP, published a bilingual open letter to Min Aung Hlaing about the many human rights violations of the Tatmadaw in Rakhine State that harmed the lives and property of civilians and damaged buildings of cultural heritage.[62][63]\n\nIn February 2020, Min Aung Hlaing, his wife Kyu Kyu Hla and with his close astrologer Vasipake Sayadaw placed the \"Hti\" umbrella atop Bagan's most powerful ancient Htilominlo Temple. The meaning of the temple name is \"need the royal umbrella, need the King\". He was following in the footsteps of some of Myanmar's most powerful political figures including his predecessor, Senior General Than Shwe. Many people believed that the ceremony was a yadaya and seeking divine blessings for his glory.[64]\n\nIn November 2020, Min Aung Hlaing made a series of public comments questioning the legitimacy of the upcoming 2020 election, in potential violation of the Civil Services Personnel Law.[65] On 5 November, the Tatmadaw declared that Min Aung Hlaing's rank is equivalent to Vice President of Myanmar.[66] After casting his ballot in the 2020 election, Min Aung Hlaing vowed to accept the election results.[67] The 2020 election saw NLD win in a larger landslide than in 2015, forestalling Min Aung Hlaing's political ambitions. In response, the military began intensifying allegations of electoral fraud and irregularities, submitting formal complaints to the Union Election Commission (UEC).[68]\n\n## 2021 Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat\n\nThis article needs to be updated. (November 2025) |\n\nOn 27 January 2021, Min Aung Hlaing publicly remarked that he would not rule out a coup d'\u00e9tat and abolition of the constitution, if allegations of voter fraud during last year's election were not adequately addressed. These comments sparked concern about another potential coup.[69] The following day, the UEC issued a statement rejecting claims of electoral fraud, citing the lack of evidence submitted to substantiate these claims.[70] On 29 January, the military issued clarifying statements pledging to protect and abide by the constitution and applicable laws.[71]\n\nOn 1 February 2021, Min Aung Hlaing detained elected leaders including President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and declared himself as Commander-in-chief of Myanmar, one day before democratically elected members of parliament were scheduled to be sworn in as members of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (Assembly of the Union). The following day, he established the State Administration Council (SAC) as the country's interim ruling body.[72][73]\n\nOn 22 May 2021, Min Aung Hlaing gave his first interview since the coup to Hong Kong-based Chinese language Phoenix Television. During the interview, he referred to deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi and he said that she \"is in good health. She is at her home and healthy. She is going to face trial at the court in a few days.\"[74] On the same day, *Myanmar Now* reported that shortly after the coup, Min Aung Hlaing appointed himself indefinitely as the commander-in-chief and therefore the *de facto* leader of Myanmar.[75]\n\nSix months after the coup, on 1 August 2021, Min Aung Hlaing formed a caretaker government and established himself as the country'\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step-by-step reasoning with sources:\n\n1.

These cells have a myofibroblastic phenotype with the ability to proliferate and synthesize large quantities of extracellular matrix components. A number of factors have been proposed to initiate and perpetuate the fibrogenic process in stellate cells, including inflammatory cytokines, alterations in the extracellular matrix, growth factors, and oxidative stress. Some recent research has focused on the intracellular signaling pathways that are stimulated by these factors in stellate cells, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, focal adhesion kinase, and protein kinase C. This paper will summarize the experimental evidence that implicates these pathways in stellate cell activation, focusing on the effects of exposure to platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and fibronectin.

Its association with beta2M was previously shown to be necessary for its stability, normal intracellular processing, and cell surface expression in transfected COS cells. Here we use stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing both HFE and beta2M or HFE alone to study the effects of beta2M on the stability and maturation of the HFE protein and on the role of HFE in transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)-mediated iron uptake. In agreement with prior studies on other cell lines, we found that overexpression of HFE, without overexpressing beta2M, resulted in a decrease in TfR1dependent iron uptake and in lower iron levels in the cells, as evidenced by ferritin and TfR1 levels measured at steady state. However, overexpression of both HFE and beta2M had the reverse effect and resulted in an increase in TfR1-dependent iron uptake and increased iron levels in the cells. The HFE-beta2M complex did not affect the affinity of TfR1 for transferrin or the internalization rate of transferrin-bound TfR1. Instead, HFE-beta2M enhanced the rate of recycling of TfR1 and resulted in an increase in the steady-state level of TfR1 at the cell surface of stably transfected cells. We propose that Chinese hamster ovary cells provide a model to explain the effect of the HFE-beta2M complex in duodenal crypt cells, where the HFE-beta2M complex appears to facilitate the uptake of transferrin-bound iron to sense the level of body iron stores. Impairment of this process in duodenal crypt cells leads them to be iron poor and to signal the differentiating enterocytes to take up iron excessively after they mature into villus cells in the duodenum of hereditary hemochromatosis patients.\n\n## Figures\n\n## References\n\n-\n- Cartwright G E, Edwards C Q, Kravitz K, Skolnick M, Amos D B, Johnson A, Buskjaer L.

The story of patients dying unnecessarily in this way had a powerful effect on the public. Numerous (often sensationalistic) accounts in the lay media across the country speculated on possible causes of the errors, publicly chastised the pharmacy technicians and other professionals involved, and called into question the safety of all of Canada's healthcare institutions. As a result of these events, an independent inquiry of the incident was conducted, a new patient safety position was created for the region,1 a review of best practices was commissioned, and many changes were made to ensure \u201cthis would never happen again.\u201d Often it is the public response to a story about an adverse event or medical error that drives changes in practice, rather than careful attention to the available evidence.2\n\nSince the publication of the Institute of Medicine's report, *To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health Care System*,3 the safety of medications, and of patients in general, has caught the attention of the general public and hospital healthcare practitioners. This report identified medication errors as the single largest cause of medical errors in hospitals, accounting for some 7000 deaths each year in the United States. Another report estimated that more than one million medication errors occur every year in US hospitals,4 and about 5% of all admissions to hospital are related to adverse drug events.5 Since the report, most safety research has focused on measuring the incidence of adverse events, including medication errors, rather than evaluating the effectiveness of current or proposed safety practices relating to medication and patients. The use of potassium supplements and safe handling of potassium are examples of the kind of practice affecting the safety of patients that is common and ought to be improved through the rigorous application of evidence based practices. Surveillance systems in US hospitals report that potassium chloride concentrate is the drug most often implicated in fatal incidents.6\n\nWe conducted a qualitative systematic review of the literature evaluating best practices for handling products containing potassium in hospital settings, at all stages of the process by which medications are used, to help frontline personnel improve patients' safety in the hospital setting. We identified and summarised the evidence supporting practices for handling products containing potassium safely, to provide policy makers and healthcare practitioners with guidance to facilitate best practice.\n\n**Summary points**\n\nRecommendations for improved patients' safety, specifically the safety of products containing potassium, are often based on practice guidelines and untested recommendations widely endorsed by various experts or organisations\n\nValid and empirical evidence to support or discourage implementation of even the most widely identified potassium safety practices is completely lacking\n\nResearch aimed at evaluating healthcare systems as a whole, accompanied by implementation of effective evidence based medication safety practices, is essential and urgently needed\n\n## Methods\n\nWe searched the reference lists of major reviews already completed on the safety of medication and known bibliographies relevant to patients' safety and medication error. We supplemented this by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2nd quarter 2004), Medline (1966 to May 2004, week 4), Embase (1988 to 2004, week 22), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to May 2004). We used broad search terms to ensure that we identified all studies related to the safe use of potassium. Searches were not limited to specific study designs, to allow us to identify research encompassing all levels of evidence. We examined the reference lists of all related articles for relevant studies. We considered only English language reports.\n\nWe also examined sources of relevant grey literature for information about medication safety. We searched the internet to identify pertinent government agencies and non-governmental organisations, special interest groups or lobby groups, accreditation agencies, key informants, and other websites of interest. We contacted key informants from these organisations.\n\nIn recognition of the current early state of literature about the safety of patients and medications and the importance of practices that are relevant to existing systems, we systematically searched for publications that would provide a comprehensive set of best practice information across a continuum of evidence. We did not include reports that were simply descriptive in nature or that lacked any supporting evidence. We examined the entire medication process, from production in the pharmaceutical companies to direct administration of drugs to patients, to identify potential interventions. Although each stage of the medication process offers opportunities for improving patients' safety, the primary focus of this review is on those interventions that are directly applicable to the administration of potassium.\n\n## Results\n\nOf the 2533 citations identified in the literature search, we retrieved 238 that seemed potentially relevant. We excluded all from this analysis because they were case reports, anecdotal papers, or opinion papers. We did not find a single study that evaluated the effectiveness of any of the practices routinely recommended for the safe use of products containing potassium, nor for the use of analysis of healthcare systems, including organisational culture and structure, in medication safety. The literature discussing the safety of potassium consists largely of case reports of errors resulting from the improper use of potassium, and expert recommendations for preventing these case specific errors. These recommendations are not based on evidence on the relative effectiveness of various corrective practice options but rather on expert consensus, the experience of various hospitals that have implemented specific practices, and practices endorsed by well respected patient safety and medication safety organisations. These organisations, found largely in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, provide support, expertise, and resources for improving the safety of medications. Box 1 shows the spectrum of recommendations for potassium safety that we found, not as an endorsement of any particular practice, but to illustrate the broad scope of practices commonly implemented\u2014practices that, as far as we were able to ascertain, have no evidence basis indicating they might actually reduce harm.\n\n### Removing potassium chloride from clinical areas\n\nThe single most often suggested strategy for reducing medication errors involving potassium chloride is to remove all stocks of concentrated potassium chloride from clinical areas. Rather than being based on specific research studies that have determined the efficacy of this, and other, recommendations, this suggestion is based on forcing function concepts (whereby the system is designed to force healthcare professionals to act in a certain way, preventing adverse events) drawn from research literature into human factors. Although safety organisations strongly recommend removing concentrated potassium chloride from wards, many hospitals continue to stock this medication in clinical areas. A 1997 survey of US hospitals determined that concentrated potassium chloride was kept in 59.4% of all emergency departments and 71.9% of all intensive care units.6 The same survey indicated that the primary reason that hospital staff found it necessary to maintain stocks of potassium chloride in these departments was because patients requiring this medication often need it very quickly, and any delay in administering it could severely compromise patients' care. In addition, many hospital pharmacies have limited hours of operation, necessitating storage of potassium chloride in clinical areas. For this reason, several agencies specify that stocks of potassium chloride can remain in critical care areas, but care must be taken to avoid transferring ampoules between clinical areas.6,7 In addition, it is often recommended that when potassium chloride must be kept on the wards it should be kept in a locked cupboard, separate from all other solutions.6-8 Proper protocols should be developed to monitor the removal, use, and restocking of potassium chloride, including the checking of drug use against prescription orders, and to reduce unauthorised transfer of drugs across clinical departments.9\n\n### Packaging and preparation of potassium chloride\n\nMistakes are often made during the preparation of dilute solutions containing potassium. Similar packaging to other solutions, storage of potassium chloride in close proximity to other solutions, and a lack of effective independent double checking have all contributed to medication errors involving potassium chloride.10 For this reason, commercially prepared dilute solutions are often recommended.6,8,11 Some literature on safe medication recommends that healthcare providers should prescribe potassium solutions in standardised concentrations, available as commercially prepared products.7 However, when premixed solutions are not feasible, required dilutions should be made only in the pharmacy and never in clinical areas.12 It is recommended that in the pharmacy, efforts should be made to ensure potassium products are easily distinguishable from similar products.8,9,13 This can be accomplished by having a separate storage area for products containing concentrated potassium and adding auxiliary fluorescent warning labels to both concentrated potassium chloride and diluted intravenous solutions.13 In addition, some hospitals purchase concentrated potassium solutions from a different vendor from the one they use to supply dilute solutions to avoid errors caused by packaging similarities.14\n\n**Box 1: Recommendations for safe handling of potassium products**\n\n**Drug storage**\n\nRemove concentrated potassium chloride from clinical areas\n\nStore potassium products in locked cupboards in clinical areas\n\nEliminate the transfer of potassium products between wards and other clinical areas\n\n\n**Drug preparation**\n\nHave pre-prepared intravenous infusion available that contains potassium\n\nPrepare needed infusions in the pharmacy\n\n\n**Drug packaging**\n\n\u2022 Ensure ampoules of potassium chloride are distinguishable from other injectable preparations\n\n**Prescribing**\n\nPrescribe potassium chloride in concentrations available as ready made infusions\n\nAvoid \u201cincomplete\u201d and illegible prescribing\n\nPrescribe oral potassium chloride to treat hypokalaemia when clinically feasible\n\n\n**Drug administration**\n\nDevelop clear therapeutic guidelines defining the maximum concentration of potassium in an intravenous solution\n\nDevelop clear therapeutic guidelines defining infusion rates for the administration of intravenous potassium\n\nInstitute a double check policy\n\nEnsure safe use of infusion pumps\n\n\n**Pharmaceutical industry standards**\n\n\u2022 Encourage distinct, standardised labelling and packaging as an industry standard\n\n### Development of guidelines for appropriate administration\n\nMany people recommend that therapeutic guidelines be developed for the administration of potassium chloride13 and once developed, continuous training of healthcare staff should be implemented to ensure these guidelines are understood and implemented. The Safety and Quality Council of Australia has summarised the recommended components of potassium chloride guidelines (box 2).9\n\nMost medication errors occur at the prescribing and administration level.15,16 For this reason, clear guidelines should be developed to ensure that safe prescribing practices are used for products containing potassium. Common recommendations include ensuring that all prescriptions include instructions for dilution and infusion rates, and avoiding the term \u201cbolus\u201d for intravenous orders.9 In terms of administering products containing potassium, the universal recommendation is to develop double check policies (similar to those used for blood transfusion) for every step in the process of administering medications. For example, it is often suggested that two healthcare providers always check for the correct product, dose, dilution, labelling, route, and rate before administering any medication, to ensure it complies with the therapeutic guidelines.9\n\n**Box 2: Recommendations for guidelines for administration of potassium chloride**\n\nOral potassium should be used to treat hypokalaemia when clinically feasible\n\nPrescribing should be standardised to ensure all intravenous potassium chloride is ordered in millimoles (mmol)\n\nPrescribing should be standardised, and premixed solution should be encouraged\n\nClear definitions should be developed to indicate the maximum concentration of potassium chloride in an intravenous solution\n\nThe maximum hourly rate and daily limits that a patient may receive, in addition to infusion rates and infusion pump requirements, should be specified\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIt is not, perhaps, surprising to find a complete lack of valid evidence to support or discourage implementation of even the most widely recommended, identified practices for administering medication safely, with respect to the safe administration of potassium. However, considerable debate surrounding the current state of the science occurs in the literature on patients' safety and a recurrent theme consistently emerges: what role (if any) does evidence have in medication safety?\n\nIn response to the medical error data published in *To Err is Human*,3 the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned the University of California, San Francisco-Stanford University Evidence-Based Practice Center to produce a report summarising the literature surrounding practices relevant to improving patients' safety. This landmark report, *Making Health Care Safer: A Critical Analysis of Patient Safety Practices,* contains summaries of the evidence supporting 83 safety practices.17 Only six of these practices concern medication safety,18 and none of them deals with practices specifically relating to the safe administration of products containing potassium. This report generated controversy in the literature on patients' safety, largely because most of the practices advocated by leading patient safety agencies were not tackled nor even considered. In addition, this report sparked new interest in the continuing debate surrounding the principles of evidence based medicine and its role in patients' safety.\n\n### Safety practices\n\nMany leading medication safety experts and agencies believe that the safety of medications, indeed of patients in general, is primarily a \u201csystems\u201d issue. Unfortunately, this hypothesis has not been tested rigorously, and it is often claimed that changes to systems are not as easily evaluated as specific, individual practices and technologies. In addition, several practices that are widely endorsed were not mentioned in the report of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality but are nevertheless directly relevant to the safe handling of potassium. These include19:\n\nInstituting pharmacy based intravenous admixture systems\n\nRemoving concentrated potassium chloride vials from areas where patients are being cared for and stocking premixed solutions on wards\n\nDeveloping special procedures for high risk drugs by using a multidisciplinary approach (written guidelines, checklists, preprinted orders, double checks, special packaging, special labelling)\n\nProviding doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and all other clinicians involved in the medication process with education on ordering, dispensing, administering, and monitoring medications\n\nHaving a pharmacist available on call after hours of pharmacy operation.\n\n\nMany of these practices reflect the basic tenets of the systems based approach, such as building in system redundancies (\u201cdouble checks\u201d), reducing options, and standardising or simplifying processes.7\n\nInvestigations of fatalities and injuries caused by the misuse of potassium need to take into account the full range of systems based factors that might affect the safety of medications, including the priority and resources given to patients' safety in general. Furthermore, to reduce the incidence of potassium related (and other medications) errors\u2014many of which are preventable\u2014effectively, hospitals must go beyond investigating individual incidents and focus more on identifying and implementing effective, systems based improvements that are grounded in evidence of reasonable quality.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThis systematic review highlights the lack of strong evidence in support of specific best practice initiatives related to the safe handling of potassium containing products. The quality and quantity of evidence in support of best practices related to other patient safety issues is likely in a similar state. If the aim is to identify and implement the most effective medication safety practices, then systems oriented evaluation research accompanied by implementation of evidence based medication safety practices is essential. The need is especially urgent given our main finding that no valid studies evaluate the effectiveness of any of the practices currently recommended for the safe handling of products containing potassium.\n\n**Additional educational resources**\n\n*Making health care safer: a critical analysis of patient safety practices* (www.ahrq.gov\/clinic\/ptsafety\/)\u2014The report of an evidence based project, funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, that collected and critically reviewed the existing evidence on practices relevant to improving the safety of patients, including medication safety (primarily pertaining to heparin and warfarin)\n\nNational Patient Safety Agency (www.npsa.nhs.uk)\u2014This UK agency aims to foster a culture in which errors in the NHS healthcare system can be investigated and innovative solutions developed.

Here, performing with the Prep Players, he gained his first theatrical experience. At Marquette University, he participated in the Marquette University Players. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1960, he decided to seek a career in theater, starting in New York City in improv with a troupe called The Premise. After compulsory service as a draftee in the United States Army, he worked with an improv troupe in San Francisco known as The Committee, whose members included Rob Reiner, David Ogden Stiers, Howard Hesseman and Hamilton Camp.[4]\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]Bonerz's first network television appearance was in 1965 on *The Addams Family* in the season-two episode \"Morticia, The Writer\".[5] He had several more TV appearances in the late 1960s and also had roles in several films, including *Funnyman* (1967); *What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?* (1969); *Medium Cool* (1969); *Catch-22* (1970), which also included his future co-star Bob Newhart; *Jennifer on My Mind* (1971); and *Fuzz* (1972). In 1971, Bonerz was part of an ensemble cast in the short-lived improvisational television show *Story Theatre*, which also included Alan Alda and Valerie Harper. In 1972, he landed the popular supporting role of Dr. Jerry Robinson, the eccentric orthodontist on *The Bob Newhart Show*, whose most frequent comic foil was Marcia Wallace as Carol, the sharp-tongued receptionist. Bonerz would reprise this role in a cameo appearance in the final, unaired episode of Bob Newhart's third series, *Bob*.[6] He also directed 29 episodes. The show ran for six seasons, with ratings among the top 20 in the first three seasons. Bonerz became the last surviving main cast member upon the death of Bob Newhart in 2024.\n\nHis later acting roles included the TV miniseries *The Bastard* (1978) and as a psychiatrist in the movie *Serial* (1980). In 1979, Bonerz appeared on *Password Plus* as a game show contestant\/celebrity guest star with Marcia Wallace, his costar from *The Bob Newhart Show*. In 1986, Bonerz co-starred with Tuesday Weld and River Phoenix in the television movie *Circle of Violence: A Family Drama*. In 1999, he played Ed. Weinberger in the movie *Man on the Moon*. He voiced Sal in the *Aaahh!!! Real Monsters* episode \"Internal Affairs\". In 2014, he played Doug Demarco in the \"Anniversaries\" episode of *Parks and Recreation*.\n\nBeginning in 1974, Bonerz directed 29 episodes of *The Bob Newhart Show*. Between 1974 and 2011, he directed over 350 episodes of various shows, including series like *Murphy Brown* (93 episodes), *Home Improvement* (29 episodes), *E\/R* (22 episodes), *Friends* (12 episodes), *Joey* (3 episodes), and many others such as *Wings*, *NewsRadio*, *Archie Bunker's Place*, and *ALF*. He also directed films such as *Nobody's Perfekt* (1981) and *Police Academy 6: City Under Siege* (1989).[7]\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]Bonerz married Rosalind DiTrapani in 1963; together they have two sons, Eli and Eric.[8]\n\n## Filmography\n\n[edit]### As actor\n\n[edit]- 1965:\n*The Addams Family*as Mr. Boswell - 1966:\n*Summer Fun*as \"Chips\" - 1967:\n*Hey, Landlord*as Proctor - 1967:\n*Funnyman*as Perry - 1968:\n*That Girl*as Larry Yorkin - 1968\u20131969:\n*The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour*as Various Roles - 1969:\n*Where It's At*as Unknown Role - 1969:\n*Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice?*as Mr. Bentley - 1969:\n*Medium Cool*as Gus - 1969:\n*The Governor & J.J.*as Hubbell - 1970:\n*A Storm in Summer*as Stanley - 1970:\n*Catch-22*as MacWatt - 1970:\n*Hawaii Five-O*as Earl - 1971:\n*U.S.A.*as Unknown Role - 1971:\n*Story Theatre*as Unknown Role - 1971:\n*McMillan and Wife*as George Harvard (ep. \u201cDeath is a Seven Point Favorite\u201d) - 1971:\n*Jennifer of My Mind*as Sergei Wasserman - 1972:\n*Sanford and Son*as Doctor - 1972\u20131978:\n*The Bob Newhart Show*as Dr. Jerry Robinson - 1986:\n*Murder, She Wrote*as Calhoun Fletcher (ep. \u201cThe Perfect Foil\u201d)\n\n### As director\n\n[edit]- 1966:\n*Summer Fun* - 1974:\n*The Mary Tyler Moore Show* - 1974:\n*Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers* - 1974\u20131978:\n*The Bob Newhart Show* - 1975:\n*When Things Were Rotten* - 1976:\n*Good Heavens* - 1976:\n*Father O Father*(TV film) - 1976:\n*The Tony Randall Show* - 1977:\n*Szysznyk* - 1978:\n*Apple Pie* - 1979:\n*McGurk: A Dog's Life* - 1980:\n*Love, Natalie* - 1980:\n*G.I.'s* - 1981:\n*Nobody's Perfekt* - 1982:\n*In Security* - 1982:\n*High Five*(TV short) - 1983:\n*Focus on Fishko*(short) - 1983:\n*Simeon Show* - 1984:\n*Back Together* - 1984:\n*Suzanne Pleshette Is Maggie Briggs* - 1985:\n*The Recovery Room* - 1988:\n*Sharing Richard* - 1989:\n*Police Academy 6: City Under Siege* - 1989:\n*Julie Brown: The Show*(TV short) - 1993:\n*The Elvira Show*(TV short) - 1996\u20131999:\n*Home Improvement* - 2005\u20132006:\n*Joey* - 2005\u20132007:\n*Living with Fran* - 2006:\n*Drive\/II* - 2011:\n*$h*!

Mindaugas faced many challenges during his reign, including fights with enemies and rival tribes. \u2694\ufe0f One major conflict occurred when the Teutonic Knights, a group of Christian warriors, tried to conquer Lithuania. They wanted to spread Christianity but often used violence.\nQ: Who was Mindaugas and why is he important in Lithuanian history?\nA: Mindaugas was a chieftain who was able to unite the tribes and, by converting to Catholicism, receive official recognition as king of Lithuania by Pope Innocent IV. Unfortunately, he was killed, possibly in an assassination, in 1263, and for a time Lithuania reverted to paganism.\nQ: What were Mindaugas' accomplishments?\nA: Mindaugas (died 1263) was a ruler of Lithuania, considered the founder of the Lithuanian state. He was also the first Lithuanian ruler to become a Christian. Mindaugas successfully asserted himself over other leading Lithuanian nobles and tribal chiefs, including his brother and his nephews, in 1236.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_fsjXiDpIf1X9GPzJMkEJIz0b\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mindaugas\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Open Result 0\n# Mindaugas\n\n\n| Mindaugas | |\n|---|---|\n| King of Lithuania | |\n| Reign | 1253\u20131263 |\n| Coronation | 6 July 1253 |\n| Grand Duke of Lithuania | |\n| Reign | 1236\u20131253 |\n| Successor | Treniota |\n| Born | c. 1203 |\n| Died | 12 September 1263 |\n| Spouse | Sister of Morta Morta |\nIssueat least 3 more... | Vai\u0161vilkas |\n| House | House of Mindaugas |\n| Religion |\n\n**Mindaugas**[a] (c. 1203 \u2013 12 September 1263) was the first known Grand Duke of Lithuania and the only crowned King of Lithuania.[1][2] Little is known of his origins, early life, or rise to power; he is mentioned in a 1219 treaty as an elder duke, and in 1236 as the leader of all the Lithuanians. The contemporary and modern sources discussing his ascent mention strategic marriages along with banishment or murder of his rivals. He extended his domain into regions southeast of Lithuania proper during the 1230s and 1240s. In 1250 or 1251, during the course of internal power struggles, he was baptised as a Roman Catholic; this action enabled him to establish an alliance with the Livonian Order, a long-standing antagonist of the Lithuanians. By 1245, Mindaugas was already being referred to as \"the highest king\" in certain documents.[3] During the summer of 1253, he was crowned king,[4] ruling between 300,000 and 400,000 subjects, and got nicknamed as *Mindaugas the Sapient* by the Livonians.[5][6]\n\nWhile Mindaugas's ten-year reign as king was marked by many state-building accomplishments, his conflicts with relatives and other dukes continued. The western part of Lithuania \u2013 Samogitia \u2013 strongly resisted the alliance's rule. His gains in the southeast were challenged by the Tatars. He broke peace with the Livonian Order in 1261, possibly renouncing Christianity, and was assassinated in 1263 by his nephew Treniota and another rival, Duke Daumantas of Pskov. His three immediate successors were assassinated as well. The disorder was not resolved until Traidenis gained the title of grand duke c. 1270.\n\nAlthough his reputation was unsettled during the following centuries and his descendants were not notable, he gained standing during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mindaugas was the only king of Lithuania;[7] while most of the Lithuanian grand dukes from Jogaila onward also reigned as kings of Poland, the titles remained separate. Now generally considered the founder of the Lithuanian state, he is also now credited with stopping the advance of the Tatars towards the Baltic Sea, establishing international recognition of Lithuania, and turning it towards Western civilization.[7][8] In the 1990s the historian Edvardas Gudavi\u010dius published research supporting an exact coronation date \u2013 6 July 1253. This day is now an official national holiday in Lithuania, Statehood Day.\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]### Sources\n\n[edit]Contemporary written sources about Mindaugas are very scarce. Much of what is known about his reign is obtained from the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle and the Hypatian Codex. Both of these chronicles were produced by enemies of Lithuania and thus have anti-Lithuanian bias, particularly the Hypatian Codex.[9] They are also incomplete: both of them lack dates and locations even for the most important events. For example, the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle devoted 125 poetry lines to Mindaugas's coronation, but failed to mention either the date or the location.[10]\n\n*Kronika polska, litewska, \u017cm\u00f3dzka i wszystkiej Rusi*, published by Maciej Stryjkowski in 1582, asserts that in 1240 Mindaugas ascended to his father's throne in Navahrudak. While ruling in Navahrudak and other Rus' castles, he began to eliminate his friends, seduced by the greed for power.[11]: 285\n\n*Boguchwala i Godyslawa Paska* Chronicle describes Mindaugas as a ruthless king of Prussia, who, in 1260, withdrew from the Christian faith and obliterated Mazovian city P\u0142ock and Prussia committing a great slaughter among the Christian people.[12] Other important sources are the papal bulls regarding baptism and coronation of Mindaugas. The Lithuanians did not produce any surviving records themselves, except for a series of acts granting lands to the Livonian Order, but their authenticity is disputed. Due to lack of sources, some important questions regarding Mindaugas and his reign cannot be answered.[9]\n\n### Family\n\n[edit]Because written sources covering the era are scarce, Mindaugas's origins and family tree have not been conclusively established. The Bychowiec Chronicles, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, have been discredited in this regard, since they assert an ancestry from the Palemonids, a noble family said to have originated within the Roman Empire.[13] His year of birth, sometimes given as c. 1200, is at other times left as a question mark.[14][15] His father is mentioned in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle as a powerful duke (*ein kunic gr\u00f4\u00df*), but is not named; later chronicles give his name as Ryngold.[16][17] Dausprungas, mentioned in the text of a 1219 treaty, is presumed to have been his brother, and Dausprungas' sons Tautvilas and Gedvydas his nephews. He is thought to have had two sisters, one married to Vykintas and another to Daniel of Halych. Vykintas and his son Treniota played major roles in later power struggles. Mindaugas had at least two wives, Morta and Morta's sister, whose name is unknown, and possibly an earlier wife; her existence is presumed because two children \u2013 a son named Vai\u0161vilkas and an unnamed daughter married to Svarn in 1255 \u2013 were already leading independent lives when Morta's children were still young. In addition to Vai\u0161vilkas and his sister, two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, are mentioned in written sources. The latter two were assassinated along with Mindaugas. Information on his sons is limited and historians continue to discuss their number. He may have had two other sons whose names were later conflated by scribes into Ruklys and Rupeikis.[16]\n\n### Name\n\n[edit]In the 13th century Lithuania had little contact with foreign lands. Lithuanian names sounded obscure and unfamiliar to various chroniclers, who altered them to sound more like names in their native language.[18] Mindaugas's name in historic texts was recorded in various distorted forms:[19] Mindowe, Mendog, Mindog, Mendolphus[12][20] in Latin; Mindouwe, Myndow, Myndawe, and Mindaw in German; Mendog, Mondog, Mendoch, and Mindovg in Polish; and Mindovg, Mindog, and Mindowh in Old Church Slavonic, among others.[18][ need quotation to verify] Since Old Church Slavonic sources provide the most information about Mindaugas's life, they were judged the most reliable by linguists reconstructing his original Lithuanian name. The most popular Old Church Slavonic rendition was\n\n*Mindovg*, which can quite easily and naturally be reconstructed as\n\n*Mindaugas*or\n\n*Mindaugis*.\n\n[18]\n\n[In 1909 the Lithuanian linguist Kazimieras B\u016bga published a research paper supporting the suffix\n\n*need quotation to verify*]*-as*, which has since been widely accepted.\n\n*Mindaugas*is an archaic dithematic Lithuanian name, used before the Christianization of Lithuania, and consists of two components:\n\n*min*and\n\n*daug*.\n\n[19]Its etymology may be traced to \"daug men\u0105s\" (much wisdom) or \"daugio minimas\" (much fame).\n\n[18]\n\n## Rise to power\n\n[edit]Lithuania was ruled during the early 13th century by a number of dukes and princes presiding over various fiefdoms and tribes.[21] They were loosely bonded by commonalities of religion and tradition, trade, kinship, joint military campaigns, and the presence of captured prisoners from neighboring areas.[15][22] Western merchants and missionaries began seeking control of the area during the 12th century, establishing the city of Riga, Latvia in 1201. Their efforts in Lithuania were temporarily halted by defeat at the Battle of Saule in 1236, but armed Christian orders continued to pose a threat.[23] The country had also undergone incursions by the Mongol Empire.[24]\n\nA treaty with Galicia\u2013Volhynia, signed in 1219, is usually considered the first conclusive evidence that the Baltic tribes in the area were uniting in response to these threats.[25] The treaty's signatories include twenty Lithuanian dukes and one dowager duchess; it specifies that five of these were elder and thus took precedence over the remaining sixteen.[26] Mindaugas, despite his youth, as well as his brother Dausprungas are listed among the elder dukes, implying that they had inherited their titles.[27] The Livonian Rhymed Chronicle describes him as the ruler of all Lithuania in 1236.[28][29] His path to this title is not clear. Ruthenian chronicles mention that he murdered or expelled several dukes, including his relatives.[8][25] Historian S.C. Rowell has described his rise to power as taking place through \"the familiar processes of marriage, murder and military conquest.\"[30] In Rowell's interpretation, Mindaugas recognized the advantage to Christianity in attracting foreign merchants and military support from the Teutonic Order. As a result, in 1251, he was baptised Catholic.[30] The conversion was purely for political gain with Catholic Europe; Mindaugas was known to continue to sacrifice to his old gods after his \"conversion.\"[31] In order to consolidate his power, Mindaugas married into rival families, defeated some in battle, and exiled the rest of his rivals.[30]\n\nDuring the 1230s and 1240s, Mindaugas strengthened and established his power in various Baltic and Slavic lands.[16] Warfare in the region intensified; he battled German forces in Kurland, while the Mongols destroyed Kiev in 1240 and entered Poland in 1241, defeating two Polish armies and burning Krak\u00f3w.[22] The Lithuanian victory in the Battle of Saule temporarily stabilized the northern front, but the Christian orders continued to make gains along the Baltic coast, founding the city of Klaip\u0117da (Memel). Mindaugas established his residence in Navahrudak and succeededed in becoming master of the so-called Black Ruthenia on the upper Neman and its affluents with the cities of Hrodna, Vawkavysk, and Slonim, and also of the Principality of Polotsk.[32] In about 1239 he appointed his son Vai\u0161vilkas to govern these areas, then known as Black Ruthenia.[28] In 1248, he sent his nephews Tautvilas and Edivydas, the sons of his brother Dausprungas, along with Vykintas, the Duke of Samogitia, to conquer Smolensk, but they were unsuccessful. His attempts to consolidate his rule in Lithuania met with mixed success; in 1249, an internal war erupted when he sought to seize his nephews' and Vykintas' lands.[28]\n\n## Path to coronation\n\n[edit]Tautvilas, Edivydas, and Vykintas formed a powerful coalition in opposition to Mindaugas, along with the Samogitians of western Lithuania, the Livonian Order, Daniel of Galicia (Tautvilas and Edivydas' brother-in-law), and Vasilko of Volhynia.[28] The princes of Galicia and Volhynia managed to gain control over Black Ruthenia, disrupting Vai\u0161vilkas' supremacy. Tautvilas strengthened his position by traveling to Riga and accepting baptism by the Archbishop.[15] In 1250, the Order organized a major raid through the lands of Nal\u0161ia into the domains of Mindaugas in Lithuania proper, and a raid into those parts of Samogitia that still supported him.[29] Attacked from the north and south and facing the possibility of unrest elsewhere, Mindaugas was placed in an extremely difficult position, but managed to use the conflicts between the Livonian Order and the Archbishop of Riga to further his own interests. He succeeded in bribing Order Master Andreas von Stierland, who was still angry at Vykintas for the defeat at the Battle of Saule in 1236, by sending him \"many gifts\".[27][29][33]\nIn 1250 or 1251, Mindaugas agreed to receive baptism and relinquish control over some lands in western Lithuania, in return for an acknowledgment by Pope Innocent IV as king. The Pope welcomed a Christian Lithuania as a bulwark against Mongol threats; in turn, Mindaugas sought papal intervention in the ongoing Lithuanian conflicts with the Christian orders.[15][34] On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One ordered the Bishop of Che\u0142mno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and build a cathedral.[35] The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the Holy See, rather than to the Archbishop of Riga.[29] This autonomy was a welcome development.[25] The precise date of Mindaugas's baptism is not known.[15] His wife, two sons, and members of his court were baptized; Pope Innocent wrote later that a multitude of Mindaugas's subjects also received Christianity.[15]\n\nThe process of coronation and the establishment of Christian institutions would take two years. Internal conflicts persisted; during the spring or summer of 1251, Tautvilas and his remaining allies attacked Mindaugas's warriors and the Livonian Order's crossbow-men in Voruta Castle. The attack failed, and Tautvilas' forces retreated to defend themselves in Tviremet Castle (presumed to be Tverai in Samogitia).[36] Vykintas died in 1251 or 1252, and Tautvilas was forced to rejoin Daniel of Galicia.[28]\n\n## The Kingdom of Lithuania\n\n[edit]| Mindaugas's acts granting territories to the Livonian Order [37]\n| |\n|---|---|\n| Date | Territory |\n| July 1253 | Portions of Samogitia (half of Raseiniai, Betygala, Ariogala, and Laukuva \u2013 the other half went to Bishop Christian in March 1254), half of Dainava and Nadruva[38]\n|\n| October 1255 | Selonia |\n| 1257 | Kar\u0161uva, Nadruva, portions of Samogitia |\n| 7 August 1259 | Portions of Dainava, all of Skalva and Samogitia |\n| June 1260 | All of Lithuania (if Mindaugas died without an heir) |\n| 7 August 1261 | All of Selonia |\n\nMindaugas and his wife Morta were crowned during the summer of 1253. Bishop Henry Heidenreich of Kulm presided over the ecclesiastical ceremonies and Andreas Stirland conferred the crown.[15] 6 July is now celebrated as Statehood Day (Lithuanian: *Valstyb\u0117s diena*); it is an official holiday in modern Lithuania.[39] The exact date of the coronation is not known; the scholarship of historian Edvardas Gudavi\u010dius, who promulgated this precise date, is sometimes challenged.[40] The coronation ceremony supposedly took place in Navahrudak in the presence of many dignitaries, such as Bishop of Che\u0142mno Heidenreich, Livonian Master Andreas von Stierland and his brothers Andreas, Johannes the cupbearer, Sittherus the steward, and Theoderic of Hassendorp; from the Preaching Brothers (Dominicans), Brother Sinderamus; from the Minor Brothers (Franciscans), Brother Adolfus and his companions, and many others.[41][11]: 289\n\nRelative peace and stability prevailed for about eight years. Mindaugas used this opportunity to concentrate on the expansion to the east, and to establish and organize state institutions. He strengthened his influence in Black Ruthenia, in Polatsk, a major center of commerce in the Daugava River basin, and in Pinsk.[28] He also negotiated a peace with Galicia\u2013Volhynia, and married his daughter to Svarn, the son of Daniel of Galicia, who would later become Grand Duke of Lithuania. Lithuanian relationships with western Europe and the Holy See were reinforced. In 1255, Mindaugas received permission from Pope Alexander IV to crown his son as King of Lithuania.[29] A noble court, an administrative system, and a diplomatic service were initiated.[16] Silver long coins, an index of statehood, were issued.[16] He sponsored the construction of a cathedral in Vilnius, possibly on the site of today's Vilnius Cathedral.[42]\n\nImmediately after his coronation, Mindaugas transferred some lands to the Livonian Order \u2013 portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava \u2013 although his control over these western lands was tenuous.[24][40] There has been much discussion among historians as to whether in later years (1255\u20131261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the order. The deeds might have been falsified by the order;[28] the case for this scenario is bolstered by the fact that some of the documents mention lands that were not actually under the control of Mindaugas[25] and by various irregularities in treaty witnesses and seals.[37]\n\nMindaugas and his antagonist Daniel reached a reconciliation in 1255; the Black Ruthenian lands were transferred to Roman, Daniel's son. Afterwards Mindaugas's son Vai\u0161vilkas received baptism as a member of the Orthodox faith, becoming a monk and later founding a convent and monastery.[16][43] Tautvilas's antagonism was temporarily resolved when he recognized Mindaugas's superiority and received Polatsk as a fiefdom.[28] A direct confrontation with the Mongols occurred in 1258 or 1259, when Berke Khan sent his general Burundai to challenge Lithuanian rule, ordering Daniel and other regional princes to participate. The Novgorod Chronicle describes the following action as a defeat of the Lithuanians, but it has also been seen as a net gain for Mindaugas.[33]\n\nA single sentence in the Hypatian Chronicle mentions Mindaugas defending himself in Voruta against his nephews and Duke Vykintas; two other sources mention \"his castle\". The location of Voruta is not specified, and this has led to considerable speculation, along with archeological research, concerning the seat of his court. At least fourteen locations have been proposed, including Kernav\u0117 and Vilnius.[44] The ongoing formal archeological digs at Kernav\u0117 began in 1979 after a portion of the site named \"Mindaugas Throne hill-fort\" collapsed.[45] The town now hosts a major celebration on Statehood Day.[46]\n\n## Assassination and aftermath\n\n[edit]The Livonian Order used their alliance with Mindaugas to gain control over Samogitian lands. In 1252 he approved the Order's construction of Klaipeda Castle.[47] Their governance, however, was seen as oppressive. Local merchants could only conduct transactions via Order-approved intermediaries; inheritance laws were changed; and the choices among marriage partners and residencies were restricted.[22] Several pitched battles ensued. In 1259 the Order lost the Battle of Skuodas, and in 1260 it lost the Battle of Durbe. The first defeat encouraged a rebellion by the Semigalians, and the defeat at Durbe spurred the Prussians into the Great Prussian Rebellion, which lasted for 14 years.[16] Encouraged by these developments and by his nephew Treniota, Mindaugas broke peace with the Order. The gains he had expected from Christianization had proven to be minor.[23]\n\nMindaugas may have reverted to paganism afterwards. His motivation for conversion is often described by modern historians as merely strategic.[48][49] The case for his apostasy rests largely on two near-contemporary sources: a 1324 assertion by Pope John XXII that Mindaugas had returned to error, and the Galician\u2013Volhynian Chronicle.[15] The chronicler writes that Mindaugas continued to practice paganism, making sacrifices to his gods, burning corpses, and conducting pagan rites in public.[50] Historians have pointed to the possibility of bias in this account, since Mindaugas had been at war with Volhynia.[15][51] Pope Clement IV, on the other hand, wrote in 1268 of \"Mindaugas of happy memory\" (*clare memorie Mindota*), expressing regret at his murder.[15]\n\nIn any event, the Lithuanians were not prepared to accept Christianity, and Mindaugas's baptism had little impact on further developments.[16] The majority of the population and the nobility remained pagan; his subjects were not required to convert.[5][49] The cathedral he had built in Vilnius was superseded by a pagan temple, and all the diplomatic achievements made after his coronation were lost, although the practice of Christianity and intermarriage were well tolerated.[16][23][34]\n\nRegional conflicts with the Order escalated. Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod, Tautvilas, and Tautvilas's son Constantine agreed to form a coalition in opposition to Mindaugas, but their plans were unsuccessful.[15] Treniota emerged as the leader of the Samogitian resistance; he led an army to C\u0113sis\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_eMGPIvFkr8yH8eI8iSmBB7Gr\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"Peter Bonerz 'fire' film 'arson' 'fireman' '1960s' 'supporting role' 'fire' 'movie'\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"No results returned for query: Peter Bonerz 'fire' film 'arson' 'fireman' '1960s' 'supporting role' 'fire' 'movie'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step-by-step (sources shown):\n\n1.

One of these performance spaces, a converted industrial site in a maritime county, initially served the purpose of preparing a specific agricultural grain for the brewing industry. This grain, when processed into a finely ground powder, is utilized in baking specific types of bread; a special version of this powder comes from the grain after it undergoes a particular transformative treatment. This transformative treatment, which involves controlled sprouting and drying, is vital for creating a primary ingredient used in making certain fermented beverages and spirits. The flour produced through this treatment is sometimes incorporated to enhance the taste of a distinctively sweet and dense baked item, popular in an island nation. A culinary relative of this item from a northern European region often uses a key brewing liquid in its recipe, from which part of its local name is derived.

From 1863 to 1864, he was concurrently Duke of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg.\n\nA younger son of Frederick William, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg, Christian grew up in the Duchy of Schleswig as a prince of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg, a junior branch of the House of Oldenburg which had ruled Denmark since 1448. Although having close family ties to the Danish royal family, he was originally not in the immediate line of succession to the Danish throne. Following the early death of his father in 1831, Christian grew up in Denmark and was educated at the Military Academy of Copenhagen. After unsuccessfully seeking the hand of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in marriage, he married his double second cousin, Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel, in 1842.\n\nIn 1852, Christian was chosen as heir presumptive to the Danish throne in light of the expected extinction of the senior line of the House of Oldenburg. Upon the death of King Frederick VII in 1863, Christian (who was Frederick's second cousin and husband of Frederick's paternal first cousin, Louise of Hesse-Kassel) acceded to the throne as the first Danish monarch of the House of Gl\u00fccksburg.[1]\n\nThe beginning of his reign was marked by the Danish defeat in the Second Schleswig War and the subsequent loss of the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg which made the king immensely unpopular. The following years of his reign were dominated by political disputes, for Denmark had only become a constitutional monarchy in 1849 and the balance of power between the sovereign and parliament was still in dispute. In spite of his initial unpopularity and the many years of political strife, in which the king was in conflict with large parts of the population, his popularity recovered towards the end of his reign, and he became a national icon due to the length of his reign and the high standards of personal morality with which he was identified.\n\nChristian's six children with Louise married into other European royal families, earning him the sobriquet \"the father-in-law of Europe\". Among his descendants are King Frederik X, King Philippe of Belgium, King Harald V of Norway, Grand Duke Guillaume V of Luxembourg, King Charles III of the United Kingdom, and King Felipe VI of Spain.[2]\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]### Birth and family\n\n[edit]Christian IX was born between 10 and 11 a.m. on 8 April 1818 at the residence of his maternal grandparents, Gottorf Castle, near the town of Schleswig in the Duchy of Schleswig, at the time a fief under the Crown of Denmark.[3] Born as a prince of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, he was the fourth son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, and Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel.[4] He was named after his mother's cousin Prince Christian Frederick of Denmark, the later King Christian VIII, who was also his godfather. Together with his wife, Caroline Amalie of Augustenborg, he had traveled from Augustenborg to Gottorp so that he could hold his godson at the christening, which was held at the end of May in the chapel of Gottorp Castle.[3]\n\nPrince Christian's father was the head of the ducal house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, a junior male branch of the House of Oldenburg. The family descended from King Christian III of Denmark's younger son, John the Younger, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, whose grandson Duke August Philipp severed his ties with Denmark and emigrated to Germany where he acquired the manor of Haus Beck in Westphalia, after which the lineage was named Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck.[5] His sons and their descendants went into Prussian, Polish and Russian service, until his great-great-grandson, Prince Christian's father, again went into Danish military service, where he was stationed in Holstein.[6] It was there that he had met and married Prince Christian's mother, who was a daughter of Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, an originally German prince, who, however, had grown up at the Danish court and had married King Frederick V's youngest daughter, Princess Louise of Denmark. Prince Charles had made a career in Denmark, where he was a Danish field marshal and Royal Governor of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein.[7]\n\nThrough his father, Prince Christian was thus a direct male-line descendant of King Christian III of Denmark and an (albeit junior) agnatic descendant of Hedvig of Holstein (countess of Oldenburg), mother of King Christian I of Denmark, who was the \"semi-Salic\" heiress of her brother Adolf of Schauenburg, last Schauenburg duke of Schleswig and count of Holstein. As such, Prince Christian was eligible to succeed in the twin duchies of Schleswig-Holstein, but not first in line. Through his mother, he was thus a great-grandson of Frederick V, great-great-grandson of George II of Great Britain and a descendant of several other monarchs, but had no direct claim to any European throne.\n\n### Childhood\n\n[edit]Initially, the young prince grew up with his parents and many brothers and sisters at his maternal grandparents' residence at Gottorf Castle, the habitual seat of the royal governors of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. However, in 1824, the dowager duchess of Gl\u00fccksburg, widow of Frederick Henry William, the last duke of the elder line of the house Schleswig-Holstein-S\u00f8nderborg-Gl\u00fccksburg, who had himself died in 1779, died. Gl\u00fccksburg Castle, located a little south of Flensburg Fjord, not far from city of Flensburg, was now empty, and on 6 July 1825, Duke Friedrich Wilhelm was appointed Duke of Gl\u00fccksburg by his brother-in-law, King Frederick VI of Denmark.[8] Duke Friedrich Wilhelm subsequently changed his title to Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg and thus founded the younger Gl\u00fccksburg line.[9]\n\nSubsequently, the family moved to Gl\u00fccksburg Castle, where Prince Christian was raised with his siblings under their father's supervision. The Duke wrote to a friend:\n\nI raise my sons with rigor, that these may learn to obey, without, however, failing to make them available to the requirements and demands of the present.\n\n[10]\n\nHowever, Duke Friedrich Wilhelm died of a cold that had developed into pneumonia at the age of just 46 on 17 February 1831 and, at the Duke's own discretion, scarlet fever, which had previously affected two of his children. His death left the duchess widowed with ten children and no money. Prince Christian was twelve years old when his father died.\n\n### Education\n\n[edit]Following the early death of his father, King Frederick VI, together with Prince William of Hesse-Philippstal-Barchfeld, a close friend of the Duke, became legal guardians of Prince Christian and his nine siblings.[10] That same year, Prince Christian wanted to be educated as a naval officer, but during King Frederick VI's visit to Gottorp in 1831, shortly after Duke Wilhelm's funeral, the king agreed with his mother that Prince Christian would be sent to Copenhagen to receive an army officer training. Subsequently, in 1832, the year after his father's death, the 14-year-old Prince Christian moved to Copenhagen to be educated at the Land Cadet Academy, where he stayed at the house of Colonel Linde, the head of the Land Cadet Academy. He received private lessons at the academy and was rarely with the other cadets.[10][11] On the other hand, the sonless royal couple took good care of the boy, as Queen Marie was his mother's sister and King Frederick VI his mother's cousin. Also, in 1838, Prince Christian's eldest brother, Duke Karl of Gl\u00fccksborg, married the king and queen's youngest daughter, Princess Vilhelmine Marie, which further strengthened the bonds between them.\n\nIn 1835, Prince Christian was confirmed in the Garrison Church in Copenhagen. The following year, after completing his military education, he was appointed rittmeister at the Royal Horse Guards and was then housed in the Royal Horse Guards Barracks by Frederiksholms Kanal in central Copenhagen. There he lived under simple conditions until King Frederick VI in 1839 granted him a home in the Yellow Palace, an 18th century town house at 18 Amaliegade, immediately adjacent to the Amalienborg Palace complex, the principal residence of the Danish royal family in the district of Frederiksstaden in central Copenhagen, where he came to live until 1865.[10]\n\nFrom 1839 to 1841, Prince Christian studied constitutional law and history with his half-cousin Prince Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel at the University of Bonn in Germany. It was there that in December 1839 he received the news of the death of his benefactor King Frederick VI and the accession of his mother's cousin, King Christian VIII. During the holidays he went on various excursions in Germany and also traveled to Venice. In 1841 he returned to Copenhagen. On the way home, he paid a visit to the court in Berlin, where he rejected an otherwise flattering offer from King Frederick William IV of Prussia to join the Prussian Army.[12]\n\n## Becoming the heir presumptive\n\n[edit]### Marriage\n\n[edit]As a young man, in 1838, Prince Christian, representing Frederick VI, attended the coronation of Queen Victoria at Westminster Abbey.[13] During his stay in London, he unsuccessfully sought the hand of the young British queen in marriage. Even though she chose to follow her family's wishes and preferred to marry her cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the young queen had a good impression of her third cousin Prince Christian, who 25 years later would become father-in-law to her eldest son, the Prince of Wales.[14]\n\nInstead, Prince Christian entered into a marriage that was to have great significance for his future. In 1841, he was engaged to his second cousin Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel.[13] She was the daughter of Prince William of Hesse-Kassel, who was a Danish general and the governor of Copenhagen. Prince William was married to Christian VIII of Denmark's sister Princess Charlotte of Denmark, and Louise was thus the new king's niece and was closely related to the royal family. Like Prince Christian himself, she was a great-granddaughter of both Frederick V of Denmark and Landgrave Frederick II of Hesse-Kassel, and thus his double second cousin. Their wedding was celebrated on 26 May 1842 in her parents' residence in Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg.[13] The bride and groom took their bridal tour to Kiel in the Duchy of Holstein, where they visited Prince Christian's older brother, Duke Karl of Gl\u00fccksburg, and his wife, Frederick VI's daughter Princess Vilhelmine Marie, who had not been able to attend the wedding.[15]\n\nLouise was a wise and energetic woman who exercised a strong influence over her husband. After the wedding, the couple moved into the Yellow Palace, where their first five children were born between 1843 and 1853: Prince Frederick in 1843, Princess Alexandra in 1844, Prince William in 1845, Princess Dagmar in 1847 and Princess Thyra in 1853.[16] The family was still quite unknown and lived a relatively modest life by royal standards.\n\n### The Danish succession crisis\n\n[edit]In the 1840s, it became increasingly clear that the Danish monarchy was facing a succession crisis. When King Christian VIII succeeded his first cousin King Frederick VI in 1839, the elder male line of the House of Oldenburg was obviously on the point of extinction, as the king's only son and heir apparent Crown Prince Frederick seemed incapable of fathering children and the king's only brother Prince Ferdinand's marriage to King Frederick VI's daughter was childless.[17] King Frederick VII's childlessness presented a thorny dilemma and the question of succession to the Danish throne proved complex, as the rules of succession in the different parts of the Danish monarchy united under the king's rule, the Kingdom of Denmark proper and the three duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg, not being the same, the possibility of a separation of the crown of Denmark from its duchies became probable.[18]\n\nThe succession in the Kingdom of Denmark was regulated by the *Lex Regia* (Danish: *Kongeloven*; *Law of The King*), the absolutist constitution of Denmark and Norway promulgated by Frederick III in 1665.[19] With the Lex Regia, Denmark had adopted the Salic law, but restricted the succession to the agnatic descendants of Frederick III, who was the first hereditary monarch of Denmark (before him, the kingdom was officially elective). Agnatic descent from Frederick III would end with the death of the childless Frederick VII and his equally childless uncle, Prince Ferdinand. At that point, the Lex Regia provided for a semi-Salic succession, which stipulated that after the extinction of all-male descendance, including all collateral male lines, a female agnate (such as a daughter) of the last male holder of the property would inherit, and after her, her own male heirs according to the Salic order. There were, however, several ways to interpret to whom the crown could pass, since the provision was not entirely clear as to whether a claimant to the throne could be the closest female relative or not. In the duchy of Holstein, where the king reigned as duke, the rules of succession also followed the Salic law, but did not limit the succession to the agnatic descendants of Frederick III. As there were several junior male lines of the House of Oldenburg, who were however not descendants of Frederick III, there were thus numerous agnatic descendants with succession rights in the Duchy of Holstein, who were however not eligible to succeed to the Danish throne. In addition, the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were permanently joined to each other by the Treaty of Ribe of 1460, which proclaimed that the two duchies should be \"Forever Undivided\".\n\nThe already complicated dynastic question of the succession was made even more complex as it took place against a background of equally complicated political issues. The movements of nationalism and liberalism had been on the rise in Europe since the Napoleonic era. Whereas the concepts of nation and homeland increasingly replaced dynastic questions for the nationalists, aristocratic privileges and the concept of an absolute ruler of divine right were poorly accepted by the liberals. Denmark and the Duchies were no exception, and the political movement of national liberalism had been on the rise since the 1830s. While the Danish and German national liberals were united in their liberal political aspirations and in their opposition to the absolutist rule of the House of Oldenburg, the two political movements were heavily opposed in the national question. It mainly concerned the question of the affiliation of the Duchy of Schleswig. Constitutionally, the Duchy of Schleswig was a Danish fief, which had become increasingly independent from Denmark during the High Middle Ages. Linguistically, however, Danish, German and North Frisian existed as vernaculars in different parts of the Duchy, and German functioned as the language of law and the ruling class.\n\nThe Danish national liberals insisted that Schleswig as a fief had belonged to Denmark for centuries and aimed to restore the southern frontier of Denmark on the Eider river, the historic border between Schleswig and Holstein. The Danish nationalists thus aspired to incorporate the Duchy of Schleswig into the Danish kingdom, in the process separating it from the duchy of Holstein, which should be allowed to pursue its own destiny as a member of the German Confederation or possibly a new united Germany. With the claim of the total integration of Schleswig into the Danish kingdom, the Danish national liberals opposed the German national liberals, whose goal was the union of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, their joint independence from Denmark and their membership in the German Confederation as an autonomous German state. The German nationalists thus sought to confirm Schleswig's association with Holstein, in the process detaching Schleswig from Denmark and bringing it into the German Confederation.\n\nThere was burgeoning nationalism within both Denmark and the German-speaking parts of Schleswig-Holstein. This meant that a resolution to keep the two Duchies together and as a part of the Danish kingdom could not satisfy the conflicting interests of both Danish and German nationalists, and hindered all hopes of a peaceful solution.\n\nAs the nations of Europe looked on, the numerous descendants of Hedvig of Holstein began to vie for the Danish throne. Frederick VII belonged to the senior branch of Hedvig's descendants. In the event of extinction of the senior branch, the house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg would become the most senior branch of the House of Oldenburg, but it did not descend from King Frederick III. However, in the duchies, Christian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, claimed the position of heir to the throne of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, being head of the house of Augustenburg, and thus became a symbol of the nationalist German independence movement in Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThe closest female relatives of Frederick VII were his paternal aunt, Princess Louise Charlotte of Denmark, who had married a scion of the cadet branch of the House of Hesse, and her children. However, they were not agnatic descendants of the royal family, so were not eligible to succeed in Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThe dynastic female heir reckoned most eligible according to the original law of primogeniture of Frederick III was Princess Caroline of Denmark (1793\u20131881), the childless eldest daughter of the late king Frederick VI. Along with another childless daughter, Princess Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark (1808\u20131891), Duchess of Gl\u00fccksburg; the next heir was Louise, sister of Frederick VI, who had married the Duke of Augustenburg. The chief heir to that line was the selfsame Frederick of Augustenburg, but his turn would have come only after the death of two childless princesses who were very much alive in 1863.\n\nThe House of Gl\u00fccksburg also held a significant interest in the succession to the throne. A more junior branch of the royal family, they were also descendants of Frederick III through the daughter of King Frederick V of Denmark. Lastly, there was yet a more junior agnatic branch that was eligible to succeed in Schleswig-Holstein. There was Christian himself and his three older brothers, the eldest of whom, Karl, was childless, but the others had produced children, and male children at that.\n\nPrince Christian had been a foster \"grandson\" of the grandchildless royal couple Frederick VI and his Queen consort Marie (Marie Sophie Friederike of Hesse). Familiar with the royal court and the traditions of the recent monarchs, their young ward Prince Christian was a nephew of Queen Marie and a first cousin once removed of Frederick VI. He had been brought up as a Dane, having lived in Danish-speaking lands of the royal dynasty and not having become a German nationalist, which made \n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_35qMdM3VofjtxGsEips18UVF\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"mayor assumed office after career in timber 'timber' 'career in timber' 'mayor' 'platform included safety' 'ambitious safety goals' coastal city mayor 'timber industry' 'assumed office' 'mayor-elect'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] Heritage Pamphlet - Keesler Air Force Base\nURL: https:\/\/www.keesler.af.mil\/Portals\/14\/documents\/History\/Heritage%20Pamphlet%2028%20AUG%202025.pdf\nBase shelters opened that afternoon at 5:00 p.m., and the 45th Airlift Squadron and 403rd Wing deployed their aircraft to safe zones.

He received a B.S. in Civil Engineering from the University of Alabama in 1975, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon and Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity.[5][6]\n\nStimpson began a nearly 40-year career in his family's lumber manufacturing business. Starting at an early age, he worked his way up through virtually every position in the family business including serving as its CFO and ultimately its Executive Vice President.\n\nStimpson is married to Jean Miller of Brewton, Alabama. They have been married since 1975 and have four grown, married children and 14 grandchildren. They are longtime, active members of Ashland Place United Methodist Church.[7]\n\nMayor Stimpson\u2019s civic and business endeavors, both locally and statewide, have been numerous and varied. He has served on the boards of the Boys & Girls Club of Southwest Alabama; the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce; the conservative think tank, the Alabama Policy Institute; the Business Council of Alabama; and the University of Alabama President\u2019s Cabinet.[8]\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]Upon graduating from the University of Alabama, Stimpson began a 37-year career with Gulf Lumber Company and its successor, Scotch & Gulf Lumber. He was chief financial officer prior to leaving the company to run for office in 2012.[9]\n\n### Mayor of Mobile\n\n[edit]He was elected August 27, 2013, with 54% of the vote, defeating incumbent Mayor Sam Jones.[10] Stimpson ran on a platform of public safety and economic development.[11][12][13][14] Stimpson was elected largely as a result of a surge in white voters, and received only single-digit support from African American voters.[15]\n\nIn 2017, Stimpson was reelected with 59% of the vote over Jones in a rematch.[16] He again polled in single digits with African American voters.[17] In 2021, he defeated Fred Richardson[ who?] and Karlos Finley\n\n[with 62.5% of the vote.\n\n*who?*][18]In 2025, he decided to not run for reelection.\n\n[4]\n\nUnder Stimpson, Mobile has seen reductions in bonded indebtedness by nearly $100 million and unfunded liabilities for pension and benefits by $200 million, leading to credit rating increases from both Moody's and S&P. During the same period, he has built and maintained a two-month rainy day reserve fund and awarded six raises totaling 17% for city employees.[19][20] Stimpson and his team made changes to streamline and simplify the city procurement process, and launched the city\u2019s first supplier diversity program.[21][22][23][24] Stimpson and his team have introduced initiatives such as Map for Mobile and the city\u2019s first supplier diversity program.[25][26][27][28]\n\nHowever, Stimpson has also repeatedly opposed environmental protection initiatives and health and safety legislation, despite severe pollution levels in Mobile.[29] Stimpson's administration has systematically reduced funding for the arts and heritage, substantially reducing allocations to the Historic Mobile Preservation Society, the Mobile Arts Council, the Mobile Opera, the Mobile Symphony Orchestra, and other local museums, which led to a number of layoffs.[30]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Sandy Stimpson elected as Mayor of Mobile\" Archived 2013-08-30 at the Wayback Machine, wkrg.com, August 27, 2013**^**\"Mayor Stimpson Wins Re-Election\"**^**\"Election Results\". 30 April 2022.- ^\n**a**Everett, Grayson (2024-09-27). \"Who might run for Mayor of Mobile?\".**b***Yellowhammer News*.

It is the third-most populous county in the state after Jefferson and Madison counties. As of the 2020 census, its population was 414,809.[2] Its county seat is Mobile, which was founded as a deepwater port on the Mobile River. The only such port in Alabama, it has long been integral to the economy for providing access to inland waterways as well as the Gulf of Mexico.[3]\n\nThe city, river, and county were named in honor of *Maubila*, a village of the paramount chief Tuskaloosa of the regional Mississippian culture. In 1540 he arranged an ambush of soldiers of Hernando de Soto's expedition in an effort to expel them from the territory. The Spaniards were armed with guns and killed many of the tribe. Mobile County and Washington County, Alabama make up the Mobile Metropolitan Statistical Area with a 2020 population of 430,197. The Mobile, AL MSA and Daphne-Fairhope-Foley, AL MSA make up the much larger Mobile-Daphne-Fairhope CSA with a 2020 population of 661,964.\n\nThe northern border of Mobile County and southern area of neighboring Washington County constitute the homeland of the state-recognized tribe of MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, descendants of Choctaw and Creek who stayed in this area during the period of Indian Removal. They have organized to preserve their culture and language. They were the first of nine tribes to be recognized by the state.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]This area was occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of Spanish expeditions in the early 16th century, it was part of the territory of the Mississippian culture, which constructed major earthwork mounds. It was ruled by the paramount chief Tuskaloosa.\n\nThe historic Choctaw emerged somewhat later, and are believed to be descendants of those earlier peoples. They occupied this area along what early French traders and colonists called the Mobile River. They also founded the settlement of Mobile on the river and bay in the early 18th century.\n\nThe British took over the territory in 1763 (along with other French territories east of the Mississippi River) after defeating the French in the Seven Years' War. During the American Revolutionary War, it came under Spanish rule as part of Spanish Florida. Spain ceded the territory to the United States after the War of 1812.\n\nIn the 1830s, the United States forced the removal of most of the Native American tribes in the area under President Andrew Jackson's policy and an act of Congress to relocate them to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Many of those who remained continued their culture, and took refuge in the swamps in the border area between Mobile and Washington counties. Since the late 20th century, several tribes have reorganized and gained state recognition. Among those is the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, which was recognized as a tribe in 1979 by the state. The people have long been based in this area of the former Choctaw homeland, along the northern border of Mobile County and the southern border of Washington County.\n\nAfter more than a century of European settlement, beginning with French colonists, Mobile County was organized by the state legislature and the proclamation of Governor Holmes of the Mississippi Territory on December 18, 1812.[1]\nWhen Mississippi was separated and admitted as a state on December 10, 1817, after adopting its constitution on August 15, 1817, Mobile County became part of what was called the Alabama Territory. Two years later, the county became part of the state of Alabama, granted statehood on December 14, 1819.[4][5]\n\nThe city of Mobile, first settled by French colonists in the early 18th century as part of *La Louisiane,* was designated as the county seat from the early days of the county.[1] Both the county and city derive their name from Fort Louis de la Mobile, a French fortification established (near present-day Axis, Alabama) in 1702. The word \"Mobile\" is believed to stem from a Choctaw word for \"paddlers\".[1] The area was occupied by French colonists from 1702 to 1763, and their influence has been strong in the city. It was ruled by the British from 1763 to 1780, when more American colonists began to enter the territory; and controlled by the Spanish from 1780 to 1813.\n\nAt the end of the War of 1812, the United States took over the territory. At that time, new settlers were being attracted to the land, eager to develop short-staple cotton in the uplands area. Invention of the cotton gin made processing of this type of cotton profitable, stimulating wholesale development of new cotton plantations in the Black Belt during the antebellum years. Mobile developed as a major deepwater port; in the nineteenth century, cotton was its major export.\n\nThere were nine documented lynchings in Mobile from 1891 to 1981.\n\n- March 31, 1891 \u2014 Zachariah Graham\n[6] - October 2, 1906 \u2014 Roy Hoyle\n[7] - October 2, 1906 \u2014 Willie Thompson\n[8] - October 2, 1906 \u2014 Corneilius Robinson\n[9] - September 22, 1907 \u2014 Mose Dossett\n[10] - January 23, 1909 \u2014 Richard Robertson\n[11] - July 31, 1910 \u2014 Bill Walker\n[12] - June 6, 1919 \u2014 James E.

The last Democrat to win the county was John F. Kennedy in 1960 and is one of only 7 counties in Alabama to back Gerald Ford over Jimmy Carter in 1976. Within the city of Mobile, the margins between the Republican and Democrat candidates are usually between 10 and 19 points. Since 1996, the Democrats have gotten 40-45% of the vote.\n\n| Year | Republican | Democratic | Third party(ies) | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| \u2116 | % | \u2116 | % | \u2116 | % | |\n1824\n|\n155 | 38.08% | 205 | 50.37%\n|\n47 | 11.55% |\n1828\n|\n178 | 31.01% | 396 | 68.99%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1832\n|\n0 | 0.00% | 331 | 100.00%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1836\n|\n739 | 46.04% | 866 | 53.96%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1840\n|\n1,481 | 56.92%\n|\n1,121 | 43.08% | 0 | 0.00% |\n1844\n|\n1,403 | 51.02%\n|\n1,347 | 48.98% | 0 | 0.00% |\n1848\n|\n1,319 | 55.14%\n|\n1,073 | 44.86% | 0 | 0.00% |\n1852\n|\n1,123 | 43.24% | 1,380 | 53.14%\n|\n94 | 3.62% |\n1856\n|\n0 | 0.00% | 1,838 | 50.93%\n|\n1,771 | 49.07% |\n1860\n|\n0 | 0.00% | 1,823 | 36.51%\n|\n3,170 | 63.49% |\n1868\n|\n5,200 | 43.85% | 6,658 | 56.15%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1872\n|\n5,946 | 47.69% | 6,522 | 52.31%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1876\n|\n4,272 | 44.49% | 5,330 | 55.51%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1880\n|\n3,239 | 44.84% | 3,784 | 52.38%\n|\n201 | 2.78% |\n1884\n|\n2,787 | 49.69% | 2,806 | 50.03%\n|\n16 | 0.29% |\n1888\n|\n2,542 | 44.98% | 3,109 | 55.02%\n|\n0 | 0.00% |\n1892\n|\n397 | 5.63% | 4,680 | 66.33%\n|\n1,979 | 28.05% |\n1896\n|\n2,778 | 37.76% | 3,948 | 53.66%\n|\n631 | 8.58% |\n1900\n|\n2,243 | 41.64% | 2,939 | 54.56%\n|\n205 | 3.81% |\n1904\n|\n325 | 8.84% | 3,283 | 89.33%\n|\n67 | 1.82% |\n1908\n|\n453 | 14.03% | 2,422 | 75.03%\n|\n353 | 10.94% |\n1912\n|\n140 | 3.72% | 3,009 | 79.98%\n|\n613 | 16.29% |\n1916\n|\n832 | 21.36% | 2,968 | 76.18%\n|\n96 | 2.46% |\n1920\n|\n2,681 | 29.71% | 6,171 | 68.39%\n|\n171 | 1.90% |\n1924\n|\n1,814 | 28.54% | 4,125 | 64.91%\n|\n416 | 6.55% |\n1928\n|\n5,058 | 45.84% | 5,965 | 54.07%\n|\n10 | 0.09% |\n1932\n|\n1,705 | 14.90% | 9,658 | 84.42%\n|\n78 | 0.68% |\n1936\n|\n1,072 | 8.64% | 11,165 | 89.95%\n|\n175 | 1.41% |\n1940\n|\n1,887 | 13.99% | 11,480 | 85.08%\n|\n126 | 0.93% |\n1944\n|\n2,867 | 23.08% | 9,439 | 75.98%\n|\n117 | 0.94% |\n1948\n|\n2,685 | 19.41% | 0 | 0.00% | 11,150 | 80.59%\n|\n1952\n|\n14,153 | 49.29% | 14,473 | 50.40%\n|\n89 | 0.31% |\n1956\n|\n20,639 | 52.21%\n|\n17,163 | 43.41% | 1,732 | 4.38% |\n1960\n|\n24,608 | 45.12% | 28,626 | 52.48%\n|\n1,308 | 2.40% |\n1964\n|\n49,493 | 70.72%\n|\n0 | 0.00% | 20,488 | 29.28% |\n1968\n|\n10,509 | 11.43% | 18,615 | 20.25% | 62,812 | 68.32%\n|\n1972\n|\n62,639 | 73.15%\n|\n20,694 | 24.17% | 2,301 | 2.69% |\n1976\n|\n53,835 | 50.85%\n|\n50,264 | 47.47% | 1,777 | 1.68% |\n1980\n|\n67,515 | 57.71%\n|\n46,180 | 39.47% | 3,297 | 2.82% |\n1984\n|\n81,923 | 62.56%\n|\n47,252 | 36.08% | 1,784 | 1.36% |\n1988\n|\n72,203 | 60.88%\n|\n45,524 | 38.39% | 870 | 0.73% |\n1992\n|\n72,935 | 50.72%\n|\n54,962 | 38.22% | 15,891 | 11.05% |\n1996\n|\n66,775 | 51.32%\n|\n54,749 | 42.08% | 8,579 | 6.59% |\n2000\n|\n78,162 | 55.93%\n|\n58,640 | 41.96% | 2,943 | 2.11% |\n2004\n|\n92,014 | 58.69%\n|\n63,732 | 40.65% | 1,025 | 0.65% |\n2008\n|\n98,049 | 54.04%\n|\n82,181 | 45.30% | 1,194 | 0.66% |\n2012\n|\n94,893 | 54.18%\n|\n78,760 | 44.97% | 1,487 | 0.85% |\n2016\n|\n95,116 | 55.06%\n|\n72,186 | 41.79% | 5,435 | 3.15% |\n2020\n|\n101,243 | 55.27%\n|\n79,474 | 43.39% | 2,447 | 1.34% |\n2024\n|\n100,759 | 57.52%\n|\n72,055 | 41.14% | 2,350 | 1.34% |\n\n## Communities\n\n[edit]### Cities\n\n[edit]- Bayou La Batre\n- Chickasaw\n- Citronelle\n- Creola\n- Mobile (county seat)\n- Prichard\n- Saraland\n- Satsuma\n- Semmes\n\n### Towns\n\n[edit]### Census-designated places\n\n[edit]### Unincorporated communities\n\n[edit]### Ghost town\n\n[edit]## See also\n\n[edit]- National Register of Historic Places listings in Mobile, Alabama\n- National Register of Historic Places listings in Mobile County, Alabama\n- Properties on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in Mobile County, Alabama\n\n## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b****c****d**\"Mobile County, Alabama history\".

He was ethnically perhaps the most Danish Prince of the Danish Royal dynasty in his generation (at the time of Denmark's most recent succession crisis).\n\nHis family belonged to the House of Oldenburg, the royal house that included all the medieval Scandinavian royal dynasties among its distant forebears - which it shared with his rivals and relatives, other claimants to the Danish throne. Both lines claim descent from the medieval Danish House of Estridsen via Christian I of Denmark's ancestress Richeza of Denmark, Lady of Werle, the daughter of Eric V of Denmark, but Frederick also descended from Eric V's son Christopher II of Denmark whom no heir or monarch of Denmark had been descended from since Christopher III of Denmark. Frederik's paternal grandfather happened to have both grandfathers who were \"Royal\" dukes from the Oldenburg dynasty.\n\nFrederick also differed from his rivals in his specific ancestry among the contemporary Danish high nobility. His mother was from an ancient Danish family (Danneskiold-Sams\u00f8e), and his paternal grandmother Louise Auguste of Denmark was its royal princess. His paternal grandfather Frederik Christian II, Duke of Augustenborg numbered two ladies of Danish high nobility as his grandmothers (Danneskiold-Sams\u00f8e and Reventlow), and one Danish Countess as paternal great-grandmother (Ahlefeldt-Langeland). Frederick's family had high hopes that in the then-rising era of nationalism, this ancestry would be viewed with favour when the legal question over whose claim was strongest would be decided. The family groomed Frederick to become a King of Denmark.\n\nUnfortunately, Frederick, despite his more ethnically Danish ancestry was to become a symbol of German nationalism. Insider circles of Danish Royal government, for various reasons, were not favourable to the Augustenburgs. Instead, the Princess of Hesse and Prince of Glucksburg, closer relatives of the then royal family's core, were preferred. Prince Frederick's father became a protagonist in the 1848-1851 First Schleswig War, to the hostility of Danish nationalists.\n\nPrince Frederick's inherited claims were strongest to the almost wholly German-speaking Duchy of Holstein, while his rights as the heir-male of the House of Oldenburg proved too difficult to pursue, and Holstein, an originally Holy Roman Empire fief, had the Salic Law as a leading principle in its fundamental succession law. Schleswig and Denmark, much more Scandinavian in legal history, had legal precedents for elective and female succession. Frederick and his father, however Danish they actually were, realised this and leant towards German interests.\n\nYoung Frederick's father found himself in an untenable position after the collapse of Prussian support and defeat of his own government at the end of the First Schleswig War in 1851. He renounced his claims as first in line to inherit the twin duchies in favour of the king of Denmark and his successors on 31 March 1852 in return for a financial compensation. The ducal family was banished.[1]\nFrederick now became the symbol of the nationalist German independence movement in Schleswig-Holstein. The renunciation was a hurdle which was explained away by the Augustenburg dynasty and the German nationalists as not having any effect on Frederick, who had not personally renounced anything and on whose behalf no one, including the father, was empowered to make renunciations. Frederick's marriage in 1856 was part of an appeal to German nationalism (however, his younger brother married a daughter of Queen Victoria).\n\nIn November 1863 Frederick claimed the twin-duchies in succession after the death without a male heir of King Frederick VII of Denmark, who was also the Duke of Schleswig and Holstein. As Holstein was inherited after the salic law among descendants of Hedwig of Holstein, the independence movement had long nourished hopes that the king's death would lead to their goal. The Kingdom of Denmark was also under so-called Semi-Salic Law, but its male line ended with Frederick VII and Danish law contained a Semi-Salic provision which resulted in the election of Christian of Gl\u00fccksburg as new monarch. German nationalists claimed that Schleswig was also inherited according to the unmodified Salic Law, but this claim was refused by the Danish government, arguing that this province was subject to Danish law.\n\nOtto von Bismarck used the turbulence to invade the duchies in a Second War of Schleswig. The rule of Denmark in the duchies was terminated, and Frederick triumphantly entered Kiel, where he was eagerly welcomed. However, numerous political complications arose which prevented the formal reinstatement of the dynasty. By the terms of the Treaty of Vienna (October, 1864), the duchies were relinquished to Prussia and Austria, to be disposed of by them. Prussia, however, imposed conditions upon Frederick which made it impossible for him to assume the government. After the Peace of Prague, which terminated the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the lands were finally absorbed into the Kingdom of Prussia.[1]\n\nFrederick subsequently served on the staff of the Crown Prince, Frederick William of Prussia, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71.[1] Frederick and his heirs continued to use their title, which after the next generation passed to the Glucksburg branch, to heirs of an elder brother of Christian IX of Denmark.\n\n## Marriage and children\n\n[edit]On September 11, 1856 Frederick married Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a German. She was the second daughter of Ernst Christian Carl IV, Duke of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Princess Feodora of Leiningen, elder half-sister of Queen Victoria. They were parents to seven children:\n\n- Prince\n*Friedrich*Wilhelm Victor Karl Ernst Christian August (August 3, 1857 \u2013 October 20, 1858). - Princess\n*Auguste Viktoria*Friederike Luise Feodora Jenny (October 22, 1858 \u2013 April 11, 1921).

Married Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg - Prince Friedrich Viktor Leopold Christian\n*Gerhard*(January 20, 1862 \u2013 April 11, 1862). - Ernst G\u00fcnther II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (August 11, 1863 \u2013 February 21, 1921).\n- Princess Feodora\n*Louise Sophie*Adelheid Henriette Amalie (April 8, 1866 \u2013 April 28, 1952). Married Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia. He was a male-line great-grandson of Frederick William III of Prussia. - Princess\n*Feodora Adelheid*Helene Luise Karoline Gustave Pauline Alice Jenny (July 3, 1874 \u2013 June 21, 1910).\n\n## Ancestry\n\n[edit]| Ancestors of Frederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\n\n## References\n\n[edit]### Citations\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b**Gilman, D.

During the 1850s and 1860s, he was a claimant to first duke of the whole provinces of Schleswig and Holstein, and a candidate to become king of Denmark following the death of King Frederick VII. He was the father-in-law of Princess Helena (daughter of Queen Victoria) and the paternal grandfather of Augusta Victoria, German Empress and wife of Kaiser Wilhelm II.\n\n## Family and lineage\n\n[edit]He was closely related to Kings Christian VII, Frederick VI and Christian VIII of Denmark through his mother and was a claimant for the Danish throne in the 1860s.\n\nBorn a prince of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and scion of a cadet-line descendant of the Danish royal House of Oldenburg, Christian August was the fiefholder of Augustenborg and S\u00f8nderborg. He was also a claimant to the rulership of the provinces of Sleswig and Holstein, and he was also a candidate to become king of Denmark during the succession crisis caused by the childlessness of King Frederick VII of Denmark. He lost the chance to ascend the throne to his distant kinsman, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck.\n\nChristian August was the eldest son and heir of Frederik Christian II, Duke of Augustenburg and his wife Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark. His father was the head of the senior cadet branch of the ruling house of Denmark, and thus the nearest agnatic kin of the kings of Denmark. Furthermore, his mother Louisa Auguste was (officially) the daughter of King Christian VII of Denmark, the sister of King Frederick VI and the first cousin of King Christian VIII. Due to all this, Christian August was high in the line of succession to the Danish throne. He also enjoyed additional influence in the Danish court because his sister, Caroline Amalie, was the beloved second wife of King Christian VIII (his mother's cousin).\n\nChristian August's family lost out in the competition for the throne of Denmark mainly because of the widely accepted belief that his mother was actually fathered by Johann Friedrich Struensee, Christian VII's royal physician. If true, this would mean Christian August was not a true legitimate descendant of Frederick III, the first hereditary monarch of Denmark. His claim was further weakened by having married for love to Countess Louise Sophie Danneskiold-Sams\u00f8e, a woman of unequal rank.\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]In 1848, German-nationalist sympathies prompted a rebellion in Schleswig-Holstein against Danish rule. A provisional government was established at Kiel under the Duke of Augustenborg, who travelled to Berlin to secure the assistance of Prussia in asserting his rights. The First War of Schleswig ensued.\n\nHowever, European powers were united in opposing any dismemberment of Denmark. Among others, Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, speaking with authority as Head of the elder Holstein-Gottorp line, regarded the Duke of Augustenborg a rebel. Russia had guaranteed Schleswig to the Danish crown by the treaties of 1767 and 1773.\n\nA treaty of peace between Prussia and Denmark was signed at Berlin on 2 July 1850. Both parties reserved their antecedent rights. Denmark was satisfied that the treaty empowered the king-duke to restore his authority in Holstein with or without the consent of the German Confederation. Augustenburg was ousted from power, as Danish troops marched in to subdue the duchies.\n\nThe question of the Augustenburg succession made an agreement between the major powers impossible, and on 31 March 1852 the duke of Augustenburg resigned his claim in return for a money payment. Duke Christian sold his rights to the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark in the aftermath of the Punctation of Olm\u00fctz, but later renounced his rights to the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein in favor of his son Frederik August.\n\nIn November 1863, his son Frederick proclaimed himself rightful second Duke of Schleswig and Holstein, following the death of Frederick VII of Denmark, the last King of Denmark who, by primogeniture, was also sovereign Duke of Schleswig and Holstein, but whose death extinguished the patriline of Denmark's hereditary Oldenburg kings. The resulting divergence of hereditary claims to the duchies eventually developed into the Second War of Schleswig.\n\nHe died in 1869.\n\n## Marriage and issue\n\n[edit]Christian married in 1820 his second cousin, Countess Lovisa-Sophie af Danneskjold-Sams\u00f8e (1796\u20131867), a Danish noblewoman who belonged to the House of Danneskiold-Sams\u00f8e, which in turn was an illegitimate branch of the Danish royal House of Oldenburg. They had seven children:\n\n- Prince\n*Alexander*Frederick William Christian Charles Augustus (20 July 1821 \u2013 3 May 1823), died young - Princess Louise Auguste (28 August 1823 \u2013 30 May 1872)\n- Princess Caroline Amelie (15 January 1826 \u2013 3 May 1901)\n- Princess Wilhelmine (24 March 1828 \u2013 4 July 1829), died young\n- Prince\n*Frederick*Christian August (6 July 1829 \u2013 14 January 1880), later Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. He married Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and had issue, including Augusta Viktoria \"Dona\", Empress of Germany as the wife of Kaiser Wilhelm II. - Frederick\n*Christian*Charles Augustus (22 January 1831 \u2013 28 October 1917), later (1866) married his third cousin Princess Helena of the United Kingdom (daughter of Queen Victoria) and settled in England. They were the parents of Albert, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein. - Princess Caroline Christiane Auguste Emilie\n*Henriette*Elisabeth (2 August 1833 \u2013 1917). She married Friedrich von Esmarch in 1872.\n\n## Place in Danish royal family and claim to throne\n\n[edit]| Family of Christian Augustus II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\n\n## Ancestry\n\n[edit]| Ancestors of Christian Augustus II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg |\n|---|\n\n## References\n\n[edit]### Bibliography\n\n[edit]- Johannes Heinrich Gebauer:\n*Christian August, Herzog von Schleswig Holstein.

Ospedale Valduce, Costa Masnaga, Italy\n\nBrain plasticity and functional reorganization are mechanisms behind functional motor recovery of patients after an ischemic stroke. The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger\u2019s causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nStroke is the second-leading cause of death and a major cause disability worldwide (Feigin, 2021) and, in particular, ischemic stroke constituted 62.4% of all new strokes in 2019. Focal stroke lesions affecting either cortical and sub-cortical neurons or descending fiber tracts may affect the neural processing in the motor network (Ward and Cohen, 2004; Stinear et al., 2007). This leads to motor deficit, mainly caused by hemiparesis, that is one of the most common stroke-related disabilities (Katan and Luft, 2018). Nevertheless, it has been observed that patients with initially mild to moderate motor impairments may show substantial recovery of the motor function within the first 3 months after stroke onset. This may be driven by neural plasticity and reorganization, which can occur in the brain also far from the lesion site (Nudo, 2006; Cramer, 2008; Rehme and Grefkes, 2013).\n\nTo investigate cortical functional reorganization, connectivity models based on the concept that the brain is organized in specialized anatomically distinct areas functionally integrated in networks (Friston, 2002) were applied to neuroimaging techniques, both in experimental and computational simulation studies (Falcon et al., 2016; Allegra Mascaro et al., 2020). Functional connectivity is usually inferred by means of correlations among measurements of neuronal activity neglecting information on the coupling direction, whereas the directed functional connectivity investigates the causal influence that a brain region exerts over another (Friston, 2011; Barrett and Barnett, 2013). In the literature, the analysis of cortical directed and undirected functional connectivity has been extensively used to characterize the brain connections and investigate rehabilitation effects on patients after stroke events (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Connectivity studies can be carried out during both task and resting state conditions, the latter being the easiest protocol executable also for patients in the acute stage. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that changes in resting state connectivity, especially in the motor network, are predictive of motor function recovery in stroke patients (James et al., 2009; Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Volz et al., 2016; Hordacre et al., 2020).\n\nAmong neuroimaging techniques, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was one of the first employed to investigate brain connectivity. Given its high spatial resolution and the provided volumetric information, fMRI allows investigation of connections involving both cortical and deep structures in the brain (Farr and Wegener, 2010). Electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed as a valid alternative technique, as it allowed to reconstruct known resting state networks from signals acquired by scalp electrodes in healthy subjects (Mantini et al., 2007). Despite its lower spatial resolution, EEG offers a higher time resolution with respect to fMRI, allowing to better track the fast reconfiguration of neuronal networks and to extract information on the spectral characteristics of the functional networks related to specific brain rhythms. Moreover, it exploits cheaper and portable instrumentation, allowing measurements both on healthy and pathological subjects, also accessible in complex medical setting (Borich et al., 2015).\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, a plethora of measures and indexes have been proposed to infer both functional and causal connectivity from EEG recordings (Pereda et al., 2005), including bivariate and conditional Granger causality (GC), transfer entropy (TE), directed transfer function (DTF), directed coherence (DC), partial directed coherence (PDC) and dynamical Bayesian inference. Each of these metrics may be sensitive to different aspects of the neurophysiological data, evidenced either in time or frequency domains or through linear or non-linear relationships. Therefore, the choice of a metric over another depends on the particular aspect of interest in the connectivity network; moreover, the reliability of a specific metric can depend on different factors related to the specific application, such as the stationarity of the signal, non-linear effects or indirect connections among networks nodes. Different causal connectivity metrics can lead to different results and careful interpretation is required. Usually, only one metric is chosen to retrieve networks\u2019 topology and infer the spectral content of the information flow between network nodes. However, the use of a single metric cannot guarantee a comprehensive description of the network (Blinowska, 2011). For instance, GC and TE provide compact information on the overall information flow between network nodes, while DTF, DC and PDC focus on specific rhythms of physiological interest (Sameshima and Baccal\u00e1, 2014; Seth et al., 2015); bivariate GC\/TE and DC detect the overall flow of information from one node to another, while conditional GC\/TE and DTF\/PDC elicit direct connections but may lose ability to capture the coupling strength (Faes et al., 2012). Finally, the dynamical Bayesian inference approach has been proposed to assess the cross-frequency coupling strength both in neural networks and among different physiological systems, e.g., cardio-respiratory-cortical interactions (Stankovski et al., 2016). Until now, an agreed standard measure to assess EEG-based causal connectivity is not univocally employed in the literature, and the selection of the most appropriate measure still represents an open issue.\n\nMoreover, in the context of EEG analysis, causal connectivity was often identified directly from the electrodes signal, but it has been demonstrated that connectivity computed in the electrode space is affected by the scalp volume-conduction effect and the obtained results can be hardly interpreted as real brain connectivity (Hassan and Wendling, 2018; Marinazzo et al., 2019; Van de Steen et al., 2019). On the contrary, meaningful connectivity patterns can be derived from cortical source activities extracted from EEG inverse solutions (Michel and Murray, 2012; Haufe et al., 2013).\n\nAlthough the effects of stroke on resting-state brain connectivity have been widely investigated, especially in the acute phase with respect to healthy subjects, a limited number of works focused specifically on longitudinal effects of motor rehabilitation on the reorganization of the cortical motor network after stroke. Moreover, the majority of studies exploited fMRI to assess functional, non-directed connectivity (Desowska and Turner, 2019). Considering EEG analysis, up to now, the majority of studies explored functional connectivity in post-stroke populations in both acute (Caliandro et al., 2017; Vecchio et al., 2019a, 2019b; Fanciullacci et al., 2021; Hoshino et al., 2021) and chronic stages (Gerloff et al., 2006; De Vico Fallani et al., 2009, 2017; Wu et al., 2015; Hordacre et al., 2020; Molteni et al., 2020; Waterstone et al., 2020; Romeo et al., 2021); only fewer studies investigated the resting-state causal connectivity after stroke (Guo et al., 2014; Pichiorri et al., 2015, 2018; Calabr\u00f2 et al., 2018; Nicolo et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021). The few studies cited above employing EEG rarely focused on the investigation of the motor network, preferring a large-scale connectivity analysis of the whole brain with synthetic descriptors. Even though this type of information can serve as a general indication on the state of brain\u2019s connections after stroke, information about power spectral strength or flow direction in the identified connections are often missing. This type of information can be obtained by separate connectivity metrics computed from electrodes or brain sources signals and whose underlying interpretation should be carefully considered to compare the results between different studies.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, the investigation of motor network directed functional connectivity by means of EEG in sub-acute stroke patients should be deepened from both methodological and application perspectives. To this aim, in this work we perform an EEG-based longitudinal study of resting-state causal connectivity in a population of sub-acute stroke patients with motor impairment who underwent a rehabilitation treatment. We focus on the characterization of the motor network exploiting the cortical source signals reconstructed from EEG scalp recordings and using two different connectivity metrics, i.e., the Directed Coherence (DC) and the generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Combining the information carried by these two measures, we aim to provide a description of the variations induced by treatment in both the topography and the transfer of spectral power along the identified functional connections, investigating also possible correlations with the clinical assessment of motor recovery.\n\nIn Section 2, a detailed description of the participants enrolled for this study and the methodology followed is presented. In Section 3, the obtained results are reported and their discussion can be found in Section 4. Section 5 draws conclusions of the work.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1 Population Description\n\nEighteen subjects (age 67 \u00b1 10, seven females and 11 males) in the sub-acute stage after ischemic stroke were enrolled for this study. Inclusion criteria were age less than 80 years old, first unilateral stroke, distance from acute event less than 30 days, with no other concomitant orthopedic or rheumatologic disease, without global or comprehension aphasia, right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. Each subject was evaluated twice: firstly, at the admission to the rehabilitation center (T0, on average after 12 \u00b1 5 days from the stroke event) and secondly at the end of the rehabilitation treatment (T1, on average after 55 \u00b1 11 days from the event). In Table 1, details about participants\u2019 characteristics are reported. To participate, each subject signed a written informed consent. The study was reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee \u201cComitato Etico Provinciale dell\u2019Insubria\u201d and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nPatients followed a rehabilitation treatment for both upper and lower limb recovery: each patient underwent to a rehabilitation treatment twice per day, each session lasting 45 min. Training was tailored according to patients\u2019 residuals motor capacity and it included exercise for upper and lower limbs. Lower and upper limbs stretching, lower and upper limbs muscle strengthening, static and dynamic balance exercises, proprioception exercises, trunk control exercise, gait at the parallel bars or in clinical open spaces were the exercise performed.\n\n### 2.2 Functional Assessment\n\nClinical evaluations were performed by clinicians, i.e., physiotherapist and medical doctor. To assess the upper limb performance the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) (Fugl-Meyer et al., 1975) before and after treatment was used. The FMA motor score ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 66 (upper limb normal motor performance). As for the lower limb, the level of walking ability was assessed by the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC). This gait assessment scale distinguishes six levels of walking ability based on the amount of physical support required. The lowest level 0 indicates a patient who is not able to walk, while level 5, indicates a patient who can walk everywhere independently, including stairs (Holden et al., 1984). Participants\u2019 scores assigned at T0 and T1 for both clinical scales, i.e., FMAT0, FMAT1, FAC T0 and FAC T1, are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe variations \u0394FMA = FMAT1\u2013FMAT0 and \u0394FAC = FACT1\u2013FACT0 was considered as primary clinical outcomes of subject\u2019s motor recovery.\n\n### 2.3 EEG Data Acquisition\n\nResting state EEG recordings were performed with the Neuroscan system (Compumedics Neuroscan, Compumedics, NC, United States) using 64 Ag\/AgCl electrodes placed according to the International 10\/20 standard system. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz, with the reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz positions and the ground electrode positioned anterior to Fz. During the acquisition, patients were asked to keep their eyes closed in a sitting relaxed position for at least 5 min. As for functional assessment, EEG recordings were repeated twice, before (T0) and after (T1) the rehabilitation treatment.\n\n### 2.4 EEG Data Analysis\n\nIn Figure 1, a scheme of the principal steps followed for the analysis of single EEG recordings is reported. Three main stages can be identified: EEG signal pre-processing, current sources reconstruction and directed functional connectivity. In the scheme, inputs and outputs of each block are highlighted. Detailed explanation of each step is provided in the following sections.\n\n**FIGURE 1**. Pipeline of single acquisition and analysis. Abbreviations: MVAR, multivariate auto-regressive; DC, Directed Coherence; gPDC, generalized partial directed coherence.\n\n##### 2.4.1 EEG Pre-Processing\n\nEEG signals were pre-processed offline in Matlab environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) using the open source EEGLab signal processing Toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).\n\nData were down-sampled at 128 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 45 Hz to remove slow drifts and high-frequency components, such as the power line noise. Flat and \u201cbad\u201d channels were removed for further analysis. A flat channel was identified if it showed amplitude around zero (flatline) for more than 5 s consecutively, whereas a channel was identified as \u201cbad\u201d if it was noisy for more than 90% of the acquisition duration. An Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm (Mullen et al., 2015) was applied to all retained channels to identify and remove transient or high-amplitude artifacts, e.g., eye movements. According to Chang and others (Chang et al., 2020), the application of this cleaning approach improves the accuracy of subsequent Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The ASR algorithm automatically identifies clean periods of the EEG data using a sliding window. An artifact rejection threshold is calculated, based on the calibration signal distribution of variance and a user-defined cut-off parameter. Data portions, whose variance is larger than this threshold, are removed and reconstructed from neighboring channels using a covariance matrix computed from the calibration data. According to the cut-off parameter *k* chosen by the user, the method can be more or less aggressive in removing EEG components portions of data. In this work, *k* = 20 was employed, according to the range suggested by Chang and others, who validated the ASR method on real EEG data and found that a *k* in the range 10\u2013100 allows removing ocular artifacts still preserving cerebral components (Chang et al., 2020). Furthermore, ICA was applied to the ASR-cleaned EEG recordings exploiting the RUNICA Infomax algorithm as implemented in EEGLab (Makeig and Bell, 1996). RUNICA un-mixes the EEG recordings in cortical and non-cortical spatially distinct and temporally independent components (IC). Once the non-cortical components are identified and removed, the final cleaned EEG signal can be reconstructed. To guide the selection of ICs accounting for non-brain (artifactual) activities the ICLabel plugin was employed (Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019). It is an automated classifier which provides an estimation of the type of each of the IC (brain, eye, muscle, line noise, etc.) based on some component characteristics, i.e., power spectrum, its time-course, topography dipole localization and percentage data variance accounted in the considered component. A final visual check of the signals was performed. The originally removed \u201cbad\u201d channels were then reconstructed by the interpolation of the neighbor channels signals, thus obtaining a uniform EEG spatial sampling. Finally, EEG data were re-referenced to a common average reference and 1 min of cleaned, artifact-free 60 channels EEG was selected for all subjects.\n\n##### 2.4.2 Individual Alpha Frequency\n\nTo improve the accuracy of the EEG analysis in the frequency domain, the interindividual variability of the alpha rhythm peak was considered for the determination of the spectral bands of interest, as proposed by Klimesch in 1999 (Klimesch, 1999). In particular, for the purpose of this study, we focused our analysis on alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands, which are reported as the most involved in motor system functions (Pfurtscheller et al., 1994, 1996). After computing the power spectral density (PSD) for the parieto-occipital channels by the Welch method (Welch, 1967), the Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF) was determined as the average peak position in the spectral range 7.5\u201312.5 Hz. The average IAF found in our population was equal to 9.07 \u00b1 0.99 Hz. The IAF was used to define the alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) frequency bands as follow: \u03b1 = [IAF-2 Hz \u00f7 IAF+2 Hz] and \u03b2 = [IAF+2.5 Hz \u00f7 IA\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_7DYg86cSat7GoN0cWU63Pxk3\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35450158\/\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Open Result 0\n# Resting State EEG Directed Functional Connectivity Unveils Changes in Motor Network Organization in Subacute Stroke Patients After Rehabilitation\n\n-\nPMID:\n**35450158** - PMCID: PMC9016279\n- DOI: 10.3389\/fphys.2022.862207\n\n# Resting State EEG Directed Functional Connectivity Unveils Changes in Motor Network Organization in Subacute Stroke Patients After Rehabilitation\n\n## Abstract\n\nBrain plasticity and functional reorganization are mechanisms behind functional motor recovery of patients after an ischemic stroke. The study of resting-state motor network functional connectivity by means of EEG proved to be useful in investigating changes occurring in the information flow and find correlation with motor function recovery. In the literature, most studies applying EEG to post-stroke patients investigated the undirected functional connectivity of interacting brain regions. Quite recently, works started to investigate the directionality of the connections and many approaches or features have been proposed, each of them being more suitable to describe different aspects, e.g., direct or indirect information flow between network nodes, the coupling strength or its characteristic oscillation frequency. Each work chose one specific measure, despite in literature there is not an agreed consensus, and the selection of the most appropriate measure is still an open issue. In an attempt to shed light on this methodological aspect, we propose here to combine the information of direct and indirect coupling provided by two frequency-domain measures based on Granger's causality, i.e., the directed coherence (DC) and the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), to investigate the longitudinal changes of resting-state directed connectivity associated with sensorimotor rhythms \u03b1 and \u03b2, occurring in 18 sub-acute ischemic stroke patients who followed a rehabilitation treatment. Our results showed a relevant role of the information flow through the pre-motor regions in the reorganization of the motor network after the rehabilitation in the sub-acute stage. In particular, DC highlighted an increase in intra-hemispheric coupling strength between pre-motor and primary motor areas, especially in ipsi-lesional hemisphere in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands, whereas gPDC was more sensitive in the detection of those connection whose variation was mostly represented within the population. A decreased causal flow from contra-lesional premotor cortex towards supplementary motor area was detected in both \u03b1 and \u03b2 frequency bands and a significant reinforced inter-hemispheric connection from ipsi to contra-lesional pre-motor cortex was observed in \u03b2 frequency. Interestingly, the connection from contra towards ipsilesional pre-motor area correlated with upper limb motor recovery in \u03b1 band. The usage of two different measures of directed connectivity allowed a better comprehension of those coupling changes between brain motor regions, either direct or mediated, which mostly were influenced by the rehabilitation, revealing a particular involvement of the pre-motor areas in the cerebral functional reorganization.\n\n**\nKeywords:\n**\nEEG; brain sources; causal connectivity; directed coherence; motor network; partial direct coherence; stroke; subacute.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Pirovano, Mastropietro, Antonacci, Bar\u00e0, Guanziroli, Molteni, Faes and Rizzo.\n\n## Conflict of interest statement\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n## Figures\n\n## References\n\n-\n- Allegra Mascaro A.

In 2010, the index crossed 8500 points and finally crashed in the first quarter of 2011. Millions of investors lost their money and came out onto the street, blaming the speculators and regulators for the bubble that finally burst in what became known as the 2011 Bangladesh share market scam. Currently, there are 22 industrial sectors in DSE which accommodate 625 listed companies. In January 2023, DSE and Nasdaq announced their partnership with trading technology.[6] However, no new companies were approved for IPOs in 2024, underscoring the market's paralysis. Well-performing family-owned businesses are reluctant to list, fearing regulatory scrutiny and governance reforms that threaten their traditional control. As a result, Bangladesh\u2019s market capitalization has stagnated at around 20% of GDP.[7]\n\n## Formation\n\n[edit]Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) is a public limited company.

It was suggested that Dhaka Narayanganj Chamber of Commerce and Industry should approach its members for purchase of membership cards at Rs 2000 each for the proposed Stock Exchange. The 8 promoters incorporated the formation as the East Pakistan Stock Exchange Association Ltd on 28th April, 1954 as Public Company.

It was renamed as East Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd on 23 June 1962. It was again renamed as Dacca Stock Exchange Ltd on 13 May 1964. After 1971 the trading was discontinued for five years. In 1976 trading restarted in Bangladesh, and DSE was started on 16 September 1986. The formula for calculating DSE all share price index was changed according to IFC on 1 November 1993. Automated trading was initiated on 10 August 1998 and started on 1 January 2001. A central securities depository system was initiated on 24 January 2004.\n\nAs of 16 November 2009, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) crossed 4000 points for the first time, setting a new high at 4148 points. In 2010, the index crossed 8500 points and finally crashed in the first quarter of 2011. Millions of investors lost their money and came out onto the street, blaming the speculators and regulators for the bubble that finally burst in what became known as the 2011 Bangladesh share market scam. Currently, there are 22 industrial sectors in DSE which accommodate 625 listed companies. In January 2023, DSE and Nasdaq announced their partnership with trading technology.[6] However, no new companies were approved for IPOs in 2024, underscoring the market's paralysis. Well-performing family-owned businesses are reluctant to list, fearing regulatory scrutiny and governance reforms that threaten their traditional control. As a result, Bangladesh\u2019s market capitalization has stagnated at around 20% of GDP.[7]\n\n## Formation\n\n[edit]Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) is a public limited company. It is formed and managed under Company Act 1994, Security and Exchange Commission Act 1993, Security and Exchange Commission Regulation 1994, and Security Exchange (Inside Trading) regulation 1994. The issued capital of this company is Tk. 500,000, which is divided up to 250 shares each pricing Tk. 2000. No individual or firm can buy more than one share. According to the stock market rule, only members can participate on the floor and buy shares for themselves or their clients. At present, it has 238 members. The market capitalization of the Dhaka Stock Exchange reached nearly $9 billion in September 2007 and $27.4 billion on 9 December 2009.\n\n## Management\n\n[edit]The management and operation of Dhaka Stock Exchange is entrusted to a 25 members board of directors. Among them, 12 are elected from DSE members, another 12 are selected from different trade bodies and relevant organisations. The CEO is the 25th *ex officio* member of the board. The government has appointed Shibli Rubayat Ul Islam, who teaches banking and insurance at Dhaka University, as the chairman of Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, reports bdnews24.com.\n\nThe following organisations are currently holding positions in DSE Board:\n\n- Bangladesh Bank\n- ICB \u2013 Investment Corporation of Bangladesh\n- President of Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh\n- President of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI)\n- President of Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dhaka and Industries\n- Professor of Finance Department of Dhaka University\n- President of Dhaka Chamber of Commerce & Industry (DCCI).\n\n## Trading hours\n\n[edit]The Dhaka Stock Exchange is open for trading Sunday through Thursday between 10:00 am \u2013 2:30 pm BST, except for holidays declared by the exchange in advance. In the month of Ramadan, the exchange is open for trading between 10:00 am \u2013 2:00 pm BST.\n\nThere are a total of 651 Securities[8] and 397 companies[2] listed on this Stock exchange. The listing provides an exclusive privilege to securities in the stock exchange. Only listed shares are quoted on the stock exchange. A stock exchange facilitates transparency in transactions of listed securities in perfect equality and competitive conditions. Listing is beneficial to the company, to the investor, and to the public at large.\n\nThe trading indices are DSE Broad Index (DSEX), DSE Shariah Index (DSES), DSE 30 Index (DS30), CDSET.\n\n## 2010\u201311 crash\n\n[edit]The bullish market turned bearish during November 2010, with the exchange losing 1,800 points between December 2010 and January 2011.[9] Millions of investors have been rendered bankrupt as a result of the market crash. The crash is believed to be caused artificially to benefit a handful of players at the expense of the big players.[9]\n\n## List of chairpersons\n\n[edit]| Sn. | Name | Term Starts | Term Ends | References |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Ahmad Fazlur Rahman | 1972 | 1975 | Past Chairmans of Dhaka Stock Exchange\".[10]\n|\n| 2 | Khurshid Alam | 27 February 1976 | 6 August 1979 | |\n| 3 | Nur-E-Alam Siddique | 6 August 1979 | 6 November 1980 | |\n| 4 | Khwaja Abdul Quddus | 6 November 1980 | 18 March 1981 | |\n| 5 | Nur-E-Alam Siddique | 18 March 1981 | 22 December 1981 | |\n| 6 | Khwaja Abdul Quddus | 22 December 1981 | 24 March 1983 | |\n| 7 | Khurshid Alam | 24 March 1983 | 18 December 1985 | |\n| 8 | Hemayet Uddin Ahmed | 18 December 1985 | 6 January 1987 | |\n| 9 | Kazi Firoz Rashid | 6 January 1987 | 23 March 1990 | |\n| 10 | Khwaja Abdul Quddus | 23 March 1990 | 20 Jun 1991 | |\n| 11 | Aminul Islam Khan | 20 Jun 1991 | 7 October 1993 | |\n| 12 | Khurshid Alam | 7 October 1993 | 6 December 1995 | |\n| 13 | Imtiyaz Husain | 6 December 1995 | 11 May 1997 | |\n| 14 | M.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE)? The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), located in the Motijheel Park area of Dhaka, is one of two financial marketplaces in Bangladesh. The other is the Chittagong Stock Exchange. The DSE was incorporated in 1954 and began formal trading in 1956. Understanding the Dhaka Stock Exchange The Dhaka Stock Exchange endeavors to be the leading exchange in its region and a key driver of economic growth. As such, the DSE is proactive about keeping pace with technological advancements. The DSE initiated automated trading in 1998, and installed a central securities depository system in 2004. Since its inception, the Dhaka Stock Exchange has aspired to compete on the world stage of financial markets. It is cognizant of what it must do to persevere toward this goal and has set an ambitious schedule of objectives that it aims to fulfill in coming years, which include the following: Attracting more foreign investors in order to attain a steady level of at least 30% total market cap Achieving a sustainable average daily turnover of BDT 25 billion Ensuring steady domestic and offshore institutional investments of at least three-quarters of its total investments Enhancing its offerings by listing government municipal (munis), and corporate bonds Doubling its number of listed individual company securities Increasing its scope to offer index futures, exchange traded funds (ETFs), and derivatives Advancing its technology to enable global trading and settlement The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE): Background Originally, the DSE was called the East Pakistan Stock Exchange Association Ltd. In 1962, the name was revised to East Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd., and two years later, the name again changed to the current, Dhaka Stock Exchange Ltd. The Dhaka Stock Exchange is registered as a Public Limited Company (PLC) and is regulated by the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Ordinance of 1969, the Companies Act of 1994 (Bangladesh) and the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Act of 1993, which established oversight for the Dhaka Stock Exchange. As with the SEC in the United States, the Bangladesh SEC's responsibilities are broadly \"to protect the interest of investors in securities, develop the securities markets, and formulate rules on securities related matters.\" The Dhaka Stock Exchange trades in Bangladeshi taka, which is the currency of Bangladesh, and whose official International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 currency code is BDT. The taka was issued in 1972, replacing the Pakistani rupee at a ratio of one to one. Companies listed on the DSE are based primarily in Bangladesh. As of Oct. 13, 2021, the DSE\u2019s market capitalization in adjusted U.S. dollars was $67.11 billion. Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

It is a crossing of the Rio Grande that connects the cities of Rio Grande City, Texas and Camargo, Tamaulipas. The bridge is also known as the **Starr \u2013 Camargo Bridge** and, in Spanish, **Puente Camargo**. It is the southern terminus of Farm to Market Road 755.[1]\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]The two-lane steel girder bridge, which was completed and opened in 1966, is 591 feet (180 m) long. The bridge is owned and managed by the Starr Camargo Bridge Company based in Rio Grande City.[1]\n\nOn the U.S. side, the crossing connects with Pete Diaz Avenue and Bridge Avenue, which provides access to U.S. Route 83.[2] On the Mexican side the bridge connects with Carr Al Puente Internacional to Ciudad Camargo. Truckloads are restricted to 60 short tons (54,000 kg).\n\n## Border crossing\n\n[edit]The Rio Grande City Port of Entry is located at the Rio Grande City \u2013 Camargo International Bridge.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, a small ferry operation connected the cities of Camargo and Rio Grande City. Finally in 1966, a bridge was built by the Starr Camargo Bridge Company.[3] and a new border inspection station was built at that time. The station was upgraded in 2000.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a**\"Rio Grande City-Camargo Bridge\". Texas Department of Transportation.

It is located on the US border, across from Rio Grande City, Texas. It has an official population of 14,933 inhabitants (2010 census). The municipal seat is Ciudad Camargo, with a population of 7,984. The municipality is connected to Rio Grande City, Texas, via the Rio Grande City-Camargo International Bridge.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]The first settlement to be founded on the Lower R\u00edo Grande was that of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Santa Ana de Camargo. It was founded on March 5, 1749, with the dedication to Se\u00f1ora Santa Ana by captain Don Blas Mar\u00eda de la Garza Falc\u00f3n at the eastern edge of the San Juan River near its confluence with the R\u00edo Grande. The foundation had 85 families \u2013 a total of 531 persons. Most of the settlers for this township came from Cerralvo, Cadereyta, Monterrey and surrounding townships.\n\nAfter establishing other towns in the interior of Mexico between Quer\u00e9taro[ citation needed] and the Gulf coast, Jos\u00e9 de Escand\u00f3n arrived at Camargo on March 3, 1749. At the location called, \"Paso del Azucar\" on the Rio Grande, about two leagues southeast of the present site of Camargo, he met Captain Blas Maria de la Garza Falc\u00f3n who already had been encamped there with forty other families and some soldiers. In the group led by Captain Blas Maria de la Garza Falcon were Miguel de la Garza Falcon, his brother, and Nicolas de los Santos Coy, father-in-law of Captain Falcon and ex-alcalde of nearby Cerralvo Municipality in Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\n\nThese settlers were men of wealth who felt a need to risk all for greater gain. The town had already been laid out on the eastern bank of the San Juan River, not far from the Rio Grande, and temporary shelters made, jacales (straw huts). Father Fray Hierro, who had joined Escandon at Padilla and was a missionary from the college of Zacatecas, kept a diary which provides many interesting details concerning the establishment of the first settlements of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Fourteen settlements were established in a six months period.\n\nThe settlers of this town were, as is evident from the captain's registry, generally Spaniards; they came in with some major and minor livestock: goats, sheep and mules.\n\nA great flood in the year 1751 did some damage to the settlement, for which reason it was moved a little farther down the river to a higher site. An irrigation canal which had been built at the original location, because of their not having trimmed the opening to the canal with stone and mortar, was destroyed by the flood.\n\nFollowing Texan independence and the commencement of the Mexican\u2013American War, Camargo was occupied by the US army under the command of General Zachary Taylor on 14 July 1846. This river port served as a jumping off point for the invasion on Monterrey and Saltillo. The US Army was transported via steamboats from the mouth of the river area and Matamoros. Disease plagued the troops and it is said that thousand of US soldiers were buried here in unmarked graves.\n\nOn January 22, 2021, nineteen burned bodies were found in Camargo Municipality, likely victims of drug violence.[1] As of February 3, two of the deceased were identified as Mexicans and two as Guatemalans, and twelve police officers were arrested.[2] Sixteen of the bodies were identified as Guatemalan migrants and were returned to their country of origin in February 2021.[3]\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]### Towns and villages\n\n[edit]The largest localities (cities, towns, and villages) are:[4]\n\nName |\n2010 Census Population\n|\n|---|---|\n| Ciudad Camargo 26\u00b018\u203256\u2033N 98\u00b050\u203200\u2033W \/ 26.31556\u00b0N 98.83333\u00b0W | 7,984 |\n| Comales 26\u00b010\u203256\u2033N 98\u00b055\u203214\u2033W \/ 26.18222\u00b0N 98.92056\u00b0W | 2,429 |\n| Nuevo Camargo | 907 |\n| Nuevo Camargo (Villanueva) | 420 |\n| Rancher\u00edas | 404 |\n| San Francisco | 384 |\n| Guardados de Abajo | 326 |\n| L\u00f3pez y Nuevo Cadillo | 319 |\n| Santa Rosal\u00eda | 229 |\nTotal Municipality |\n14,933\n|\n\n### Adjacent municipalities and counties\n\n[edit]- Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz Municipality - southeast\n- General Bravo Municipality, Nuevo Le\u00f3n - southeast\n- Doctor Coss Municipality, Nuevo Le\u00f3n - southwest\n- Miguel Alem\u00e1n Municipality - northwest\n- Starr County, Texas - north\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"19 burned bodies found near Mexico-US border town\".*AP NEWS*. 24 January 2021.

These refugees were assimilated into the Xhosa nation and were officially recognized by the then king, Hintsa.\n\n[1]\n\nThe word Fengu comes from the old Xhosa word which is \"ukumfenguza\" which in the old Xhosa dialect meant to wander.\n\nThe Fengu people are of a confederation of clans from the Natal province near the Embo river, these clans include Miya, Ndlangisa, Gatyeni, Bhele, Tolo and Tshezi clans.\n\nDuring the 6th Frontier War, they were promised independence from the oppressive Xhosa government by the Cape Colony and it was proposed that they would be given their own land which would be called Fingoland, the southwestern portion of Eastern Xhosaland, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.[2]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Formation and early history\n\n[edit]The name *amaMfengu* does not translate as \"wanderers\" as many believe and the Mfengu people \u2013 like the Bhaca, Bhele, Hlubi and Dlamini peoples \u2013 was formed from the tribes that were broken up and dispersed by Shaka and his Zulu armies in the Mfecane wars.\n\nMost of them fled westwards and settled amongst the Xhosa. After some years of oppression by the Gcaleka Xhosa (who called the Fengu people their \"dogs\")[ citation needed]in the 1820s, they formed an alliance with the Cape government in 1835 and Sir Benjamin d'Urban invited 17,000 to settle on the banks of the Great Fish River in the region that later became known as the Ciskei.\n\n[3]Some scholars, including Timothy Stapleton and Alan Webster, argue that the traditional narrative of the Fengu people as refugees of the Mfecane is in fact a lie constructed by colonial missionaries and administrators. They question the existence of the Fengu people as a distinct group prior to colonial contact, instead positing that the term was coined by the British government in the Cape Colony to describe a collection of Xhosa defectors, migrant laborers, and labor captives.\n\n[4]\n\n### Early frontier wars (1835\u201356)\n\n[edit]They subsequently became notable allies of the Cape Colony in the frontier wars against their former oppressors. In this capacity, they won several victories against their Xhosa enemies (particularly the Gcaleka Xhosa), and through shrewd and successful management of regional trade, formed a developed and materially successful nation. In addition, many bought farms and started businesses in the small towns that were springing up in that part of the Cape frontier.\n\n### The Cattle-killing movement (1856\u201358)\n\n[edit]The Fengu people did not take part in the great cattle-killing in 1857, which devastated the Xhosa people.\n\nWhile the Xhosa slaughtered their own cattle and burnt their crops, many of the Fengu people instead bought the Xhosa cattle at very low prices, only to resell them at a profit during the subsequent famine. They also were recorded as producing large excesses of grain at this time for their starving neighbours. The famine induced by the cattle-killing effectively brought much of the armed resistance in the eastern Cape to an end.\n\n### The Fengu-Gcaleka War (1877\u201379)\n\n[edit]Over a decade of relative peace and economic development, which peaked in the mid-1870s, was brought to an end by a series of devastating droughts across the Transkei, which began to place severe strain on intertribal relations. Their severity increased up until 1877, when the last major war that the Fengu people fought, the Ninth Frontier War, broke out after a bar fight between Fengu and Gcaleka guests, at a Fengu wedding. Many Fengu people were Cape citizens by this time, so the Cape Colony took a partisan view of the war, which brought it into conflict with the Gcaleka forces.[5][6][7]\n\nThe Cape government appointed the Fengu Captain Bikitsha to co-lead the Cape's forces (composed primarily of Fengu, Thembu and Boer commandos) in the war. They inflicted a string of crushing defeats on the enemy and dispersed their armies in the space of only three weeks. The ingratitude of Cape Colony governor Sir Henry Bartle Frere, who promptly humiliated the Cape's Fengu allies by forcibly disarming them, caused the Fengu to begin to identify more with the Xhosa, partly also as a reaction to increasing persecution from the Colonial authorities.\n\n### Transkei and Ciskei\n\n[edit]The Fengu lived in the Bantustans of Transkei and Ciskei, established by the Apartheid government. Ciskei was the scene of political rivalry between the Rharhabe and the Fengu as a result of the apartheid policy of \"retribalisation\", which resulted in resentment toward the historically better educated, and relatively economically advantaged Fengu, and this rivalry culminated in the election of Lennox Sebe, a Rharhabe, who replaced Fengu leader Chief Justice Thandathu Jongilizwe Mabandla in 1973,[8] however Sebe subsequently abandoned his anti-Fengu rhetoric.[8]: 402\n\n## Christianity in the Fengu community\n\n[edit]Christianity played a major role in the survival of the endangered Fengu people after the Mfecane wars. After contact with the Gcaleka Xhosa, who were hostile towards them, the Fengu people found comfort in Rev. John Ayliff, the missionary at Butterworth who devoted himself to the tribe for the next 30 years. In 1835, Ayliff led 17 000 and 22 000 head of cattle to Peddie[9] On 14 May 1835, the Fengu people gathered under an old milkwood tree in the Peddie district, in the presence of Rev. John Ayliff, and swore an oath to obey the Queen, to accept Christianity, and to educate their children. This agreement became known as the 'Fingo-Oath'. Soon after accepting Christianity, the Fengu became the first Bantu in South Africa to use ploughs, demonstrated to them by the missionaries, and also the first to plant wheat.[10] A small group moved to Tsitsikamma and carried their Christian customs with them. The Fengu, who were most Wesleyans, soon moved to Grahamstown where they fought on the side of the British in the eighth frontier war of 1850 to 1853 and were rewarded with land in a freehold village known as Fingo in Grahamstown in 1855.[11] The educated Fengu went as far as Port Elizabeth, where they worked at the harbour and established urban communities in Cape Town, where they also continued practising as Christians. Since the day the 'Fingo-Oath' was sworn, 14 May has been celebrated as Fingo Emancipation Day and a ceremony held under the old milkwood tree where the oath was sworn.[10]\n\n## Fengu people in Zimbabwe\n\n[edit]After the occupation of Matebeleland in 1893, the Ndebele took up arms in an effort to re-establish the Ndebele State in 1896. Cecil John Rhodes brought a group of Fengu fighters (who had fought on the side of the British) and were known as \"the Cape Boys\" in 1896. After the war, Rhodes tried further to 'neutralise' the 'war-like' Ndebele people by inviting more Fengu people into Southern Rhodesia. \"He promised the Fengus three 'reserves' on which they could settle with the proviso that each man would work for three months a year. After 36 months of labour, each one would be given an individual title\".[12] More Fengu leaders moved to Southern Rhodesia as Wesleyan Methodists, Salvationists, Anglicans, Presbyterians and Lutherans. In 2000, the Mbembesi Fengu\/Xhosa community celebrated their centenary in Zimbabwe.[12] The Fengu in Zimbabwe, who are Xhosa speakers, are the subject of the first ever PHD thesis written in Xhosa by Dr Hleze Kunju titled IsiXhosa ulwimi lwabantu abangesosininzi eZimbabwe: Ukuphila nokulondolozwa kwaso (Xhosa as a Minority Language in Zimbabwe: Survival and Maintenance)[13]\n\n### Veldtman Bikitsha (1829\u20131912)\n\n[edit]For much of the 19th and early 20th century, the Fengu were led by Captain Veldtman Bikitsha. Initially a constable who was of great service to the Cape in the 8th Frontier War, he was later promoted and served as a de facto military leader of the Cape's Fengu commandos.\n\nPrime Minister John Molteno, who held a very high opinion of Bikitsha, appointed him as a leader of the Cape forces (together with Chief Magistrate Charles Griffith) in the 9th Frontier War in 1877, where he swiftly won a string of brilliant victories against the Gcaleka. Throughout the 9th Frontier war, Bikitsha and his location were a focal point for the Gcaleka armies attacks and came under immense military pressure.\n\nHis military genius in the frontier wars earned him considerable renown and he was widely acknowledged leader in the Cape Colony. His courage was also frequently referred to. He famously once jumped onto a wounded and charging lion, holding it by the tail, overpowered it and killed it. He was invited to London in 1889, where Queen Victoria requested to meet him to thank him for his services. He reputedly told her *\"We have never feared a white man, and we have never lifted our hand against any of your people.\"*\n\nHe founded the Transkei General Council, and served as a juror and commissioner for the Cape Colony in later life[14]\n\n### John Tengo Jabavu (1859\u20131921)\n\n[edit]As Fengu history switched from military defense to political struggle, so the great Fengu politician and activist John Tengo Jabavu rose in prominence after Bikitsha's military leadership ended.\n\nJabavu edited the first newspapers to be written in the Xhosa and from 1876 he edited *Isigidimi samaXhosa* (\"The Xhosa Messenger\"). From 1884 he edited *Imvo Zabantsundu* (\"Black Opinion\"). He wrote on the threat of Afrikaner nationalism, equal rights for South Africa's black population, and in support of women's rights.\n\nThe rivalry between the Fengu and the Gcaleka Xhosa, which had previously broken out into war, declined during the era of Jabavu's leadership, as greater unity was encouraged. Nonetheless, some divisions remained. Jabavu's main political rival, Walter Rubusana, was Xhosa. Rubusana's rise in the 1890s was through the new Gcaleka-dominated South African Native National Congress and their newspaper *Izwi Labantu* (\"The Voice of the People\") which was financed by Cecil Rhodes. The rise of Xhosa institutions meant that Jabavu and the Fengu were no longer in a position to provide the only leadership in the Cape's Black community.\n\nOver the next few decades, divisions persisted between Jabavu's movement *Imbumba* (\"The Union\") and Rubusana's South African Native National Congress. However the rivalry was finally laid to rest and there was union under the newly named African National Congress. One of the early aims of this movement was finally to lay to rest \"the aberrations of the Xhosa-Fingo feud.\"[15][16]\n\n### British annexation\n\n[edit]British Kaffraria had been annexed to the Cape Colony in 1866. Barring the brief revolt in 1877 and 1878, when the Gcaleka turned upon their Fengu neighbours, the British annexation of land east of the Kei River proceeded fitfully, but generally unimpeded. In September 1879 this was followed by Idutywa Reserve and Fenguland, and Gcalekaland in 1885. It is assumed that the restructuring of these territories into the divisions of Butterworth, Idutywa, Centani, Nqamakwe, Tsomo and Willowvale dates from these times.\n\n### Social change and adaptability\n\n[edit]Originally farmers, the Fengu people had quickly built themselves schools, created and edited their own newspapers, and translated international literature into their language. The reason that the Fengu people were able to adapt so effectively to changing circumstances (like the coming of capitalism and urbanisation) was because they lacked a fixed tribal social-structure and hierarchy (having presumably lost it in their earlier flight from the Zulu). This state of social change and flexibility allowed them to quickly adjust to the European expansion, learn and adapt new techniques, and take advantage of the upheavals that followed. Other tribes were often suspicious of outside ideas and consequently resisted any change to meet the colonial threat. The Fengu had no paramount-chief as other tribes did, but the Cape Commander, Veldman Bikitsha, was a Fengu and held authority over the Fengu's military capacity.\n\nMany Fengu have also subsequently intermarried with other ethnic groups, particularly with the Xhosa and Zulu, while some still live in Zimbabwe.\n\n## Territory\n\n[edit]The region that was later known as the Transkei was originally divided into territories known as the Idutywa Reserve, Fingoland and Galekaland (Gcalekaland). Fingoland lay the borderlands in the far south of the Transkei, just north of the Kei River.\n\nFollowing their annexation by the British however, they were restructured into the divisions of Butterworth, Tsomo and Ngqamakwe for Fingoland; Centani and Willowvale for Galekaland; and Idutywa for the Idutywa Reserve.\n\n## Present-day South Africa\n\n[edit]Today virtually all the Fengu people have intermarried with other ethnic groups particularly with the Xhosa and Zulu. Many are now often considered \u2013 especially by outsiders \u2013 to be ethnically Xhosa and others Zulu, because of their common language and some similar customs. A considerable number have a mixed racial background, especially in and around the Cape provinces.\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]**^**Mtumane, Zilibele (2017). \"The Practice of Ubuntu with regard to amaMfengu among amaXhosa as Depicted in S.

Known for his mastery of Congolese rumba, he was nicknamed by fans and critics \"Sorcerer of the Guitar\" and the \"Grand Ma\u00eetre of Zairean Music\", as well as **Franco de Mi Amor** by female fandom.[10][11][12] AllMusic described him as perhaps the \"big man in African music\".[13] His extensive musical repertoire was a social commentary on love, interpersonal relationships, marriage, decorum, politics, rivalries, mysticism, and commercialism.[14][15][16] In 2023, *Rolling Stone* ranked him at number 71 on its list of the 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.[17]\n\nBorn in Sona-Bata in Kongo Central and raised in Kinshasa,[18][19][20] Franco was mentored in his youth by Congolese musicians Paul Ebengo Dewayon and Albert Luampasi, who helped introduce him to the music industry.[21][22][23] He initially performed with Luampasi's band, Bandidu, alongside Dewayon, and later worked with Dewayon's band Watam, under the auspices of the Loningisa label, managed by Greek music executive Basile Papadimitriou.[21] After a successful audition for producer Henri Bowane, Franco was signed to a long-term contract by Loningisa.[24]: 54 [21] In 1954, he joined LOPADI (*Loningisa de Papadimitriou*), during which period Bowane coined the moniker \"Franco\".[21]\n\nFranco co-founded OK Jazz in 1956, which emerged as a defining force in Congolese and African popular music.[25][26][27] As the lead guitarist, Franco developed a distinctive style characterized by polyrhythmic sophistication and intricate multi-string plucking, laying the foundation for what became known as the \"OK Jazz School\".[21][28][29][30]: 188 His innovative approach to the sebene, the instrumental section of Congolese rumba, placed it at the song's climax and infused it with a syncopated thumb-and-forefinger plucking technique, revolutionizing the genre.[31][32] This style became central to the band's sound and was deeply rooted in *rumba odemba*, a rhythmic and melodic tradition emanating from the Mongo people of Mbandaka.[21][33][34] His early recordings in the 1950s, including Congolese rumba landmarks: \"Bato Ya Mabe Batondi Mboka\", \"Jos\u00e9phine Naboyi Ye\", and \"Da Da De Tu Amor\", as well as upbeat cha-cha-ch\u00e1 hits like \"Linda Linda\", \"Maria Valenta\", and \"Alliance Mode Succ\u00e8s\", helped define the Congolese rumba's sound across Central, Eastern, and parts of Western Africa,[35] while \"On Entre O.K., On Sort K.O.\" became the band's emblematic motto.[36][37][38]\n\nIn 1967, Franco became the band's co-leader alongside vocalist Vicky Longomba, and when Vicky departed in 1970, Franco assumed full leadership.[39] The following year, the band was rebranded as *Tout-Puissant Orchestre Kinois de Jazz* (TPOK Jazz), meaning \"The Almighty Kinshasa Jazz Orchestra\".[40][41][42] Throughout the 1970s, Luambo became increasingly engaged in the political sphere, aligning himself with President Mobutu Sese Seko's state ideology of *Authenticit\u00e9*.[43][44][45] He wrote numerous songs extolling Mobutu and his administration.[46] By the early 1980s, a significant number of TPOK Jazz members had relocated to Europe, seeking refuge from the worsening socio-economic conditions in Kinshasa.[47] Despite the dispersion, the band remained remarkably productive, releasing a series of hits, including \"12 600 Lettres\" (1981), \"Lettre \u00e0 Mr. Le Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" (1983), a collaboration with Tabu Ley Rochereau and his Orchestre Afrisa International, and \"Non\" (1983).[48][49][50][39] The Franco-Madilu duo yielded some of their standout releases: \"Mamou\" (alternately known as \"Tu Vois\", 1984), \"Mario\" (1985), \"La Vie des Hommes\" (1986), and \"Batela Makila Na Ngai\" (also known as \"Sadou\", 1988).[39][51][52]\n\nIn recognition of his impact on the musical and cultural heritage of Zaire, Franco was named an Officer of the National Order of the Leopard in 1976[53][54][55] and was awarded the Maracas d'Or in 1982 for his influence on Francophone music.[56][39][57] Though twice married, Franco's personal life was often marred by well-known infidelities.[39] In his final years, rapid weight loss and persistent rumors of AIDS overshadowed his career, prompting his 1988 song \"Les Rumeurs (Baiser ya Juda)\" as a direct response. Franco died in 1989 in Mont-Godinne, Yvoir, Belgium.[39][58]\n\n## Life and career\n\n[edit]### 1938\u20131952: Early life and career beginnings\n\n[edit]Fran\u00e7ois Luambo Luanzo Makiadi was born on 6 July 1938 in Sona-Bata , a town located in then-Bas-Congo Province (now Kongo Central), in what was then the Belgian Congo (later the Republic of the Congo, then Zaire, and currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo).[18][19][20] He came from an interethnic background: his father, Joseph Emongo, was a Tetela railway worker, while his mother, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mbongo Makiese, was Kongo with Ngomb\u00e9 roots through her paternal lineage.[59][60] Luambo was one of three children from their matrimonial union, along with his siblings Siongo Bavon (alias Bavon Marie-Marie) and Marie-Louise Akangana.[21] Following Joseph Emongo's death, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had three additional children, Alphonse Derek Malolo, Marie Jeanne Nyantsa, and Jules Kinzonzi, with two different partners.[21]\n\nLuambo was raised in L\u00e9opoldville (presently Kinshasa) on Opala Avenue, within the district of Dendale (modern-day Kasa-Vubu commune). He matriculated at L\u00e9o II primary school in Kintambo.[21] By 1948, he became increasingly enamored with music, inspired by the emerging Congolese rumba scene, mainly through musicians like Joseph Athanase Tshamala Kabasele (colloquially known as Le Grand Kall\u00e9).[21] Luambo started out by playing the harmonica. In 1949, at the age of 11, he experienced the loss of his father, which effectively curtailed his formal education due to financial constraints.[21] With no alternative to continue his schooling, he began devoting his time to playing the harmonica and other instruments and later joined a group called Kebo, noted for its rhythmic sound, primarily produced by *patenge*, a wooden frame drum held between the legs, with its tone altered by pressing the skin with the heel.[21] As financial hardships exacerbated, Luambo's mother, apprehensive about his future, sought assistance from a family acquaintance, Daniel Bandeke. Bandeke secured Luambo a job packing records at a well-known record label and studio named Ngoma.[21] There, entranced by the musicians he met, he clandestinely taught himself to play guitar whenever the musicians finished their recordings. According to Congolese musicologist Cl\u00e9ment Ossinond\u00e9, Luambo's ability quickly became apparent, with immense astonishment prevailing \"the day it was discovered that the packer was a budding guitar genius\".[21]\n\nIn 1950, the family relocated from Opala Avenue to Bosenge Street in Ngiri-Ngiri. They rented a house owned by the family of the famed Congolese musician Paul Ebengo Dewayon, who owned a homemade guitar, was making significant progress as a guitarist, and worked at the Tissaco textile factory\u2014part of the Belgian Congo's UTEXL\u00c9O manufacturing group.[61][62] Luambo and Dewayon struck up a friendship, which allowed him to further hone his musical skills. Another notable mentor was Albert Luampasi, a guitarist and composer affiliated with Ngoma.[61] Under Luampasi's tutelage, Luambo further polished his guitar skills. He was then included in Luampasi's fold alongside Paul, and they began attending performances with his band, Bandidu.[61] Although, at that time, musical pursuits were viewed as degrading and synonymous with delinquency for those who engaged in them, Luambo pursued it with immense zeal to assist his mother, whose sole source of sustenance for the entire family came from Mama Makiese's operation of a doughnut stall at the Ngiri-Ngiri market colloquially known as *wenze ya bayaka*.[61][63] In 1952, Luambo officially joined Bandidu and toured with the group in Bas-Congo, including an extended stay in Moerbeke, Kwilu Ngongo, where they remained for several months.[61] By that juncture, Albert Luampasi had already released four tracks with Ngoma, which enabled Luambo to forge a strong reputation.[61] Tracks such as \"Ch\u00e9rie Mabanza\", \"Nzola Andambo\", \"Ziunga Kia Tumba\", and \"Mu Kintwadi Kieto\" became emblematic of this period.[61] He also became associated with the Bills subculture during this period.[64]\n\n### 1953: Watam\n\n[edit]Luambo's period with the L\u00e9opoldville-based band Watam, remains a topic of scholarly debate. British musicologist Gary Stewart contends that Luambo co-founded Watam in 1950 with Paul Ebengo Dewayon, alongside aspiring musicians Louis Bikunda, Ganga Mongwalu, and Mutombo.[24]: 53 According to this account, the band played sporadic gigs over the next three years, earning small rewards for their efforts.[24]: 53 In contrast, Congolese music historian Cl\u00e9ment Ossinond\u00e9 offers a differing perspective, asserting that Watam was initially formed by Dewayon and that Luambo joined the group in 1953 upon his return to L\u00e9opoldville.[61][65] That same year, Watam garnered critical acclaim with the release of two songs composed by Paul: \"Bokilo Ay\u00e9bi Kobota\" and \"Nyekesse\", released on 5 February 1953 through Loningisa record label and studio.[61] The band regularly performed in the Ngiri-Ngiri commune, particularly at Kanza Bar on Rue de Bosenge, where they captivated local audiences.[61]\n\nRegardless of the precise chronology, Luambo and Paul soon auditioned for Henri Bowane.[24]: 54 [61] Bowane then introduced Luambo to Greek producer and record executive Basile Papadimitriou at Loningisa studio on 9 August 1953.[61] Impressed by Luambo's virtuosity during the audition, Papadimitriou quickly signed him to a 10-year production contract.[61] As a token of recognition for his burgeoning abilities, Luambo was gifted a modern guitar nicknamed *Libaku ya nguma* (\"the head of the boa\") due to its considerable size.[66][67][61] It became Luambo's foremost professional guitar, which he played during studio sessions alongside Paul and Watam, rehearsing and recording tracks that met the studio's stringent criteria.[61] After the original Loningisa studio in Foncobel was deemed inadequate, Papadimitriou temporarily relocated operations to the city while constructing a new, luxurious studio in Limete, a burgeoning area south of the airport in L\u00e9opoldville.[68] Limete's strategic location on Boulevard L\u00e9opold III (now Boulevard Lumumba) allowed easy access to the band's recording activities.[68] Throughout 1953, Watam produced several notable recordings, including \"Esengo Ya Mokili\", \"Tuba Mbote\", \"Bikunda\", and \"Groupe Watam\", all written by Paul.[61] In November 1953, Luambo recorded his debut tracks with Watam at Loningisa, under the name Lwambo Fran\u00e7ois: \"Lilima Dis Cherie Wa Ngai\" and \"Kombo Ya Loningisa\".[61] He continued collaborating with Watam, contributing to subsequent compositions such as \"Yembele Yembele\" and \"Tango Ya Pokwa\", which debuted on 16 December.[61] He also participated in the recording of songs composed by fellow Watam members, including Mutombo's singles \"Tongo Etani Matata\" and \"Tika Kobola Tolo\", released on 17 December.[61]\n\n### 1954\u20131961: Rise with LOPADI and OK Jazz\n\n[edit]#### Joining LOPADI and formation of OK Jazz\n\n[edit]In 1954, Luambo joined the LOPADI (* Loningisa de Papadimitriou*), a band operating under the \"Loningisa\" banner, led by Bowane, who gave him the epithet \"Franco\" that subsequently metamorphosed into his professional stage name.\n\n[61]\n\n[24]\n\n: 52He collaborated with fellow musicians such as Philippe Lando Rossignol, Daniel Loubelo \"De la lune\", Edo Nganga, and Bosuma Dessouin, quickly standing out with his signature guitar technique and musical inventiveness.\n\n[61]\n\n[69]His debut solo recordings, \"Marie Catho\" and \"Bayini Ngai Mpo Na Yo\" (alternatively titled \"Bolingo Na Ngai Na B\u00e9atrice\"), premiered on 14 October 1955 and swiftly gained widespread attention, earning him the affectionate sobriquet \"Franco de Mi Amor\" from an expanding female fandom.\n\n[61]\n\n[70]The records were acclaimed as the year's crowning achievement. The fiercely competitive scene of the mid-1950s, particularly the rivalry between the Ngoma and Opika, afforded LOPADI a platform to promote its artists.\n\n[61]Under Bowane's guidance, the band prioritized the cultivation of its musicians, with Franco standing out due to his original take on harmony and rhythm, allowing him to cultivate distinctive sound subtleties that resonated with audiences and set him apart from his contemporaries.\n\n[61]\n\nDuring the latter part of 1955, Franco was part of Bana Loningisa (\"children of Loningisa\"), a loosely organized coalition of L\u00e9opoldville musicians that commenced collaborative efforts under the auspices of Loningisa.[24]: 56\u201359 [71] On 6 June 1956, at the bar-dancing venue \"Home de *Mul\u00e2tre*\", several musicians from Bana Loningisa, engaged by Oscar Kassien, who had become well-acquainted with performing at the O.K. Bar dance hall (named in tribute to its owner, Oskar Kassien), every Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon, concurrently with their weekday commitments at the studio, thus formed an orchestra that adopted the name \"OK Jazz\".[61][72][73] The idea was conceived by Jean Serge Essous, who had found a better way to honor Oscar Kassien (later to become Kashama) for his laudable initiative in providing the group with instruments and the venue where it commenced.[24]: 56\u201359 [61] The newly established band, under the guidance of Oscar Kashama Kassien, initially had around ten musicians: Franco, Essous, Daniel Loubelo \"De La Lune\", Philippe Lando Rossignol, Ben Saturnin Pandi, Moniania \"Roitelet\", Marie-Isidore Diaboua \"Li\u00e8vre\", Liberlin de Soriba Diop, Pella \"Lamontha\", Bosuma Dessoin, before ultimately consolidating to seven for the solemn outing that took place on 20 June 1956 at Parc de Boeck (now Jardin Botanique de Kinshasa).[61] While clarinetist Jean Serge Essous became the band's chief (*chef d'orchestre*), Franco emerged as a prolific songwriter; Essous called him a \"kind of genius\" for having written over a hundred songs in his notebooks then.[24]: 56\u201359 [71]\n\n#### Sound development, lineup changes, and the rise of fan culture\n\n[edit]Franco also became known for his mastery of the \"sixth\" technique, wherein he plucked multiple strings at once, a style from which he gave birth to what became known as the \"OK Jazz School\".[61] This technique was central to the band's signature sound, which drew heavily from *rumba odemba*, a rhythmic and stylistic approach said to have roots in the folklore of the Mongo ethnic group from Mbandaka.[61] Social anthropologist Bob W. White characterizes *rumba odemba* as rhythmic, repetitive, visceral, and traditionalist.[74] The style often featured three interweaving guitars, a six-person vocal section, a seven-piece horn section, bass guitar, a drummer, and a conga player.[75] All was led by Franco on guitar and part-time lead vocals.[75] O.K. Jazz quickly became a rival to the leading established band of that time, African Jazz under \"Le Grand Kall\u00e9\" Kabasele, with Franco rivaling premier Congolese guitarists Emmanuel Tshilumba wa Boloji \"Tino Baroza\" and Nicolas \"Dr. Nico\" Kasanda.[61] He collaborated closely with Jean Serge Essous, creating a dynamic partnership that yielded some of the band's most revered tracks, including Franco's written Congolese rumba-infused breakout anthem \"On Entre O.K., On Sort K.O.\", released in December 1956 by the new (and ephemeral) lineup of O.K. Jazz following personnel alterations. \"On Entre O.K., On Sort K.O.\" achieved considerable success and evolved into the band's emblematic motto.[61][24]: 56\u201359 [71]\n\nOn 28 December 1956, O.K. Jazz began to see changes in its lineup. New musicians, including Edouard Ganga \"Edo\", C\u00e9lestin Kouka, Nino Malapet (previously of the disbanded Negro Jazz orchestra), and Antoine Armando \"Brazzos\", were integrated into the band on 31 December, filling the void left by departing members.[61] By 1957, O.K. Jazz lost its leader, Essous, as well as original vocalist Philippe \"Rossignol\" Lando, when they were hired away by Bowane for his new record label, Esengo (Bowane had departed from Loningisa after O.K. Jazz eclipsed his influence).[24]: 64\u201365 While vocalist Vicky Longomba became the band's new leader, Franco also stepped up as the band's primary guitarist and overseer of musical direction.[24]: 64\u201365 [61] That same year, Franco composed the popular song \"Aya la Mode\", which incorporated the guitar riff from the internationally renowned track \"La Bamba\". The song exemplified the *muziki* phenomenon then burgeoning in L\u00e9opoldville, wherein youth orchestras cultivated devoted fan communities similar to contemporary fan clubs.[76] O.K. Jazz, in particular, was supported by two influential groups: a male fan club named AGES (*Association des Gentlemen S\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s*) and a female counterpart known as *La Mode*. These fan clubs became central to the band's image and were frequently acknowledged in musical dedications.[76] The 1957 track \"Bana Ages\", released as the B-side to \"Aya la Mode\", paid tribute to these groups. In the lyrics, Franco sings: \"Don't be surprised that I dedicate my song today to the friends of the AGES club\/Along with the *La Mode* club, they form\/A harmonious union\/If I were a woman\/I would have married a member of the AGES club\/And I would be proud\".[76] One prominent member of *La Mode*, Pauline Masouba, would later become Franco's first wife. During this period of growing popularity and youthful exuberance, Franco acquired the affectionate nickname \"Franco de Mi Amor\", a moniker that he had inscribed on his guitar. His rising appeal, especially with young female admirers, soon reached national proportions.[77] This widespread acclaim was noted in a 1957 article published by the *Agence* *Congolaise de Presse*, in which then-Congolese Information Minister Jean Jacques Kande observed: \"In the most frequented bars in the city, he pinches his guitar, many young girls stir in his direction in tribute to their rooted damn and gratify the looks that would derail a train launched at full speed. Because Franco is an undeniable and undisputed master of the guitar...\"[69]\n\n#### Key departures, Rock-a-Mambo's emergence, pre-independence upheaval, and first European excursion\n\n[edit]Later in 1957, Essous, Rossignol, and percussionist Pandy, all of whom were originally from Brazzaville, left O.K. Jazz to establish a new band, Rock-a-Mambo. The band quickly gained prominence, releasing hit songs that rivaled and in some instances eclipsed the popularity of O.K. Jazz's output.[77] Their success posed a challenge to Papadimitriou, who sent urgent telegrams to the band, then on tour in Brazzaville, urging them to produce competitive new material.[77] Following a year-long stay in Brazzaville, O.K. Jazz returned to L\u00e9opoldville in early 1958.

With its rhythms, melodies, and lyrics, Congolese rumba has gained global recognition and remains an integral part of African music heritage. In December 2021, it was added to the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage.[2][3][4] Known for its rhythmic patterns, guitar solos, and emotive vocals\u2014primarily performed in Lingala, though also in French, Kikongo, Swahili, and Luba\u2014the genre is defined by its multilayered, cyclical guitar riffs, a rhythm section anchored by electric bass and percussion, and the sebene: a high-energy instrumental bridge that inspires both dancers and atalaku (hype men).[5][6][7][8]\n\nEmerging in the mid-20th century in the urban centers of Brazzaville and L\u00e9opoldville (now Kinshasa) during the colonial era, the genre's roots can be traced to the Bakongo partner dance music known as *maringa*, which was traditionally practiced within the former Kingdom of Loango, encompassing regions of contemporary Republic of the Congo, southern Gabon, and Cabinda Province of Angola.[9][10][11] The style gained prominence in the 1920s\u20131940s, introducing the advent of the \"bar-dancing\" culture in Brazzaville and L\u00e9opoldville, which incorporated distinctive elements such as a bass drum, a bottle employed as a triangle, and an accordion known as *likembe*.[10][12][13][14] During the mid-1940s and 1950s, the influence of Cuban son bands transformed *maringa* into \"Congolese rumba\", as imported records by Sexteto Habanero, Trio Matamoros, and Los Guaracheros de Oriente were frequently misattributed as \"rumba\".[15][16] The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of soukous, an urban dance music style that emanated from Congolese rumba, imbuing it with lively rhythms, intricate high-pitched guitar melodies, and large brass and polyrhythmic percussion sections.[17][18] Soukous gradually incorporated modern musical trends, paving the way for ndombolo, which emerged in the late 1990s and adopted contemporary production techniques, adding synthesizers and digital sound technologies to appeal to new generations.[19]\n\nThe style has gained popularity across central, eastern, southern, and western Africa, where it is regarded as the \"origin of all subsequent West African musical movements\".[20][21][22] Additionally, it has found a following in Europe, particularly in France, Belgium, Germany, and the UK, as well as in the US, as a result of touring by Congolese musicians, who have performed at various festivals internationally. Musicians such as Paul Kamba, Henri Bowane, Wendo Kolosoy, Manuel d'Oliveira, L\u00e9on Bukasa, Franco Luambo Makiadi, Le Grand Kall\u00e9, TPOK Jazz, African Jazz, Beguen Band, Nico Kasanda, Verckys Kiamuangana Mateta, Tabu Ley Rochereau, Sam Mangwana, Papa No\u00ebl Nedule, Vicky Longomba, Za\u00efko Langa Langa, Papa Wemba, and Koffi Olomide have made significant contributions to the genre, pushing its boundaries and incorporating modern musical elements.[23][24][2]\n\n## Characteristics\n\n[edit]### Tempo and instrumental composition\n\n[edit]The Congolese rumba is characterized by a slow-to-moderate tempo and syncopated arrangement of drums and percussion, typically following a **4** 4 time signature.\n\n[25]The genre's instrumentation has evolved over time. Initially, local tunes were concocted employing instruments such as the\n\n*likembe*, a bottle struck with a metal rod, and a small, skin-covered frame drum called\n\n*patenge*.\n\n[26]\n\n[9]However, in the 1920s, maringa bands supplanted the\n\n*likembe*with accordions and acoustic guitars.\n\n[26]By the 1950s, bands expanded significantly. For instance, Manuel d'Oliveira and Les San Salvador (1952) utilized three guitars, a clarinet, and a scraper, while Antoine Wendo Kolosoy (1956) included three guitars, bass, maracas, and claves.\n\n[27]By the mid-to-late 1950s, the instrumentation diversified further with \"orchestres\", or big bands, becoming the standard and incorporating upright basses, trumpets, saxophones, and more elaborate percussion setups.\n\n[27]The contemporary Congolese rumba instrumental makeup primarily includes guitars, mandolins, banjos, drums, saxophones, clarinets, trumpets, maracas, pianos, shakers, double bells (\n\n*ekonga*),\n\n*likembe*, accordion, and racketts.\n\n[28]\n\n### Guitars\n\n[edit]In the late 1940s and 1950s, Congolese rumba guitars were typically tuned to a \"Hawaiian\" open tuning (D-G-D-G-B-D), with musicians employing a capo to alter keys, producing a buzzing effect highly esteemed in the genre.[27] The lead guitar carries the primary melodic responsibility, executing intricate, high-register lines that require speed, precision, and nimble fingerwork high on the fretboard.[29] During slower rumba or mid-tempo vocal sections, the lead guitarist performs free-flowing melodies in response to the singers,[29] while the rhythm guitar maintains the basic cyclic pattern of the composition, and the *mi-solo* guitar occupies an intermediary role\u2014its name, meaning \"half-solo\", denoting its role as a bridge between the high-pitched lead and low-pitched rhythm guitars.[30][31][32] The bass guitar reinforces the clave beat and provides the harmonic framework for the ensemble.[27]\n\nFollowing the slower vocal sections, an instrumental interlude called the sebene introduces a rapid tempo and intensified guitar articulations,[29][33][34] with the drummer using the cavacha pattern to drive the ensemble toward the high-energy conclusion.[29][34] During the sebene, interlocking call-and-response patterns among the guitarists are essential, and all players adjust their parts according to the drummer's cues to complement the lead guitar, typically following the standard I\u2013IV\u2013V\u2013IV Congolese progression.[35][29] Variations on the diatonic major scale predominate, with the lead guitar often carrying the melody in the absence of vocals and occupying the highest register, while singers simultaneously transition to rhythmic chanting in the animation section, typically accompanied by *atalaku* performers, as the guitars assume greater prominence within the overall texture.[35][29][34][33] The sebene motivates the audience to dance, and singers call out patrons' names during *libanga*, a practice of respect and encouragement that also promotes tipping.[35]\n\n### Musical structure\n\n[edit]A prototypical Congolese rumba composition begins with a slow, vocal-centered introduction, and transitions into the sebene,[29][33][34] providing space for interactive musical dialogue among singers, guitars, and other instruments, while *atalaku* performers interject rhythmic exclamations and cues to enhance the communal energy of the performance.[27][29][33][34] Vocal harmonies are typically arranged in thirds, with occasional octaves or fifths employed for special effects.[27][30][31][32] The genre often incorporates three types of call-and-response interactions: between singer and chorus, between singer and instrument, and among different instrumental sections.[27] This interplay, combined with a mix of homophony and polyrhythm, creates a rich, textured sound.[27] Melodic interest usually centers on a single part, supported by subordinate accompaniment, while the rhythmic texture is dense and varied across instruments. Horns often punctuate rather than carry the melodic line, except when \"used antiphonally with the lead singer or chorus\".[27] Improvisation in Congolese rumba is generally motif-based, involving variations on themes, often utilizing intervals like thirds and sixths.[27] Performances are typically delivered in French, Lingala, Swahili, Spanish, Kikongo, and Tshiluba.[36] The vocal delivery encompasses a wide range of expressive modalities, such as vibrato, falsetto, and melismatic ornamentations.[25]\n\n## History\n\n[edit]### Origins\n\n[edit]A proposed etymology for the term \"rumba\" is that it derives from the Kikongo word *nkumba*, meaning \"belly button\", denoting the native dance practiced within the former Kingdom of Congo, encompassing parts of the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, and Angola.[37][38][39] Its rhythmic foundation draws from Bantu traditions, notably the Palo Kongo religion, which traces back to the Kongo people who were unceremoniously transported to Cuba by Spanish settlers in the 16th century.[40][41][42][43]\n\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Barnet Lanza's treatise *On Congo Cults of Bantu Origin in Cuba* explains that the majority of enslaved Africans brought to Cuba were initially of Bantu lineage, although later, the Yoruba from Nigeria became dominant.[44] The musical traditions, dance forms, and spiritual practices were covertly preserved across generations within regions characterized by significant populations of enslaved Africans.[45] Musical instruments like the conga, makuta, cat\u00e1, yambu, claves, and g\u00fciro were used to craft a musical dialogue that engaged in call and response with ancestral spirits and the deceased.[46][40] Notable figures like Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez blended traditional Bakongo sounds with Cuban son.[43]\n\nAccording to Phyllis Martin's *Leisure and Society in Colonial Brazzaville*, the popular partnered dance music in the former French Congo and Belgian Congo, which now constitute the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, respectively, was known as *maringa*.[10] *Maringa* was a Bakongo dance similar to West African highlife and historically practiced within the former Kingdom of Loango, covering areas in the present-day Republic of the Congo, southern Gabon, and Cabinda Province of Angola.[9] The dance involved a small skin-covered frame drum called *patenge* for counter-rhythms, a bottle functioning as a triangle, and an accordion known as *likembe*, which possessed seven to nine steel reeds.[10] The distinctive movements of *maringa* dancers involved a rhythmic hip sway that shifted body weight alternately from one leg to the other, reminiscent of the Afro-Cuban rumba dance, which later eclipsed older dances and musical forms.[10] The penchant for partnered dance traversed the Congo region by 1930.[10] Ethnomusicology professor Kazadi wa Mukuna of Kent State University explains that many recording studio proprietors at the time began to market *maringa* as \"rumba\", while retaining its original name.[15] Martin also observes that White society in Brazzaville, much like elsewhere, developed an interest in Latin American dance music, particularly the rumba, after it had been featured and made respectable at the 1932 Chicago World Fair.[47] However, both the White elite and African aristocracy predominantly embraced the tango and the biguine, a dance reminiscent of the Brazilian samba but originating from Martinique, alongside other transatlantic dances.[47]\n\nIn 1934, Jean R\u00e9al, a French entertainment director from Martinique, coined the term \"Congo Rumba\" when he founded an ensemble by that name in Brazzaville in 1938.[16][10][48] Cl\u00e9ment Ossinond\u00e9, a Congolese musicologist specializing in Congolese music, notes that among the Congolese musicians affiliated with Congo Rumba, Gabriel Kakou and Georges Mozebo were prominent figures instrumental in popularizing the genre and mentoring emerging local musicians.[49][50][51]\n\n### Modern Congolese rumba evolution\n\n[edit]#### Influence of migrant workers on Congolese rumba\n\n[edit]The substantial influx of students from Central Africa at the Ecole Ex\u00e9cutive de Brazzaville and the construction of the Congo\u2013Ocean Railway, which enticed a significant migrant workforce from Central and West Africa between 1930 and 1934, catalyzed the evolution of Congolese rumba in Brazzaville.[28] Emmanuel Okamba, a Congolese musicologist, posits that these West African laborers introduced the highlife rhythm, played on a large drum, which delineated the tempo of the emerging musical genre.[28] He further explains that Zacharie Elenga (popularly known as Jhimmy Zakari), introduced a rhythm inspired by a Cuban sound, dominated by highlife and polka.[28] Some musicologists assert that these immigrant laborers played a seminal role in pioneering the instrumental component of Congolese rumba known as sebene, albeit this contention is often debated, with other musicologists accrediting Antoine Kasongo's orchestra, Antoine Wendo Kolosoy, Henri Bowane, and F\u00e9lix Manuaku Waku instead.[52][53][54][55][56] According to British musicologist Gary Stewart's *Rumba on the River: A History of the Popular Music of the Two Congos*, some scholars even trace sebene's origins further back to transitional genres in Brazzaville, such as the kebo. Stewart expounds that the segment where most dancing transpired was designated as the sebene. One Lingala dictionary defines sebene as dance, although the precise moment of its linguistic integration remains ambiguous.[54]\n\n#### Emergence of local musicians\n\n[edit]The vocal ensemble Bonne Esp\u00e9rance emerged in 1935, conceived by the organist Albert Loboko, known as \"Nyoka\", a Congolese footballer born in Mossaka and a schoolmate of Paul Kamba.[28][57][58] Accompanied by musicians Raymond Nguema, Joseph Botokoua, and Bernardin Yoka, Bonne Esp\u00e9rance performed their music at venues such as Chez Mamadou Moro and the Cercle Culturel Catholique de Poto-Poto in Brazzaville.[28] After his return from Mindouli, where he served as an accountant at Congo\u2013Ocean Railway, Kamba introduced a \"new musical language\" incorporating string and keyboard instruments.[28] In early 1937, the musical ensemble Mannequin was established in Bacongo, under the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Bamanabio, who, alongside Massamba L\u00e9bel, later founded the Jazz Boh\u00e8me orchestra.[28] However, R\u00e9al's arrangements and inclusion of contemporary instruments to local musicians later that year conferred substantial advantages on Brazzaville's native artists, including Alphonse Samba, Michel Kouka, Georges Nganga, C\u00f4me Batoukama (guitar), Vital Kinzonzi (accordion), Emmanuel Dadet (saxophone, guitar, and more), and Albert Loboko (banjo, piano, guitar).[49][59] Four brass bands subsequently emerged in Brazzaville, including the Fanfare Militaire, the Fanfare de la Milice, the Fanfare Catholique, and the Fanfare Municipale.[60]\n\nDadet and Antoine Kasongo pioneered the contemporary rendition of Congolese folk music by incorporating new influences into their songs.[60] Dadet, proficient on the saxophone, clarinet, and guitar, devised a musical style characterized by \"free polyphony\", inspired by jazz soloists.[60] His ensemble, Melo-Congo, garnered acclaim among the White elite, performing a diverse repertoire ranging from classic waltzes and foxtrots to contemporary rumba, biguines, and tangos.[10] The ensemble bolstered the prominence of local artists such as Pierre Mara, Georges Ondaye, Jean-Marie Okoko, Philippe Ngaba, Pierre Kanza, Casimir Bounda, Jean Dongou, Augustin Thony, Andr\u00e9 Tsimba, Pierre Loemba, Bar\u00e8te Mody, Pascal Kakou, F\u00e9lix Maleka, and Botokoua. Melo-Congo enjoyed tremendous success, performing in Poto-Poto at the dance bar PICKUP, then at dance halls like Chez Fa\u00efgnond, Macumba, Beaut\u00e9 Brazza, Chez Ngambali, Mon Pays, and L\u00e9opoldville.[60][61][10]\n\nAs music thrived in Brazzaville, accordionist Camille Feruzi, originally from Kisangani, relocated to L\u00e9opoldville at the age of 15, where he established one of the city's notable professional *maringa* ensembles, a quartet featuring a piano, acoustic guitar, saxophone, and Feruzi's preferred instrument, the accordion.[62][10][63]\n\n#### Impact of radio broadcasting and international recording companies\n\n[edit]The music of early son cubano bands enjoyed substantial popularity domestically and abroad, which boosted the initiation of the G.V. Series by EMI on the label His Master's Voice in 1933.[64] The G.V. series, intended for export, particularly to Africa, presumably catered to diverse audiences over time as it evolved.[64] The global recording industry reached sub-Saharan Africa relatively late, with a handful of novelty recordings (primarily African \"spirituals\") from the Gold Coast, Nigeria, and South Africa preceding the First World War.[64] By the late 1920s, international labels such as Gramophone Company, Odeon Records, and Path\u00e9 Records began competing for markets across the continent. However, economic adversity, the limited size of local markets, and the war effort constrained the development of local commercial recording until the 1940s.[64] Records from the G.V. series were thus instrumental in the budding African recording industry, becoming some of the most widely circulated records of the 1930s.[64] Most records listened to in L\u00e9opoldville were manufactured in Europe and imported to the Belgian Congo via Matadi, the principal port of entry. During this period, it was customary for African sailors to procure records during their travels abroad, either as gifts or for sale to friends or acquaintances.[64] Such transactions often occurred through itinerant vendors at or near the port upon the arrival of overseas vessels. Following the advent of radio technology in the region, demand for pre-recorded music surged, prompting local merchants to recognize records as a lucrative enterprise. A Belgian radio enthusiast and entrepreneur named Hourdebise, who inaugurated the first commercial radio station in the Belgian Congo in 1939, regularly broadcast records from the G.V. series.[64] He also allocated air time to local artists and was credited with discovering the singer-songwriter Antoine Wendo Kolosoy.[64] Hourdebise's Radio Congoliya featured local and international news in four African languages\u2014Tshiluba, Kikongo, Swahili, and Lingala\u2014and was the first to install loudspeakers for direct broadcasting in the African quarters of the city.[64] Radio Congoliya's popularity spurred local merchants' interest in record sales, with major retailers in the capital, such as SEDEC Montre and Olivant, beginning to import records alongside more costly items like phonographs and radios.[64]\n\nIn August 1941, Paul Kamba formed the Victoria Brazza ensemble in Poto-Poto, accompanied by Henri Pali Baudoin, Jacques Elenga Eboma, Jean Oddet Ekwaka, Fran\u00e7ois Likundu, Mo\u00efse Dinga, Philippe Moukouami, Paul Monguele, Fran\u00e7ois Lokwa, Paul Wonga, Joseph Bakal\u00e9, and Auguste Boukaka.[28] The ensemble's rhythm section incorporated the *maringa* rhythm and traditional instruments, including a bass drum, a *pateng\u00e9*, bells (reminiscent of maracas affixed to hunting dogs), double bells known as *ekonga*, a *likembe*, and modern instruments such as an accordion, a guitar, a mandolin, a banjo, and a rackett. This fusion of modern programmable sounds and the intuitive resonance of *maringa* with non-programmable traditional instruments emerged as a defining characteristic of the \"modern Congolese rumba\".[28]\n\nIn the early 1940s, the music of Cuban son groups, such as Sexteto Habanero, Trio Matamoros, and Los Guaracheros de Oriente, was played on Radio Congo Belge in L\u00e9opoldville, quickly gaining nationwide popularity.[65][66] Congolese musicians began to transpose aspects of Cuban son, including piano sounds, drum patterns, and trumpet phrasing, to electric guitars and saxophones.[67] They occasionally performed in phonetic Spanish or French. Gradually, however, they infused the music with local rhythms and melodies, progressively \n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Open Result 1\n# Arturo Sandoval\n\nArturo Sandoval | |\n|---|---|\n| Background information | |\n| Born | Artemisa, Cuba | 6 November 1949\n| Genres | |\n| Occupation | Musician |\n| Instruments | |\n| Years active | 1962\u2013present |\n| Website | arturosandoval |\n\n**Arturo Sandoval** (born November 6, 1949) is a Cuban-American jazz trumpeter, pianist, timbalero, and composer. While living in his native Cuba, Sandoval was influenced by jazz musicians Charlie Parker, Clifford Brown, and Dizzy Gillespie. In 1977 he met Gillespie, who became his friend and mentor and helped him defect from Cuba while on tour with the United Nation Orchestra. Sandoval became an American naturalized citizen in 1998. His life was the subject of the film *For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story* (2000) starring Andy Garc\u00eda.\n\nSandoval, a 2024 Kennedy Center Honors recipient, has won 10 Grammy Awards, *Billboard* Awards and one Emmy Award. He has performed at the White House[1] and at the Super Bowl (1995).[2]\n\n## Life and career\n\n[edit]Sandoval was born into a poor family in Artemisa, a small village in the province of Havana, Cuba. He started playing music at age 13 in the village band, learning the basics of music theory and percussion. After playing many instruments, he finally settled on the trumpet, playing with street musicians. In 1964, Sandoval enrolled at the Cuban National School of Arts where he took classical trumpet lessons for three years, and earned a place in the country's all-star national band. He helped establish the *Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna*, which became the band Irakere in 1973. He toured worldwide with his own group in 1981. During the following year he toured with Dizzy Gillespie, who became his friend and mentor. From 1982 to 1984, he was voted Cuba's Best Instrumentalist and was a guest artist at the BBC and Leningrad Symphony Orchestras.\n\nIn 1989, Gillespie invited Sandoval to be part of the United Nations Orchestra. During a tour with this group, Sandoval visited the American Embassy in Athens, Greece, accompanied by Gillespie, who helped him with his plan to defect from Cuba. Sandoval became an American citizen on December 7, 1998.[3]\n\nSandoval has performed Latin jazz with Paquito D'Rivera, Tito Puente, and Chico O'Farrill, Cuban music in Miami, and classical music in England and Germany. In the 1990s, he was a member of the GRP All-Star Big Band.[3]\n\nIn 2014, Sandoval performed at Eastman Theatre with Zane Musa, Dave Siegel, Teymur Phel, Johnny Friday, and Armando Arce.[4]\n\nHe has taught at Florida International University and Whitworth University, where he is in charge of its jazz ensemble.[5] He has performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Pittsburgh Symphony and National Symphony Orchestras. In 1996, Sandoval was commissioned by the Kennedy Center Ballet to score *Pepito's Story*, a ballet based on the book by Eugene Fern and choreographed by Debbie Allen. Sandoval also composed a classical trumpet concerto that he performed and recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\n## Awards and honors\n\n[edit]Sandoval's score for a film about his life won an Emmy Award.[6] His compositions and performances can be heard on *The Mambo Kings*, which was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1992 for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television.[7]\n\nHis song \"A Mis Abuelos\" (To My Grandparents) received Grammy Award nominations for Best Instrumental Composition and Best Arrangement. This composition appeared on his Grammy-winning album *Danzon*.[7]\n\nOn November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama presented Sandoval with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[8]\n\nSandoval was a 2024 recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors.[9]\n\n## Other work\n\n[edit]In 2015, Arturo Sandoval joined the 14th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians' careers.[10] He was also a judge for the 10th,[11] 12th[12] and 13th Independent Music Awards.[13]\n\nSandoval did the trumpet solo in a 2018 music video of the Leonid and Friends cover of Chicago's \"Street Player\".[14]\n\n## Discography\n\n[edit]### As leader\n\n[edit]*Turi*(Areito, 1981)*Arturo Sandoval y Su Grupo*(Areito, 1982)*To a Finland Station*with Dizzy Gillespie (Pablo, 1982)*Breaking the Sound Barrier*(Chicago Caribbean, 1983)*Tumbaito*(Messidor, 1986)*No Problem*(Jazz House, 1987)*Straight Ahead*(Jazz House, 1988)*Plays for the Pandas*(Cocoral, 1988)*Just Music*(Jazz House, 1989)*Arturo Sandoval*(Areito, 1991)*Flight to Freedom*(GRP, 1991)*I Remember Clifford*(GRP, 1992)*Dream Come True*(GRP, 1993)*Danz\u00f3n*(GRP, 1994)*The Classical Album*(RCA Victor, 1994)*Arturo Sandoval & the Latin Train*(GRP, 1995)*Swingin'*(GRP, 1996)[15]*Hot House*(N-Coded, 1998)*Americana*(N-Coded, 1999)*Los Elefantes*with Wynton Marsalis (In-akustik, 1999)*For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story*(Atlantic, 2000)*Jam Miami*(Concord, 2000)*Ronnie Scott's Jazz House*(DCC, 2000)*L.

It is known as an important centre for Contemporary Indigenous Australian art, in particular the style created by the Papunya Tula artists in the 1970s, referred to colloquially as dot painting. Its population in 2016 was 404.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]Pintupi and Luritja people were forced off their traditional country in the 1930s and moved into Hermannsburg (Ntaria) and Haasts Bluff, where there were government ration depots. There were often tragic confrontations between these people, with their nomadic hunter-gathering lifestyle, and the cattlemen who were moving into the country and over-using the limited water supplies of the region for their cattle.[ citation needed]\n\nThe Australian Government built a water bore and some basic housing at Papunya in the 1950s to provide room for the increasing populations of people in the already-established Aboriginal communities and reserves. The community grew to over a thousand people in the early 1970s and was plagued by poor living conditions, health problems, and tensions between various tribal and linguistic groups. These festering problems led many people, especially the Pintupi, to move further west closer to their traditional country. After settling in a series of outstations, with little or no support from the government, the new community of Kintore was established about 250 kilometres (160 mi)west of Papunya in the early 1980s.[ citation needed]\n\nThe term \"Finke River Mission\" was initially an alternative name for the mission at Hermannsburg, but this name was later often used to include the settlements at Haasts Bluff, Areyonga and, later, Papunya. It now refers to all Lutheran missionary activity in Central Australia since the first mission was established at Hermannsburg in 1877.[5][6][7]\n\n## Description and demographics\n\n[edit]It is now home to a number of displaced Aboriginal people, mainly from the Pintupi and Luritja groups. At the 2016 Australian census, Papunya had a population of 404.[3]\n\nThe predominant religion at Papunya is Lutheranism, with 310 members, or 78.7% of the population, based on the 2016 census.[3]\n\nIt is the closest town to the Australian continental pole of inaccessibility. Papunya is on restricted Aboriginal land and requires a permit to enter or travel through.[ citation needed]\n\nWarumpi Band were an Australian country and Aboriginal rock group which formed in Papunya.[ citation needed]\n\n## Art\n\n[edit]### Papunya Tula\n\n[edit]During the 1970s a striking new art style emerged in Papunya, which by the 1980s began to attract national and then international attention as a significant Indigenous art movement, colloquially known as dot painting. Leading exponents of the style, who belonged to the Papunya Tula art cooperative founded in Papunya in 1972, included Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri, Kaapa Tjampitjinpa, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, and Pansy Napangardi.[8] The company now operates out of Alice Springs,[9] and covers an enormous area, extending into Western Australia, 700 kilometres (430 mi) west of Alice Springs.[10]\n\n### Papunya Tjupi Arts\n\n[edit]Papunya Tjupi Arts, a community-based, 100% Aboriginal-owned arts organisation, commenced in 2007,[11] and as of March 2021[update] hosts around 150 artists, many of whose works are featured in exhibitions and galleries around the world.[12] In 2009, Michael Nelson Tjakamarra (Kumantje Jagamara) became the artist leader at the arts centre.[13]\n\nArtists include Doris Bush Nungarrayi, Maureen Poulson, Charlotte Phillipus Napurrula, Tilau Nangala, Mona Nangala, Nellie Nangala, Carbiene McDonald Tjangala, Martha McDonald Napaltjarri, Candy Nelson Nakamarra, Dennis Nelson Tjakamarra, Narlie Nelson Nakamarra, Isobel Major Nampatjimpa, Isobel Gorey, Mary Roberts, Beyula Putungka Napanangka, Watson Corby among others.[14]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## Notes\n\n[edit]**^**Australian Bureau of Statistics (28 June 2022). \"Papunya (suburb and locality)\".*Australian Census 2021 QuickStats*.

It is one of the Wati languages of the large Pama\u2013Nyungan family. It is one of the varieties of the Western Desert Language (WDL).\n\nPintupi is a variety of the Western Desert Language spoken by indigenous people whose traditional lands are in the area between Lake Macdonald and Lake Mackay, stretching from Mount Liebig in the Northern Territory to Jupiter Well (west of Pollock Hills) in Western Australia. These people moved (or were forced to move) into the indigenous communities of Papunya and Haasts Bluff in the west of the Northern Territory in the 1940s\u20131980s. The last Pintupi people to leave their traditional lifestyle in the desert came into Kiwirrkura in 1984.[4] Over recent decades they have moved back into their traditional country, setting up the communities of Kintore (in Pintupi known as *Walungurru*) in the Northern Territory, Kiwirrkura and Jupiter Well (in Pintupi *Puntutjarrpa*) in Western Australia.\n\nChildren who were born in Papunya and Haasts Bluff grew up speaking a new variety of Pintupi, now known as **Pintupi-Luritja**, due to their close contact with speakers of Arrernte, Warlpiri and other varieties of the WDL. This has continued through the moves west so that most Pintupi people today speak Pintupi-Luritja, although there remains a clear distinction between the more western and eastern varieties.[ citation needed]\n\nPintupi is one of the healthier Aboriginal languages and is taught to local children in schools.[ citation needed]\n\n## Phonology\n\n[edit]The phonology of Pintupi has been described by K. C. and L. E. Hansen based on fieldwork conducted in Papunya, Northern Territory in 1967\u20131968.[5]\n\n### Consonants\n\n[edit]Pintupi has 17 consonant phonemes. The symbols used in the practical orthography are shown in brackets where they differ from the IPA symbols.\n\n| Peripheral | Coronal | Lamino- palatal | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Bilabial | Velar | Apico- alveolar |\nApico- retroflex |\nLamino- alveolar | ||\n| Plosive | p | k | t | \u0288 \u27e8\u1e6f\u27e9 | t\u033b \u27e8tj\u27e9 | |\n| Nasal | m | \u014b \u27e8ng\u27e9 | n | \u0273 \u27e8\u1e49\u27e9 | n\u033b \u27e8ny\u27e9 | |\n| Trill | r \u27e8rr\u27e9 | |||||\n| Lateral | l | \u026d \u27e8\u1e3b\u27e9 | l\u033b \u27e8ly\u27e9 | |||\n| Approximant | w | \u027b \u27e8r\u27e9 | j \u27e8y\u27e9 |\n\nThe lamino-alveolars are frequently palatalised [t\u033b\u02b2, n\u033b\u02b2, l\u033b\u02b2], and \/t\u033b\/ often has an affricated allophone [t\u02e2].\n\nThe trill \/r\/ usually has a single contact (i.e. a flap [\u027e]) in ordinary speech, but multiple contacts (a true trill) in slow, emphatic, or angry speech. The retroflex approximant \/\u027b\/ may also be realised as a flap [\u027d].\n\nHansen and Hansen (1969) refer to the retroflex consonants as \"apico-domal\".\n\n### Vowels\n\n[edit]Pintupi has six vowel phonemes, three long and three short. All are monophthongal at the phonemic level. Again, the symbols used in the practical orthography are shown enclosed in brackets where they differ from the phonemic symbols.\n\n| Front | Back | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Close | i i\u02d0 \u27e8ii\u27e9 | u u\u02d0 \u27e8uu\u27e9 |\n| Open | a a\u02d0 \u27e8aa\u27e9 |\n\nThe short vowel phonemes are devoiced when word-final at the end of a clause, as in [\u014burakutulpi\u0325] 'he finally (came) to camp', [kapilat\u033bu\u027b\u1e01] 'we all (brought) water for him', and [jilari\u014bu\u0325] 'it was close'.\n\nShort vowels are rhotacised before retroflex consonants, as in [wa\u02de\u0288a] 'tree (generic)', [ka\u02de\u0273a] 'spear (one type)', and [mu\u02de\u026di] 'a shelter'.\n\nThe open vowel \/a\/ is diphthongised to [a\u2071] and [a\u1d58] before \/j\/ and \/w\/ respectively, as in [wa\u2071junpuwa] 'pare (it)' and [ka\u1d58wu\u02de\u0273pa] 'cold ashes'.\n\n### Orthography\n\n[edit]An orthography was developed by the Hansens and is used in their publications, which include a dictionary, a grammar sketch and bible portions. This orthography is also used in the bilingual school, and especially in the school's Literature Production Centre. The orthography is shown in the above tables of consonants and vowels.\n\n### Phonotactics\n\n[edit]Pintupi has only two possible syllable types: CV (a consonant followed by a vowel) and CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant). In the middle of a word, \/m\/ and \/\u014b\/ may appear in the syllable coda only when followed by a homorganic plosive, as in \/t\u033bampu\/ 'left side' and \/mi\u014bki\u027bi\/ 'mouse'. Otherwise, only coronal sonorants may appear in the syllable coda. All consonants except the apico-alveolars and \/l\u033b\/ may appear in word-initial position; only coronal sonorants (except \/\u027b\/) may appear in word-final position. However, at the end of a clause, the syllable \/pa\/ is added to consonant-final words, so consonants may not appear in clause-final position.\n\nShort vowels may appear anywhere in the word; long vowels may appear only in the first syllable (which is stressed), as in \/\u0273i\u02d0rki\/ 'eagle' and \/ma\u02d0ra\/ 'ignorant'.\n\n### Phonological processes\n\n[edit]When a suffix-initial \/t\/ follows a root-final consonant, the \/t\/ assimilates in place of articulation to the preceding consonant, as in \/ma\u026dan\u033b + tu\/ \u2192 [ma\u026dan\u033bt\u033bu] 'younger sibling (transitive subject)', \/pawu\u026d + ta\/ \u2192 [pawu\u026d\u0288a] 'at the spirit ground'. However, the sequence \/r + t\/ undergoes coalescence and surfaces as simple [\u0288], as in \/t\u033bintar + ta\/ \u2192 [t\u033binta\u0288a] 'at Tjintar'.\n\nWhen two identical CV sequences meet at a word boundary, they undergo haplology and fuse into a single word in rapid speech, as in \/mutikaji\u014b**ka ka**\u026dpakati\u014bu\/ \u2192 [mutikaji\u014b**ka**\u026dpakati\u014bu] 'climbed into the car' and \/parari**\u014bu \u014bu**\u027burpa\/ \u2192 [parari**\u014bu**\u027burpa] 'went around the middle'. When a lamino-alveolar consonant or \/j\/ is followed by \/a\/ in the last syllable of a word, and the next word begins with \/ja\/, the word-initial \/j\/ is deleted and the two adjacent \/a\/-sounds merge into a long \/a\u02d0\/, as in \/\u014ba**l\u033ba ja**nuja\/ \u2192 [\u014ba**l\u033ba\u02d0**nuja] 'they all came' and \/wi**ja ja**pura\/ \u2192 [wi**ja\u02d0**pura] 'not west'.\n\n### Prosody\n\n[edit]Pintupi words are stressed on the first syllable. In careful speech, every second syllable after that (i.e. the third, fifth, seventh, etc.) may receive a secondary stress, but secondary stress never falls on the final syllable of the word, as in [\u02c8t\u033baka\u02ccmara\u02ccku\u0273a\u027ba] 'for the benefit of Tjakamara' and [\u02c8juma\u02cc\u027bi\u014bka\u02ccmara\u02cct\u033bu\u027baka] 'because of mother-in-law'. However, the particle \/ka\/ (which indicates a change of subject) is not stressed when it is the first morpheme in a clause, as in \/ka\u02c8janu\/ '(he) went'.\n\n## Works in the language\n\n[edit]### Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\n[edit]Pintupi-Luritja became the first Indigenous Australian language to receive a full, official translation of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights*, when it was translated by elders and linguists at the Australian National University in 2015.[6] Below is Article 1 in Pintupi-Luritja:\n\n*Nganana maru tjuta, tjulkura tjuta, manta yurungka parrari nyinapayi tjutanya liipulala nyinanyi, nganana yanangu maru tjuta wiya kuyakuya.

He was the co-founder with Morton Subotnick of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1962.[2][3] He is the son of Spanish writer Ram\u00f3n J. Sender.\n\n## Education\n\n[edit]Sender was born in Madrid, Spain, and left the country during the civil war following the Fascist coup there in 1936. He studied piano with George Copeland,[4] harmony with Elliott Carter, and counterpoint and fugue with Harold Shapero (1948\u20131951). Sender attended the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome and Columbia University in New York, where he studied with Henry Cowell. He also studied with Robert Erickson at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music (1959\u20131962) and at Mills College, where he studied with Darius Milhaud.[5] Sender holds a Bachelor of Music degree from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and an M.A. from Mills College.\n\n## San Francisco Tape Music Center\n\n[edit]Sender co-founded the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1962 with Morton Subotnick and also collaborated with composers and visual artists including Pauline Oliveros, Tony Martin, Joseph Byrd, Terry Riley, William Maginnis,[6] and many others until 1966 when the Center was incorporated into Mills College. It was later named the Mills Center for Contemporary Music and continues to function today.[7]\n\nSender participated with Don Buchla and Morton Subotnick in the design of the Buchla Box, one of the first music synthesizers.[8]\n\n## Morningstar and Wheeler Ranches\n\n[edit]In January 1966, he co-produced the Trips Festival with Ken Kesey and Stewart Brand. It was a three-day event that, in conjunction with The Merry Pranksters, brought together the nascent hippie movement for the first time.[9][10]\n\nIn April 1966, Sender became the first resident at Lou Gottlieb's Morning Star Ranch (Sender has, at times, referred to himself as Ramon Sender Morningstar) open land commune, which evolved into a Digger Farm \/ open land commune in 1967. After the residents' homes were bulldozed by Sonoma County authorities three times, he moved into the Wheeler Ranch[1] in Occidental, California. Currently both properties have reverted to private ownership. Sender continued living and working in the area until 1980 when he returned to San Francisco. As \"His Imperial Nothingness, Zero the Clown,\" he has continued appearing in the annual Occidental Fools Parade.[11]\n\nOne of the residents at Wheeler at Ranch was Alicia Bay Laurel, a visual artist, author and singer-songwriter known for her 1970 best-seller *Living on the Earth*. He collaborated with her on another book, *Being of the Sun*,[1] which contains information about homemade music, drones, modes, and open tunings as a means of spiritual growth, as well as information about yoga, creating ritual, and forming intentional communities.[12] In 1973, Sender made a reel-to-reel recording of himself and Laurel performing songs, chants and improvisations from the book, which Laurel released in 2013 as a CD on her record label, Indigo With Stars, titled *Songs from Being of the Sun.*\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Sender was one of the founding members of The Occidental Community Choir (the nearest town to the Wheeler Ranch commune), for whom he wrote original music and shared his skills as a choral arranger.[13] The choir's rendition of Sender's arrangement of Laurel's song, \"In the Morning\" appears on her CD, *Music from Living on the Earth.*\n\nIn 2006, stage producer, arranger and bassist Nicholas Alva created a musical based on the story of the open land communes Morningstar and Wheeler Ranch, including songs by Sender. In 2020 the music and dialogue were recorded and released as an ebook.[14][15][16]\n\nSender co-curated \"The Hippies,\" an exhibition re-telling in written narration, photography, art and memorabilia, the history of the west Sonoma County Open Land communes, at the West County Museum in Sebastopol, California (part of the Sonoma County Historical Society.) Running from October 30, 2016, to March 5, 2017, it was the most popular exhibition ever at the West County Museum.[17]\n\n## Later years in San Francisco\n\n[edit]In 1980, Sender returned to San Francisco where he married his long-time friend Judith Levy-Sender, who taught in the San Francisco School District for thirty years. A poet and self-taught artist, he helped her publish two books of poems and artwork, the last titled \"Transitions Visible and Invisible.\" Collaborating with her, they founded the Odd Mondays speaker series that they ran for eighteen years before turning it over to a new producer.\n\nSender is also a visual artist[18] whose visual works are sampled on his web site and in a 2009 book, *Barayon, a Catalog of Prints, Drawings, Original Art*. The book is based on a one-man show at the Gallery Sanchez in 2008.\n\nAfter the death of Sender's daughter Xaverie in 1989, he founded the Peregrine Foundation (for people \"living in or exiting from experimental social groups\").[19] He was the administrator of the foundation until 1999 and published four full-length autobiographies of women who had left the Bruderhof community in a series titled \"Women from Utopia.\"\n\nSender identifies himself as a \"transcendental, post-monotheist hippie pagan sun worshipper, with one foot planted in the nondual teaching of Julie Henderson[20] and the other in the Archaic Revival culture\".[ This quote needs a citation]\n\nIn 2018, Spanish documentary filmmaker Luis Olano released *Sender Baray\u00f3n Un Viaje Hacia La Luz (A Trip into the Light)*, a film about the life and works of Ram\u00f3n Sender Baray\u00f3n, including interviews with Sender at his home in San Francisco, archival photos and footage, and recordings of Sender's music.[21] The film has English subtitles whenever Spanish is spoken, and Spanish subtitles whenever English is spoken, and has been screened in the USA and in Spain. Link to the film's trailer:[22]\"\n\nRam\u00f3n Sender Baray\u00f3n has four children: Xaverie Rhodes (deceased), Jonathan Sender, Andr\u00e9s Sender and Sol Sender, four grandchildren: Gareth Rhodes, Dorie McKernan, David Sender, Rafael Sender, and Oliver Benjamin Sender, and two great-grandchildren: Claire McKernan and Garrett McKernan.\n\n## Writings\n\n[edit]To distinguish himself from his father Ram\u00f3n J. Sender, a well-known Spanish novelist, he uses the Spanish-style name Ram\u00f3n Sender Baray\u00f3n. This is also to honor his late mother Amparo Baray\u00f3n.\n\nSender's novel *Zero Weather* was published in 1980. He has several other unpublished manuscripts and some of his short stories are published on the internet.[23]\n\nIn 1989, Sender published *A Death in Zamora*, a book investigating the execution of his mother by Franco's forces during the Spanish Civil War. The book has been recognized not only as a valuable record of the Spanish Civil War, but as a historical account of early feminism and rebellion against patriarchy in Spain, of which his mother, Amparo Baray\u00f3n, was a pioneer. An updated edition (2018), based on the Spanish Post-Metropolis Editorial 2017 edition, contains essays by renowned Spanish Civil War historians Paul Preston, Helen Graham and Francisco Espinosa Maestre. His cousin Medcedes Esteban Maes-Kemp assisted as translator.[24]\n\nRecently, he published an anthology of his short stories and essays, titled *A Planetary Sojourn*.[25] He also wrote a novel based on his experiences at the Tape Music Center, entitled *Naked Close Up*, which was published in 2012 as an ebook by Intelligent Arts Publishing, a project of The Electronic Music Foundation in Albany, New York.\n\n## Music\n\n[edit]- \"Donkey Gruntler Serenade\", audience participation on Donkey Gruntlers with pre-recorded tape \u2013 2003 live quartet performance by Luciano Chessa and friends\n- \"Aidan's Gamelan (in memory of Lou Harrison)\", audience participation on tuned water drums with pre-recorded tape \u2013 2003\n- \"Seashore Snake Sizzle,\" audience participation on rattles with pre-recorded tape \u2013 2003\n- \"Audition\" for two open-tuned autoharps and dalruba \u2013 1982\n- \"Great-Grandpa Lemuel's Death-Rattle What-In-Tarnation Reincarnation Blues\", dixieland band, accordion, tape \u2013 1981\n- \"A Tewa Prayer\", mixed chorus \u2013 1978\n- \"I Have a Dream\", mixed chorus \u2013 1978\n- Loopy Gamelan \"Oh 'C' Can You Say\", for Oakland Children's Chorus \u2013 1976\n- Loopy Gamelans on 'A' and 'B' for four performers \u2013 1976\n- \"64 I Ching Chants\" (instructions) \u2013 1976\n- \"Outdoor Music for four Open-tuned Autoharps\" \u2013 1970\n- \"Enoughing,\" tape \u2013 1968; \"Ushas\", tape \u2013 1968; \"Xmas Me\", tape \u2013 1968\n- \"In the Garden\", clarinet, viola, projections and tape \u2013 1965\n- \"Desert Ambulance\", amplified accordion, voice, 3-track tape, projections \u2013 1964\n- \"Balances\", amplified str qt (with db) \u2013 1964\n- \"Tropical Fish Opera\", four instruments \u2013 1962\n- \"Time Fields\", sextet \u2013 1962 (Pacifica Directors Award, 1963)\n- \"Traversals\", tape \u2013 1961\n- \"Kronos\", tape composition (approx 15 minutes) \u2013 1962\n- \"Kore\", tape \u2013 1961\n- \"Four Sanskrit Hymns\", four singers, four cellos, double bass, harp, piano, celesta, three percussionists, tape \u2013 1961\n\n## Recordings\n\n[edit]- Various works included on the DVD published with the book in David Bernstein's\n*The San Francisco Tape Music Center: 1960s counterculture and the avant-garde*, ISBN 9780520248922 (2008, University of California Press) *Desert Ambulance*(2005, Locust 70)*Worldfood*(2004, Locust 55)*Music from Mills*, an anthology which contains a short excerpt from his \"Audition\" (1986, Mills MC 001)*Songs from Being of the Sun*remastered archival (1973) reel-to-reel recordings of Ram\u00f3n Sender Baray\u00f3n and Alicia Bay Laurel performing songs, chants and improvisations from their book, Being of the Sun.

Most of his music calls for a computer part, or live electronic processing; his oeuvre utilizes many of the important technological breakthroughs in the history of the genre.\n\n## Early career\n\n[edit]Subotnick was born in Los Angeles, California, and graduated from the University of Denver. In the early 1960s, Subotnick taught at Mills College and with Ramon Sender, he co-founded the San Francisco Tape Music Center. During this period he also collaborated with Anna Halprin on two works (*the 3 legged stool* and *Parades and Changes*) and acted as music director of the Actors Workshop.\n\nIn 1966 Subotnick was instrumental in getting a Rockefeller Grant to join the Tape Center with the Mills Chamber Players (a chamber group at Mills College with performers Nate Rubin (violin); Bonnie Hampton (cello); Naomi Sparrow (piano) and Subotnick on clarinet). The grant required that the Tape Center relocate to a host institution that became Mills College. Subotnick, however, did not stay with the move, but went to New York with the Actor's Workshop to become the first music director of the Lincoln Center Rep Company in the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. Along with Len Lye, he became an artist in residence at the newly formed Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. The School of the Arts provided him with a studio and a Buchla Synthesizer (now at the Library of Congress). He then helped to develop the Electric Circus and the Electric Ear, and became their artistic director. At the same time he created *Silver Apples of the Moon*, *The Wild Bull*, and *Touch*.\n\n*Silver Apples of the Moon*\n\n[edit]Early electronic music was made using wave generators and tape-manipulated sounds. Subotnick was among the first composers to work with electronic instrument designer Don Buchla. Buchla's modular voltage-controlled synthesizer, which he called the Electric Music Box and which was constructed partly based on suggestions by Subotnick and Sender,[6] was both more flexible and easier to use, and its sequencing ability was integral to Subotnick's music.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a time when much United States' academic \"avant-gardist\" electronic music was highly abstract, (largely concerned with pitch and timbre, where (metric) rhythm might be an afterthought or of no consequence, and simple patterned structures were largely avoided), Subotnick broke with this direction by including sections with metric rhythms \u2013 those based on pulses and beats. Both *Silver Apples of the Moon* and 1968's *The Wild Bull* (another Nonesuch-commissioned work for tape; they have since been combined on a Wergo CD[7]) have been choreographed by dance companies around the world.\n\nIn 1969 Subotnick was invited to be part of a team of artists to move to Los Angeles to plan a new school. Mel Powell as Dean, Subotnick as Associate Dean, and a team of four other pairs of artists carved out a new path of music education and created the now famous California Institute of the Arts. Subotnick remained Associate Dean of the music school for 4 years and then, resigning from that position, became the head of the composition program where, a few years later, he created a new media program that introduced interactive technology and multimedia into the curriculum. In 1978 Subotnick, with Roger Reynolds and Bernard Rands, produced 5 annual internationally acclaimed new music festivals.[8]\n\n## Approach to music\n\n[edit]Where previous electronic music had used non-traditional structures, Subotnick's electronic compositions are structured more like the classical music for acoustic instruments with which audiences are familiar, but with nontraditional timbres and pitch manipulations no orchestra could produce. He has also written for acoustic instruments, and he has studied with Darius Milhaud and Leon Kirchner at Mills College in Oakland, California.\n\nIn addition to music in the electronic medium, Subotnick has written for symphony orchestra, chamber ensembles, theater and multimedia productions. His \"staged tone poem\u201d *The Double Life of Amphibians*, a collaboration with director Lee Breuer and visual artist Irving Petlin, utilizing live interaction between singers, instrumentalists and computer, was premiered at the 1984 Olympics Arts Festival in Los Angeles.\n\nThe concert version of *Jacob\u2019s Room*, a mono drama commissioned by Betty Freeman for the Kronos Quartet and singer Joan La Barbara, received its premiere in San Francisco in 1985. Jacob's Room, Subotnick's multimedia opera chamber opera (directed by Herbert Blau with video imagery by Steina and Woody Vasulka, featuring Joan La Barbara), received its premiere in Philadelphia in April 1993 under the auspices of The American Music Theater Festival. *The Key To Songs*, for chamber orchestra and computer, was premiered at the 1985 Aspen Music Festival. *Return*, commissioned to celebrate the return of Halley's Comet, premiered with an accompanying sky show in the planetarium of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles in 1986. Subotnick's recent works\u2014among them *Jacob's Room*, *The Key to Songs*, *Hunger*, *In Two Worlds*, *And the Butterflies Begin to Sing* and *A Desert Flowers*\u2014utilize computerized sound generation, specially designed software Interactor and \"intelligent\" computer controls which allow the performers to interact with the computer technology.[9]\n\n*All My Hummingbirds Have Alibis* (1994) was an interactive concert work and a CD-ROM (perhaps the first of its kind), *Making Music* (1995), *Making More Music* (1998) were his first works for children, and an interactive 'Media Poem', *Intimate Immensity*, premiered at the Lincoln Center Festival in NY (1997). The European premiere (1998) was in Karlsruhe, Germany. A string quartet with CDROM, *Echoes from the Silent Call of Girona* (1998), was premiered in Los Angeles by Southwest Chamber Music.\n\nSubotnick was commissioned to complete a larger version of the opera, *Jacobs Room*. This premiered in 2010 at the Bregenz Festival in Austria.\n\nSubotnick is developing tools for young children to create music. He has authored a series of six CDROMs for children, mounted a children's website and he is developing a related school program. Subotnick's Pitch Painter for iPad and iPhone (not available on App Store) is a musical finger painting app which presents a new intuitive way for kids to create music.\n\nSubotnick is working with the Library of Congress as they are preparing an archival presentation of his electronic works. He tours extensively throughout the U.S. and Europe as a lecturer and composer\/performer. Morton Subotnick is published by Schott Music. Students of his include Ingram Marshall, Mark Coniglio, Carl Stone, Rhys Chatham, Charlemagne Palestine, Ann Millikan, Nicholas Frances Chase, Brian Evans, Julia Stilman-Lasansky, John King, Lois V Vierk, Betty Ann Wong, and Jeremy Zuckerman.\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]Subotnick is married to Joan La Barbara, a singer and composer. Subotnick's older son, Steven Subotnick, is an animator; his younger son, Jacob Subotnick, is a sound designer and his daughter, Tamara Winer, is a psychiatric social worker.\n\n## Awards\n\n[edit]- Guggenheim Fellowship\n- Rockefeller Grants (3)\n- Meet the Composer (2)\n- American Academy of Arts and Letters Composer Award\n- Brandies Award\n- Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst K\u00fcnstlerprogramm (DAAD), Composer in Residence in Berlin\n- Lifetime Achievement Award (SEAMUS at Dartmouth)\n- ASCAP: John Cage Award\n- ACO: Lifetime Achievement\n- Honorary Doctorate from the California Institute of the Arts\n\n## Selected works\n\n[edit]*Sonata*for viola and piano (1959\u201360)[11]*Silver Apples of the Moon*(National Recording Registry inductee) (1967)[12]*The Wild Bull*(1968)*Touch*(1969)*Sidewinder*(1971)*Four Butterflies*(1973)*Until Spring*(1975)*A Sky of Cloudless Sulfur*(1978)*Axolotl*(1981)*A Fluttering of Wings*(1981)*An Arsenal of Defense*for solo viola and \"electronic ghost score\" (1982)*Trembling*(1983)*The Key to Songs*(1985)*Jacob's Room*(1986)*and the butterflies begin to sing*(1988)*All My Hummingbirds Have Alibis*(1991)*Echoes from the Silent Call of Girona*(1998)*Gestures*(1999\u20132001)*Then Now and Forever*(2008)*The Other Piano*(2007)*Jacob's Room Opera*(2010)*From Silver Apples of the Moon to a Sky of Cloudless Sulphur*(2009 \u2013 2013)*Jacob's Room Monodrama*(2013)\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Meet the 'founding father' of electronica\".*Bbc.com*.

The first Sonics concert of December 1961 consisted of original tape compositions by Oliveros, Sender, Terry Riley and Philip Winsor as well as a collaborative live improvisations.[6][7] The sixth and last concert of the series took place on June 11, 1962.[8]\n\n### Activities\n\n[edit]The premiere of Terry Riley's seminal minimalist composition *In C* was performed at (and organized by) the SFTMC on November 4 and 6, 1964. It was performed by Riley, Steve Reich, Jon Gibson, Pauline Oliveros, Stuart Dempster, Morton Subotnick, Warner Jepson and others, while Tony Martin operated the light show or \"visual environment\".\n\nThe SFTMC members, particularly Morton Subotnick, were instrumental in the creation of the Buchla analog modular synthesizer.\n\n### Later years\n\n[edit]Over the course of four years, the SFTMC changed locations twice, first to 1537 Jones Street and then to 321 Divisadero Street, before the Rockefeller Foundation awarded a $200,000 grant to Mills College to bring the SFTMC to Mills and merge it with the Mills Performing Group, where it eventually became the Mills Tape Music Center. Pauline Oliveros, Tony Martin and William Maginnis collectively served as directors for the new center, which is now the Center for Contemporary Music (CCM).[9][10]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**Bernstein, David W.

She taught music at Mills College, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Oliveros authored books, formulated new music theories, and investigated new ways to focus attention on music including her concepts of \"deep listening\"[3] and \"sonic awareness\", drawing on metaphors from cybernetics.[4][5] She was an Eyebeam resident.\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]Pauline Oliveros was born in Houston, Texas, on May 30, 1932.[6] She was of Tejana descent.[7] She started to play music as early as kindergarten,[8] and at nine years of age she began to play the accordion, received from her mother, a pianist, because of its popularity in the 1940s.[8] She later went on to learn violin, piano, tuba, and French horn for grade school and college music. At the age of sixteen she resolved to become a composer.[9]\n\nOliveros arrived in California[ when?] and supported herself with a day job, and supplemented this by giving accordion lessons.\n\n[8]From there Oliveros went on to attend the University of Houston, studying with Willard A. Palmer. While attending the University of Houston, she was a member of the band program and helped form the Tau chapter of Tau Beta Sigma Honorary Band Sorority.\n\nShe earned a BFA in composition from San Francisco State College, where her teachers included composer Robert Erickson, with whom she had private lessons and who mentored her for six to seven years. During this period she met San Francisco-based musicians Terry Riley, Stuart Dempster, and Loren Rush, with whom she would later collaborate.[8][10]\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]When Oliveros turned 21, she obtained her first tape recorder, which led to her creating her own electroacoustic pieces.[10] Oliveros was one of the original members of the San Francisco Tape Music Center, which was an important resource for electronic music on the west coast of the United States during the 1960s.[11] The Center later moved to Mills College, with Oliveros serving as its first director; there it was renamed the Center for Contemporary Music.[12]\n\nOliveros often improvised with the *Expanded Instrument System*, an electronic signal processing system she designed, in her performances and recordings.[13] Oliveros held Honorary Doctorates in Music from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Mills College, and De Montfort University.\n\nIn 1967, Oliveros left Mills to take a position at the University of California, San Diego.[8] There, Oliveros met theoretical physicist and karate master Lester Ingber, with whom she collaborated in defining the attentional process as applied to music listening.[14] She also studied karate under Ingber, achieving black belt level. In 1973, Oliveros conducted studies at the university's one-year-old Center for Music Experiment; she served as the center's director from 1976 to 1979. In 1981, to escape creative constriction,[15] she left her tenured position at UCSD and relocated to upstate New York to become an independent composer, performer, and consultant.[16]\n\nIn 1987, Oliveros had the tuning of her accordion changed from equal temperament to just intonation.[17] She sings and plays the retuned accordion (without electronics) in the 1993 opera *Agamemnon*.\n\nOliveros was a member of Avatar Orchestra Metaverse, a global collaboration of composers, artists and musicians that approaches the virtual reality platform *Second Life* as an instrument itself.[18]\n\n## Deep listening\n\n[edit]In 1988, as a result of descending 14 feet (4.3 m) into the Dan Harpole underground cistern in Port Townsend, Washington, to make a recording, Oliveros coined the term \"deep listening\"[8]\u2014a pun that blossomed into \"an aesthetic...designed to inspire both trained and untrained performers to practice the art of listening and responding to environmental conditions in solo and ensemble situations\".[19] Stuart Dempster, Oliveros and Panaiotis then formed the Deep Listening Band, and deep listening became a program of the Pauline Oliveros Foundation, founded in 1985. The Deep Listening program includes annual listening retreats in Europe, New Mexico and in upstate New York, as well as apprenticeship and certification programs. The Pauline Oliveros Foundation changed its name to Deep Listening Institute, Ltd., in 2005. The Deep Listening Band, which included Oliveros, David Gamper (1947\u20132011) and Stuart Dempster, specializes in performing and recording in resonant or reverberant spaces such as caves, cathedrals and huge underground cisterns. They have collaborated with Ellen Fullman and her long-string instrument, as well as countless other musicians, dancers and performers. The Center for Deep Listening at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, initially under the direction of Tomie Hahn, is the steward of the former Deep Listening Institute. A celebratory concert was held on March 11, 2015, at the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic.[20]\n\n## Sonic awareness\n\n[edit]Heidi Von Gunden[21] names a new musical theory developed by Oliveros, \"sonic awareness\", and describes it as \"the ability to consciously focus attention upon environmental and musical sound\", requiring \"continual alertness and an inclination to be always listening\" and which she describes as comparable to John Berger's concept of visual consciousness (as in his *Ways of Seeing*).[22] Oliveros discusses this theory in the \"Introductions\" to her *Sonic Meditations* and in articles. Von Gunden describes sonic awareness as \"a synthesis of the psychology of consciousness, the physiology of the martial arts, and the sociology of the feminist movement\",[23] and describes two ways of processing information, \"attention and awareness\",[23] or focal attention and global attention, which may be represented by a dot and circle, respectively, a symbol Oliveros commonly employs in compositions such as *Rose Moon* (1977) and *El Rilicario de los Animales* (1979).[23] (The titles of Oliveros' pieces *Rose Moon* and *Rose Mountain* refer to her romantic partner Linda Montano having gone by Rose Mountain at one time.[24]) Later this representation was expanded, with the symbol quartered and the quarters representing \"actively making sound\", \"actually imagining sound\", \"listening to present sound\" and \"remembering past sound\", with this model used in *Sonic Meditations*.[25] Practice of the theory creates \"complex sound masses possessing a strong tonal center\".[26]\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]Oliveros was openly lesbian.[27] In 1975 Oliveros met her eventual partner, performance artist Linda Montano.[28] The titles of Oliveros' pieces *Rose Moon* and *Rose Mountain* refer to Montano having gone by Rose Mountain at one time.[24] In her later years, Oliveros developed a 32-year romantic partnership and creative collaboration with sound artist IONE (Carole Lewis).[29] The couple worked together on several major musical theatre productions, dance operas, and films.[30] Sound artist Maria Chavez, a friend and mentee of Pauline, describes Pauline and Ione: \"when you saw them together, you saw love.\"[7]\n\nOliveros was also a patron of Soundart Radio in Dartington, Devon, England.\n\n## Death\n\n[edit]She died in 2016 in Kingston, New York.[6]\n\n## Awards and honors\n\n[edit]- 1994 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award\n[31] - 2007, Resounding Vision Award from Nameless Sound\n- 2009, recipient of the William Schuman Award, from Columbia University School of the Arts\n- 2012, John Cage Award from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts\n[31] - In 2025, Long Beach Opera dedicated its entire season to the works of Pauline Oliveros, reflecting her growing posthumous influence and recognition as a pioneering composer and innovator in experimental music.\n[32]\n\n## Notable works\n\n[edit]*Sonic Meditations*: \"Teach Yourself to Fly\", etc.*Sound Patterns*for mixed chorus (1961), awarded the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in 1962, available on*Extended Voices*(Odyssey 32 16) 0156 and*20th Century Choral Music*(Ars Nova AN-1005)*I of IV*, included in the collection*New Sounds in Electronic Music*, published by Odyssey Records, 1967- Music for Annie Sprinkle's\n*The Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop\u2014Or How To Be A Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps*(1992) *Theater of Substitution*series (1975\u2013?).

On 24 July, the Belgian government had announced that if war came it would uphold its neutrality. The Belgian government mobilised its armed forces on 31 July and a state of heightened alert (*Kriegsgefahr*) was proclaimed in Germany. On 2 August, the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium, demanding passage through the country and German forces invaded Luxembourg. Two days later, the Belgian government refused the German demands and the British government guaranteed military support to Belgium. The German government declared war on Belgium on 4 August; German troops crossed the border and began the Battle of Li\u00e8ge.\n\nGerman military operations in Belgium were intended to bring the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Armies into positions in Belgium from which they could invade France, which, after the fall of Li\u00e8ge on 7 August, led to sieges of Belgian fortresses along the river Meuse at Namur and the surrender of the last forts (16\u201317 August). The government abandoned the capital, Brussels, on 17 August and after fighting on the Gete river, the Belgian field army withdrew westwards to the National Redoubt at Antwerp on 19 August. Brussels was occupied the following day and the siege of Namur began on 21 August.\n\nAfter the Battle of Mons and the Battle of Charleroi, the bulk of the German armies in Belgium marched south into France, leaving small forces to garrison Brussels and the Belgian railways. The III Reserve Corps advanced to the fortified zone around Antwerp and a division of the IV Reserve Corps took over in Brussels. The Belgian field army made several sorties from Antwerp in late August and September to harass German communications and to assist the French and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) by keeping German troops in Belgium. German troop withdrawals to reinforce the main armies in France were postponed to repulse a Belgian sortie from 9 to 13 September and a German corps in transit was retained in Belgium for several days. Belgian resistance and German fear of francs-tireurs led the Germans to implement a policy of terror (*schrecklichkeit*) against Belgian civilians soon after the invasion, in which massacres, executions, hostage-taking and the burning of towns and villages took place and became known as the Rape of Belgium.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Frontiers ended, the French armies in the north and the BEF began the Great Retreat into France (24 August \u2013 28 September), the Belgian army and small detachments of French and British troops fought in Belgium against German cavalry and *J\u00e4ger* (light infantry). On 27 August, a squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) flew to Ostend, to conduct air reconnaissance between Bruges, Ghent and Ypres. Royal Marines landed in France on 19 to 20 September and began scouting unoccupied Belgium in motor cars; an RNAS Armoured Car Section was created by fitting vehicles with bulletproof steel. On 2 October, the Marine Brigade of the Royal Naval Division was moved to Antwerp, followed by the rest of the division on 6 October. From 6 to 7 October, the 7th Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division landed at Zeebrugge and naval forces collected at Dover were formed into the Dover Patrol, to operate in the Channel and off the French\u2013Belgian coast. Despite minor British reinforcement, the siege of Antwerp ended when its defensive ring of forts was destroyed by German super-heavy artillery. The city was abandoned on 9 October and Allied forces withdrew to West Flanders.\n\nAt the end of the Great Retreat, the Race to the Sea (17 September \u2013 19 October) began, a period of reciprocal attempts by German and Franco-British forces to outflank each other, extending the front line northwards from the Aisne, into Picardy, Artois, and Flanders. Military operations in Belgium also moved westwards as the Belgian army withdrew from Antwerp to the area close to the border with France. The Belgian army fought the defensive Battle of the Yser (16\u201331 October) from Nieuwpoort (Nieuport) south to Diksmuide (Dixmude), as the German 4th Army attacked westwards and French, British, and some Belgian troops fought the First Battle of Ypres (19 October \u2013 22 November) against the German 4th and 6th Armies. By November 1914, most of Belgium was under German occupation and Allied naval blockade. A German military administration was established on 26 August 1914, to rule through the pre-war Belgian administrative system, overseen by a small group of German officers and officials. Belgium was divided into administrative zones, the General Government of Brussels and its hinterland; a second zone, under the 4th Army, including Ghent and Antwerp and a third zone under the German Navy along the coastline. The German occupation lasted until late 1918.\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]### Belgian neutrality\n\n[edit]The neutrality of Belgium had been established by the European Great Powers in the London Conference of 1830. The Treaty of London (1839) recognised Belgian independence and neutrality from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands after the Belgian revolution.[1] Until 1911, Belgian strategic analysis anticipated that if war came, the Germans would attack France across the Franco-German border and trap the French armies against the Belgian frontier, as they had done in 1870. British and French guarantees of Belgian independence were made before 1914 but the possibility of landings in Antwerp was floated by the British military attach\u00e9 in 1906 and 1911, which led the Belgians to suspect that the British had come to see Belgian neutrality as a matter of British diplomatic and military advantage, rather than as an end in itself. The Agadir Crisis (1911) left the Belgian government in little doubt as to the risk of a European war and an invasion of Belgium by Germany.[2]\n\nIn September 1911, a government meeting concluded that Belgium must be prepared to resist a German invasion, to avoid accusations of collusion by the British and French governments. Britain, France and the Netherlands were also to continue to be treated as potential enemies.[2] In 1913 and 1914, the Germans made inquiries to the Belgian military attach\u00e9 in Berlin, about the passage of German military forces through Belgium. If invaded, Belgium would need foreign help but would not treat foreign powers as allies or form objectives beyond the maintenance of Belgian independence. Neutrality forced the Belgian government into a strategy of military independence, based on a rearmament programme begun in 1909, which was expected to be complete in 1926. The Belgian plan was to have three army corps, to reduce the numerical advantage of the German armies over the French, intended to deter a German invasion.[3]\n\nConscription was introduced in 1909 but with a reduction in the term of service to fifteen months; the Agadir Crisis made the government continue its preparations but until 1913, the size of the army was not fixed as a proportion of the population. The annual conscription of 13,300 recruits was increased to 33,000 to accumulate the trained manpower for a field army of 180,000 men. Older men would continue to serve as garrison troops and by 1926 about 340,000 men would be available. Implementation of the new scheme had disrupted the old one but had not yet become effective by 1914. During the crisis over the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, regiments were divided and eight conscription classes were incorporated into the army to provide 117,000 men for the field army and 200,000 fortress troops. The Belgian army planned a defence based on interior lines, rather than concentrating the army on the border against a particular threat. Belgian defences were to be based on a National Redoubt at Antwerp, with the field army massed in the centre of the country 60 km (37 mi) from the frontier, ready to manoeuvre to delay an invasion, while the frontiers were protected by the fortified regions of Li\u00e8ge and Namur.[3] The German invasion of Belgium on 4 August 1914, in violation of Article VII of the Treaty of London was the *casus belli*, the reason given by the British government, for declaring war on Germany.[4]\n\n### War plans\n\n[edit]#### Belgian defensive plans\n\n[edit]Belgian military planning was based on the assumption that other powers would oust an invader but the likelihood of a German invasion did not lead to France and Britain being seen as allies or for the Belgian government to do more than protect its independence. The Anglo-French Entente (1904) had led the Belgians to perceive that the British attitude to Belgium had changed and that it was now seen as a protectorate. A Belgian General Staff was formed in 1910 but the *Chef d'\u00c9tat-Major G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Arm\u00e9e*, Lieutenant-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Harry Jungbluth was retired on 30 June 1912 and not replaced until May 1914 by Lieutenant-General Chevalier Antonin de Selliers de Moranville. Moranville began planning for the concentration of the army and met railway officials on 29 July.[5]\n\nBelgian troops were to be massed in central Belgium, in front of the National Redoubt at Antwerp ready to face any border, while the fortified position of Li\u00e8ge and fortified position of Namur were left to secure the frontiers. On mobilisation, the King became Commander-in-Chief and chose where the army was to concentrate. Amid the disruption of the new rearmament plan the disorganised and poorly trained Belgian conscripts would benefit from a central position to delay contact with an invader. The army would also need fortifications for defence but these had been built on the frontier. Another school of thought wanted a return to a frontier deployment, in line with French theories of the offensive. The Belgian plan that emerged was a compromise in which the field army concentrated behind the Gete river with two divisions forward at Li\u00e8ge and Namur.[5]\n\n#### Germany: Schlieffen\u2013Moltke Plan\n\n[edit]German strategy had given priority to offensive operations against France and a defensive posture against Russia since 1891. German planning was determined by numerical inferiority, the speed of mobilisation and concentration and the effect of the vast increase of the power of modern weapons. Frontal attacks were expected to be costly and protracted, leading to limited success, particularly after the French and Russians modernised their fortifications on the frontiers with Germany. Alfred von Schlieffen, Chief of the Imperial German General Staff (*Oberste Heeresleitung*, OHL, the German army high command) from 1891 to 1906, devised a plan to evade the French frontier fortifications with an offensive on the northern flank, which would have a local numerical superiority and obtain rapidly a decisive victory. By 1898\u20131899, such a manoeuvre was intended swiftly to pass between Antwerp and Namur and threaten Paris from the north.[6]\n\nHelmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and was less certain that the French would conform to German assumptions. Moltke adapted the deployment and concentration plan to accommodate an attack in the centre or an enveloping attack from both flanks as variants, by adding divisions to the left (southern) flank opposite the French frontier, from the c. 1,700,000 men expected to be mobilised in the *Westheer* (Western Army). The main German force would still advance through Belgium and attack southwards into France, the French armies would be enveloped on the left and pressed back over the Meuse, Aisne, Somme, Oise, Marne, and Seine, by short, rapid attacks, unable to withdraw into central France. The French would either be annihilated or the manoeuvre from the north would create conditions for victory in the centre or in Lorraine, on the common border.[7]\n\nA corollary to the emphasis on the Western Front was lack of troops for the Eastern Front against Russia. In the east the Germans planned a defensive strategy and relied on the 8th Army to defend East Prussia and on the Austro-Hungarian Army (*Landstreitkr\u00e4fte \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns*\/*Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1ri \u00e9s Kir\u00e1lyi Hadsereg*) to divert the Russians from eastern Germany with offensives in Galicia, while France was being crushed. Divisions from the German army in the west (*Westheer*) would be moved eastwards to deal with the Russians as soon as a breathing-space was gained against the French.[8]\n\n#### France: Plan XVII\n\n[edit]Under Plan XVII the French peacetime army was to form five field armies, with a group of reserve divisions attached to each army and a group of reserve divisions on each flank, a military force of c. 2,000,000 men. The armies were to concentrate opposite the German frontier around \u00c9pinal, Nancy and Verdun\u2013Mezi\u00e8res, with an army in reserve around Ste. M\u00e9n\u00e9hould and Commercy. Since 1871, railway building had given the French General Staff sixteen lines to the German frontier, against thirteen available to the German army and the French could afford to wait until German intentions were clear. The French deployment was intended to be ready for a German offensive in Lorraine or through Belgium. It was anticipated that the Germans would use reserve troops but also expected that a large German army would be mobilised on the border with Russia, leaving the western army with sufficient troops only to advance through Belgium south of the Meuse and Sambre rivers. French intelligence had obtained a 1905 map exercise of the German general staff, in which German troops had gone no further north than Namur and assumed that plans to besiege Belgian forts were a defensive measure against the Belgian army.[9]\n\nA German attack from south-eastern Belgium towards M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and a possible offensive from Lorraine towards Verdun, Nancy and St. Di\u00e9 was anticipated; the plan was an evolution from Plan XVI and made more provision for the possibility of a German offensive from the north through Belgium. The First, Second and Third armies were to concentrate between \u00c9pinal and Verdun opposite Alsace and Lorraine, the Fifth Army was to assemble from Montm\u00e9dy to Sedan and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and the Fourth Army was to be held back west of Verdun, ready to move east to attack the southern flank of a German invasion through Belgium or southwards against the northern flank of an attack through Lorraine. No formal provision was made for combined operations with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but joint arrangements had been made and in 1911 during the Second Moroccan Crisis, the French had been told that six British divisions could be expected to operate around Maubeuge.[10]\n\n## Outbreak of war\n\n[edit]On 28 June the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated and on 5 July the Kaiser promised \"the full support of Germany\" if Austria-Hungary took action against Serbia. On 23 July the Austro-Hungarian Government sent an ultimatum to Serbia and next day the British Foreign Minister Sir Edward Grey proposed a conference to avert a war and the Belgian Government issued a declaration that Belgium would defend its neutrality \"whatever the consequences\". On 25 July the Serbian Government ordered mobilisation and on 26 July, the Austro-Hungarian Government ordered partial mobilisation against Serbia. The French and Italian governments accepted British proposals for a conference on 27 July but the next day Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and the German government rejected the British proposal for a conference. On 29 July the Russian government ordered partial mobilisation against Austria-Hungary as hostilities commenced between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. The German government made proposals to secure British neutrality; the Admiralty sent a *Warning Telegram* to the Fleets and the War Office ordered the *Precautionary Period*. On 30 July the British government rejected German proposals for British neutrality and next day the Austro-Hungarian and Russian governments ordered full mobilisation.[11]\n\nAt midnight on 31 July\/1 August the German government sent an ultimatum to Russia and announced a state of *\"Kriegsgefahr\"* during the day; the Ottoman government ordered mobilisation and the London Stock Exchange closed. On 1 August the British government ordered the mobilisation of the Navy, the German government ordered general mobilisation and declared war on Russia. Hostilities commenced on the Polish frontier, the French government ordered general mobilisation and next day the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium demanding passage through Belgian territory, as German troops crossed the frontier of Luxembourg. Military operations began on the French frontier, Libau was bombarded by a German cruiser SMS *Augsburg* and the British government guaranteed naval protection for French coasts. On 3 August the Belgian Government refused German demands and the British government guaranteed military support to Belgium should the German army invade. Germany declared war on France, the British government ordered general mobilisation and Italy declared neutrality. On 4 August the British government sent an ultimatum to Germany and declared war on Germany at midnight on 4\/5 August Central European Time. Belgium severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Germany declared war on Belgium. German troops crossed the Belgian frontier and attacked Li\u00e8ge.[12]\n\n## Battles\n\n[edit]### Battle of Li\u00e8ge, 5\u201316 August\n\n[edit]The Battle of Li\u00e8ge was the primary engagement in the German invasion of Belgium and the first battle of World War I. The attack on the city began on 5 August and lasted until 16 August, when the last fort was surrendered. The German invasion led the British to declare war and the length of the siege may have delayed the German invasion of France by 4\u20135 days. Railways needed by the German armies in eastern Belgium were closed during the early part of the siege and by the morning of 17 August, the German 1st, 2nd and 3rd armies were free to resume their advance to the French frontier, yet German troops only appeared in strength before Namur on 20 August.[13] The Belgian field army withdrew from the Gete towards Antwerp from 18\u201320 August and Brussels was captured unopposed on 20 August. The siege of Li\u00e8ge had lasted for eleven days, rather than the two days anticipated by the Germans.[13]\n\nBelgian military operations in the east of the country had delayed German plans, which some writers claimed had been advantageous to the Franco-British forces in northern France and in Belgium.[13] Wolfgang F\u00f6rster wrote that the German timetable of deployment had required its armies to reach a line from Thionville to Sedan and Mons by the 22nd day of mobilisation (23 August), which was achieved ahead of schedule. In *Bulletin Belge des Sciences Militaires*, a four-day delay was claimed.[13] John Buchan wrote that \"The triumph was moral \u2013 an advertisement to the world that the ancient faiths of country and duty could still nerve the arm for battle, and that the German idol, for all its splendour, had feet of clay.\"[14] In 2007, Foley called the neutralisation of the Belgian defences at Li\u00e8ge sufficient to enable the German right wing to squeeze through, a small bump in the road for the Germans, who had mobilised in two weeks and were ready to invade France by 20 August.[15]\n\n### Battle of Halen, 12 August 1914\n\n[edit]The Battle of Halen (Haelen) was fought by mounted and dismounted cavalry and other forces on 12 August 1914 between German forces, led by Georg von der \n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Open Result 1\n# Western Front (World War I)\n\n\n| Western Front | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Part of the European theatre of World War I | |||||||\nClockwise from top left: Men of the Royal Irish Rifles, concentrated in the trench, right before going over the top on the First day on the Somme; British soldier carries a wounded comrade from the battlefield on the first day of the Somme; A young German soldier during the Battle of Ginchy; American infantry storming a German bunker; A German Gotha G.IV heavy bomber; American troops with Renault FT tanks moving in the Argonne Forest to the front line during the Meuse\u2013Argonne offensive | |||||||\n| |||||||\n| Belligerents | |||||||\n|\nUnited Kingdom and Empire\n| Austria-Hungary | ||||||\n| Commanders and leaders | |||||||\n| Strength | |||||||\n13,250,000[1] | |||||||\n| Casualties and losses | |||||||\n7,500,000\n|\n5,500,000\n|\n\nThe **Western Front** was one of the main theatres of war during World War I. Following the outbreak of war in August 1914, the German Army opened the Western Front by invading Luxembourg and Belgium, then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France. The German advance was halted with the Battle of the Marne. Following the Race to the Sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France, the position of which changed little except during early 1917 and again in 1918.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1917 there were several offensives along this front. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances. Entrenchments, machine gun emplacements, barbed wire, and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties during attacks and counter-attacks and no significant advances were made. Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun, in 1916, with a combined 700,000 casualties, the Battle of the Somme, also in 1916, with over a million casualties, and the Battle of Passchendaele, in 1917, with 487,000 casualties.[10][11]\n\nTo break the deadlock of the trench warfare on the Western Front, both sides tried new military technology, including poison gas, aircraft, and tanks. The adoption of better tactics and the cumulative weakening of the armies in the west led to the return of mobility in 1918. The German spring offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that ended the war of the Central Powers against Russia and Romania on the Eastern Front. Using short, intense \"hurricane\" bombardments and infiltration tactics, the German armies moved nearly 100 kilometres (60 miles) to the west, the deepest advance by either side since 1914, but the success was short-lived.\n\nThe unstoppable advance of the entente armies during the Hundred Days Offensive of 1918 caused a sudden collapse of the German armies and persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable. The German government surrendered in the Armistice of 11 November 1918, and the terms of peace were settled by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n\n## 1914\n\n[edit]### War plans \u2013 Battle of the Frontiers\n\n[edit]The Western Front was the place where the most powerful military forces in Europe, the German and French armies, met and where the First World War was decided.[12] At the outbreak of the war, the German Army, with seven field armies in the west and one in the east, executed a modified version of the Schlieffen Plan, bypassing French defenses along the common border by moving quickly through neutral Belgium, and then turning southwards to attack France and attempt to encircle the French Army and trap it on the German border.[13] Belgian neutrality had been guaranteed by Britain under the Treaty of London, 1839; this caused Britain to join the war at the expiration of its ultimatum at midnight on 4 August. Armies under German generals Alexander von Kluck and Karl von B\u00fclow attacked Belgium on 4 August 1914. Luxembourg had been occupied without opposition on 2 August. The first battle in Belgium was the Battle of Li\u00e8ge, a siege that lasted from 5\u201316 August. Li\u00e8ge was well fortified and surprised the German Army under B\u00fclow with its level of resistance. German heavy artillery was able to demolish the main forts within a few days.[14] Following the fall of Li\u00e8ge, most of the Belgian field army retreated to Antwerp, leaving the garrison of Namur isolated, with the Belgian capital, Brussels, falling to the Germans on 20 August. Although the German army bypassed Antwerp, it remained a threat to their flank. Another siege followed at Namur, lasting from about 20\u201323 August.[15]\n\nThe French deployed five armies on the frontier. The French Plan XVII was intended to bring about the capture of Alsace\u2013Lorraine.[16] On 7 August, the VII Corps attacked Alsace to capture Mulhouse and Colmar. The main offensive was launched on 14 August with the First and Second Armies attacking toward Sarrebourg-Morhange in Lorraine.[17] In keeping with the Schlieffen Plan, the Germans withdrew slowly while inflicting severe losses upon the French. The French Third and Fourth Armies advanced toward the Saar and attempted to capture Saarburg, attacking Briey and Neufchateau but were repulsed.[18] The French VII Corps captured Mulhouse after a brief engagement first on 7 August, and then again on 23 August, but German reserve forces engaged them in the Battle of Mulhouse and forced the French to retreat twice.[19]\n\nThe German Army swept through Belgium, executing civilians and razing villages. The application of \"collective responsibility\" against a civilian population further galvanised the entente. Newspapers condemned the German invasion, violence against civilians and destruction of property, which became known as the \"Rape of Belgium.\"[20][d] After marching through Belgium, Luxembourg and the Ardennes, the Germans advanced into northern France in late August, where they met the French Army, under Joseph Joffre, and the divisions of the British Expeditionary Force under Field Marshal Sir John French. A series of engagements known as the Battle of the Frontiers ensued, which included the Battle of Charleroi and the Battle of Mons. In the former battle the French Fifth Army was almost destroyed by the German 2nd and 3rd Armies and the latter delayed the German advance by a day. A general entente retreat followed, resulting in more clashes at the Battle of Le Cateau, the Siege of Maubeuge and the Battle of St. Quentin (also called the First Battle of Guise).[22]\n\n### First Battle of the Marne\n\n[edit]The German Army came within 70 km (43 mi) of Paris but at the First Battle of the Marne (6\u201312 September), French and British troops were able to force a German retreat by exploiting a gap which appeared between the 1st and 2nd Armies, ending the German advance into France.[23] The German Army retreated north of the Aisne and dug in there, establishing the beginnings of a static western front that was to last for the next three years. Following this German retirement, the opposing forces made reciprocal outflanking manoeuvres, known as the Race to the Sea and quickly extended their trench systems from the Swiss frontier to the North Sea.[24] The territory occupied by Germany held 64 percent of French pig-iron production, 24 percent of its steel manufacturing and 40 percent of the coal industry \u2013 dealing a serious blow to French industry.[25]\n\nOn the entente side (those countries opposing the German alliance), the final lines were occupied with the armies of each nation defending a part of the front. From the coast in the north, the primary forces were from Belgium, the British Empire and then France. Following the Battle of the Yser in October, the Belgian army controlled a 35 km (22 mi) length of West Flanders along the coast, known as the Yser Front, along the Yser and the Ieperlee from Nieuwpoort to Boezinge.[26] Meanwhile, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) occupied a position on the flank, having occupied a more central position.[27]\n\n### First Battle of Ypres\n\n[edit]From 19 October until 22 November, the German forces made their final breakthrough attempt of 1914 during the First Battle of Ypres, which ended in a mutually-costly stalemate.[28] After the battle, Erich von Falkenhayn judged that it was no longer possible for Germany to win the war by purely military means and on 18 November 1914 he called for a diplomatic solution. The Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg; *Generalfeldmarschall* Paul von Hindenburg, commanding *Ober Ost* (Eastern Front high command); and his deputy, Erich Ludendorff, continued to believe that victory was achievable through decisive battles. During the Lodz offensive in Poland (11\u201325 November), Falkenhayn hoped that the Russians would be made amenable to peace overtures. In his discussions with Bethmann Hollweg, Falkenhayn viewed Germany and Russia as having no insoluble conflict and that the real enemies of Germany were France and Britain. A peace with only a few annexations of territory also seemed possible with France and that with Russia and France out of the war by negotiated settlements, Germany could concentrate on Britain and fight a long war with the resources of Europe at its disposal. Hindenburg and Ludendorff continued to believe that Russia could be defeated by a series of battles which cumulatively would have a decisive effect, after which Germany could finish off France and Britain.[29]\n\n### Trench warfare\n\n[edit]Trench warfare in 1914, while not new, quickly improved and provided a very high degree of defense. According to two prominent historians:\n\nTrenches were longer, deeper, and better defended by steel, concrete, and barbed wire than ever before. They were far stronger and more effective than chains of forts, for they formed a continuous network, sometimes with four or five parallel lines linked by interfacings. They were dug far below the surface of the earth out of reach of the heaviest artillery.... Grand battles with the old maneuvers were out of the question. Only by bombardment, sapping, and assault could the enemy be shaken, and such operations had to be conducted on an immense scale to produce appreciable results. Indeed, it is questionable whether the German lines in France could ever have been broken if the Germans had not wasted their resources in unsuccessful assaults, and the blockade by sea had not gradually cut off their supplies. In such warfare no single general could strike a blow that would make him immortal; the \"glory of fighting\" sank down into the dirt and mire of trenches and dugouts.\n\n[30]\n\n## 1915\n\n[edit]Between the coast and the Vosges was a westward bulge in the trench line, named the Noyon salient after the French town at the maximum point of the German advance near Compi\u00e8gne. Joffre's plan for 1915 was to attack the salient on both flanks to cut it off.[31] The Fourth Army had attacked in Champagne from 20 December 1914 \u2013 17 March 1915 but the French were not able to attack in Artois at the same time. The Tenth Army formed the northern attack force and was to attack eastwards into the Douai plain on a 16 km (9.9 mi) front between Loos and Arras.[32] On 10 March, as part of the larger offensive in the Artois region, the British Army fought the Battle of Neuve Chapelle to capture Aubers Ridge. The assault was made by four divisions on a 2 mi (3.2 km) front. Preceded by a hurricane bombardment lasting only 35 minutes, the village was captured within four hours. The advance then slowed because of supply and communication difficulties. The Germans brought up reserves and counterattacked, forestalling the attempt to capture the ridge. Since the British had used about a third of their artillery ammunition, General Sir John French blamed the failure on the Shell Crisis of 1915, despite the early success.[33][34]\n\n### Gas warfare\n\n[edit]All sides had signed the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which prohibited the use of chemical weapons in warfare. In 1914, there had been small-scale attempts by both the French and Germans to use various tear gases, which were not strictly prohibited by the early treaties but which were also ineffective.[35] The first use of more lethal chemical weapons on the Western Front was against the French near the Belgian town of Ypres. The Germans had already deployed gas against the Russians in the east at the Battle of Humin-Bolim\u00f3w.[36]\n\nDespite the German plans to maintain the stalemate with the French and British, Albrecht, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, commander of the 4th Army planned an offensive at Ypres, site of the First Battle of Ypres in November 1914. The Second Battle of Ypres, April 1915, was intended to divert attention from offensives in the Eastern Front and disrupt Franco-British planning. After a two-day bombardment, the Germans released a lethal cloud of 168 long tons (171 t) of chlorine onto the battlefield. Though primarily a powerful irritant, it can asphyxiate in high concentrations or prolonged exposure. Being heavier than air, the gas crept across no man's land and drifted into the French trenches.[37] The green-yellow cloud started killing some defenders and those in the rear fled in panic, creating an undefended 3.7-mile (6 km) gap in the entente line. The Germans were unprepared for the level of their success and lacked sufficient reserves to exploit the opening. Canadian troops on the right drew back their left flank and halted the German advance.[38] The gas attack was repeated two days later and caused a 3.1 mi (5 km) withdrawal of the Franco-British line but the opportunity had been lost.[39]\n\nThe success of this attack would not be repeated, as the entente countered by introducing gas masks and other countermeasures. An example of the success of these measures came a year later, on 27 April in the Gas attacks at Hulluch 40 km (25 mi) to the south of Ypres, where the 16th (Irish) Division withstood several German gas attacks.[40] The British retaliated, developing their own chlorine gas and using it at the Battle of Loos in September 1915. Fickle winds and inexperience led to more British casualties from the gas than German.[41] French, British and German forces all escalated the use of gas attacks through the rest of the war, developing the more deadly phosgene gas in 1915, then the infamous mustard gas in 1917, which could linger for days and could kill slowly and painfully. Countermeasures also improved and the stalemate continued.[42]\n\n### Air warfare\n\n[edit]Specialised aeroplanes for aerial combat were introduced in 1915. Aircraft were already in use for scouting and on 1 April, the French pilot Roland Garros became the first to shoot down an enemy aircraft by using a machine-gun that shot forward through the propeller blades. This was achieved by crudely reinforcing the blades to deflect bullets.[43] Several weeks later Garros force-landed behind German lines. His aeroplane was captured and sent to Dutch engineer Anthony Fokker, who soon produced a significant improvement, the interrupter gear, in which the machine gun is synchronised with the propeller so it fires in the intervals when the blades of the propeller are out of the line of fire. This advance was quickly ushered into service, in the Fokker E.I (*Eindecker*, or monoplane, Mark 1), the first single seat fighter aircraft to combine a reasonable maximum speed with an effective armament. Max Immelmann scored the first confirmed kill in an *Eindecker* on 1 August.[44] Both sides developed improved weapons, engines, airframes and materials, until the end of the war. It also inaugurated the cult of the ace, the most famous being Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron). Contrary to the myth, anti-aircraft fire claimed more kills than fighters.[45]\n\n### Spring offensive\n\n[edit]The final entente offensive of the spring was the Second Battle of Artois, an offensive to capture Vimy Ridge and advance into the Douai plain. The French Tenth Army attacked on 9 May after a six-day bombardment and advanced 5 kilometres (3 mi) to capture Vimy Ridge. German reinforcements counter-attacked and pushed the French back towards their starting points because French reserves had been held back and the success of the attack had come as a surprise. By 15 May the advance had been stopped, although the fighting continued until 18 June.[46] In May the German Army captured a French document at La Ville-aux-Bois describing a new system of defence. Rather than relying on a heavily fortified front line, the defence was to be arranged in a series of echelons. The front line would be a thinly manned series of outposts, reinforced by a series of strongpoints and a sheltered reserve. If a slope was available, troops were deployed along the rear side for protection. The defence became fully integrated with command of artillery at the divisional level. Members of the German high command viewed this new scheme with some favour and it later became the basis of an elastic defence in depth doctrine against entente attacks.[47][48]\n\nDuring the autumn of 1915, the \"Fokker Scourge\" began to have an effect on the battlefront as entente reconnaissance aircraft were nearly driven from the skies. These reconnaissance aircraft were used to direct gunnery and photograph enemy fortifications but now the entente were nearly blinded by German fighters.[49] However, the impact of German air superiority was diminished by their primarily defensive doctrine in which they tended to remain over their own lines, rather than fighting over entente held territory.[50]\n\n### Autumn offensive\n\n[edit]In September 1915 the entente launched another offensive, with the French Third Battle of Artois, Second Battle of Champagne and the British at Loos. The French had spent the summer preparing for this action, with the British assuming control of more of the front to release French troops for the attack. The bombardment, which had been carefully targeted by means of aerial photography,[51] began on 22 September. The main French assault was launched on 25 September and, at first, made good progress in spite of surviving wire entanglements and machine gun posts. Rather than retreating, the Germans adopted a new defence-in-depth scheme that consisted of a series of defensive zones and positions with a depth of up to 8.0 km (5 mi).[52]\n\nOn 25 September, the British began the Battle of Loos, part of the Third Battle of Artois, which was meant to supplement the larger Champagne attack. The attack was preceded by a four-day artillery bombardment of 250,000 shells and a release of 5,100 cylinders of chlorine gas.[53][54] The attack involved two corps in the main assault and two corps performing diversionary attacks at Ypres. The British suffered heavy losses, especially due to machine gun fire during the attack and made only limited gains before they ran out of shells. A renewal of the attack on 13 October fared little better.[55] In December, French was replaced by General Douglas Haig as commander of the British forces.[56]\n\n## 1916\n\n[edit]Falkenhayn believed that a breakthrough might no longer be possible and instead focused on forcing a French defeat by inflicting massive casualties.[57] His new goal was to \"bleed France white.\"[58] As such, he adopted two new strategies. The first was the use of unrestricted submarine warfare to cut off entente supplies arriving from overseas.[59] The second would be attacks against the French army intended to inflict maximum casualties; Falkenhayn planned to attack a position from which the French could not retreat, for reasons of strategy and national pride and thus trap the French. The town of Verdun was chosen for this because it was an important stronghold, surrounded by a ring of forts, that lay near the German lines and because it guarded the direct route to Paris.[60]\n\nFalkenhayn limited the size of the front to 5\u20136 kilometres (3\u20134 mi) to concentrate artillery firepower and to prevent a breakthrough from a counter-of\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Open Result 2\n# Armistice of 11 November 1918\n\n\nThe **Armistice of 11 November 1918** was the armistice that ended fighting on land, at sea, and in the air in World War I between the Entente and their last remaining opponent, Germany. It was signed in a railroad car in the Compi\u00e8gne Forest, near the town of Compi\u00e8gne. Previous armistices had been agreed with Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. It was concluded after the German government sent a message to American president Woodrow Wilson to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared \"Fourteen Points\", which later became the basis of the German surrender at the Paris Peace Conference, which took place the following year.\n\nAlso known as the **Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne** (French: *Armistice de Compi\u00e8gne*, German: *Waffenstillstand von Compi\u00e8gne*) from the town near the place where it was officially agreed to at 5:00 a.m. by the Allied Supreme Commander, French Marshal Ferdinand Foch,[1] it came into force at 11:00 a.m. Paris Time (11:00 UT) on 11 November 1918 and marked a victory for the Entente and a defeat for Germany, although not formally a surrender.\n\nThe actual terms, which were largely written by Foch, included the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front, the withdrawal of German forces from west of the Rhine, Entente occupation of the Rhineland and bridgeheads further east, the preservation of infrastructure, the surrender of aircraft, warships, and military materiel, the release of Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians, eventual reparations, no release of German prisoners and no relaxation of the naval blockade of Germany. The armistice was extended three times while negotiations continued on a peace treaty. The Treaty of Versailles, which was officially signed on 28 June 1919, took effect on 10 January 1920.\n\nFighting continued up until 11 a.m. UT on 11 November 1918, with 2,738 men dying on the last day of the war.[2]\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]### Deteriorating situation for the Germans\n\n[edit]The military situation for the Central Powers had been deteriorating rapidly since the Battle of Amiens at the beginning of August 1918, which precipitated a German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line and loss of the gains of the German spring offensive.[3] The Allied advance, later known as the Hundred Days Offensive, entered a new stage on 28 September, when a massive United States and French attack opened the Meuse\u2013Argonne offensive, while to the north, the British were poised to assault at the St Quentin Canal, threatening a giant pincer movement.[4]\n\nMeanwhile, the Ottoman Empire was close to exhaustion, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was in chaos, and on the Macedonian front, resistance by the Bulgarian Army had collapsed, leading to the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September.[5] With the collapse of Bulgaria, and Italian victory in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the road was open to an invasion of Germany from the south via Austria.[6] In Germany, chronic food shortages caused by the Allied blockade were increasingly leading to discontent and disorder.[7] Although morale on the German front line was reasonable, battlefield casualties, starvation rations and Spanish flu had caused a desperate shortage of manpower, and those recruits that were available were war-weary and disaffected.[8]\n\n### October 1918 telegrams and inter-Allied negotiations\n\n[edit]On 29 September 1918, the German Supreme Army Command at Imperial Army Headquarters at Spa in occupied Belgium, informed Emperor Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor, Count Georg von Hertling, that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless. Quartermaster General Erich Ludendorff claimed that he could not guarantee that the front would hold for another two hours. Stating that the collapse of Bulgaria meant that troops destined for the Western Front would have to be diverted there, and this had \"fundamentally changed the situation in view of the attacks being launched on the Western Front\", Ludendorff demanded a request be given to the Entente for an immediate ceasefire.[9] In addition, he recommended the acceptance of the main demands of US president Woodrow Wilson (the Fourteen Points) including putting the Imperial Government on a democratic footing, hoping for more favorable peace terms. This enabled him to save the face of the Imperial German Army and put the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences squarely into the hands of the democratic parties and the parliament. He expressed his view to officers of his staff on 1 October: \"They now must lie on the bed that they've made for us.\"[10]\n\nOn 3 October 1918, the liberal Prince Maximilian of Baden was appointed Chancellor of Germany,[11] replacing Georg von Hertling in order to negotiate an armistice.[12] After long conversations with the Kaiser and evaluations of the political and military situations in the Reich, by 5 October 1918 the German government sent a message to Wilson to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared \"Fourteen Points\". In the subsequent two exchanges, Wilson's allusions \"failed to convey the idea that the Kaiser's abdication was an essential condition for peace. The leading statesmen of the Reich were not yet ready to contemplate such a monstrous possibility.\"[13] As a precondition for negotiations, Wilson demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and the Kaiser's abdication, writing on 23 October: \"If the Government of the United States must deal with the military masters and the monarchical autocrats of Germany now, or if it is likely to have to deal with them later in regard to the international obligations of the German Empire, it must demand not peace negotiations but surrender.\"[14]\n\nIn late October 1918, Ludendorff, discovering that the Allies' proposed armistice terms were much harsher than he had anticipated, now demanded the resumption of the war which he himself had declared lost only one month earlier. Germany's position however had further weakened since that time. Desertions were on the increase and Germany's allies were all on the verge of capitulation. The Kaiser dismissed Ludendorff and replaced him with Lieutenant General Wilhelm Groener, who recommended that the government continue in its intentions to seek an armistice.\n\nOn 3 November 1918, Berlin was notified that both Turkey and Austria-Hungary had concluded armistices with the Allies. General von Gallwitz had described this eventuality as being \"decisive\" to the Chancellor in discussions some weeks before, as it would mean that Austrian territory would become a spring-board for an Allied attack on Germany from the south. Revolution broke out across Germany the following day, together with a mutiny in the German High Seas Fleet. On 5 November, the Allies agreed to take up negotiations for a truce.[15][16]\n\nThe latest note from Wilson was received in Berlin on 6 November 1918. That same day, the delegation led by Matthias Erzberger departed for France.[17] Aware that the refusal of the Kaiser to abdicate was a sticking-point in negotiations with the Allies as well as an impetus to revolution within Germany, Prince Max on his own authority announced that the Kaiser had abdicated and handed over power to Friedrich Ebert of the Social Democratic Party on 9 November. The same day, Philipp Scheidemann, also a Social Democrat, declared Germany a republic.[18]\n\nWhilst the Germans sought negotiations along the lines of Wilson's 14 points, the French, British and Italian governments had no desire to accept them and President Wilson's subsequent unilateral promises. For example, they assumed that the de-militarization suggested by Wilson would be limited to the Central Powers. There were also contradictions with their post-War plans that did not include a consistent implementation of the ideal of national self-determination.[19] As Czernin points out:\n\nThe Allied statesmen were faced with a problem: so far they had considered the \"fourteen commandments\" as a piece of clever and effective American propaganda, designed primarily to undermine the fighting spirit of the Central Powers, and to bolster the morale of the lesser Allies. Now, suddenly, the whole peace structure was supposed to be built up on that set of \"vague principles\", most of which seemed to them thoroughly unrealistic, and some of which, if they were to be seriously applied, were simply unacceptable.\n\n[20]\n\nTo address this impasse Wilson suggested that the military chiefs be consulted. Douglas Haig, representing the British forces, urged moderation, stating that \"Germany is not broken in the military sense\", that \"it is necessary to grant Germany conditions that they can accept\", and that surrender of occupied territories and Alsace-Lorraine would be \"sufficient to seal the victory\". The British also took the position that the German army should be kept mobilised as a counter to the spread of communist agitation. Ferdinand Foch, speaking for the French forces, agreed with Haig that the Germans \"could undoubtedly take up a new position, and we could not prevent it\", but, contrary to Haig, urged stringent terms including an occupation of the Rhineland with Allied bridgeheads over the Rhine, and the surrender of large quantities of military materiel. General Pershing, commander of the American forces, opposed any armistice being granted to the Germans. The combined effect of this feedback was to nullify Wilson's 14 points.[21]\n\n### German Revolution\n\n[edit]The sailors' revolt that took place during the night of 29 to 30 October 1918 in the port of Wilhelmshaven spread across Germany within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November and to the announcement of the abdication of Wilhelm II.[a] Workers' and soldiers' councils took control in most major cities west of the Elbe, including Berlin, where the new Reich government, the socialist-dominated Council of the People's Deputies, had their full support.[22] One of the primary goals of the councils was an immediate end to the war.[23]\n\nAlso on 9 November, Max von Baden handed the office of chancellor to Friedrich Ebert, a Social Democrat who the same day became co-chair of the Council of the People's Deputies.[24] Two days later, on behalf of the new government, Matthias Erzberger of the Catholic Centre Party signed the armistice at Compi\u00e8gne. The German High Command pushed the blame for the surrender away from the Army and onto others, including the socialists who were supporting and running the government in Berlin.[25] In the eyes of the German Right, the blame was carried over to the Weimar Republic when it was established in 1919. This resulted in a considerable amount of instability in the new republic.[26]\n\n## Negotiation process\n\n[edit]The Armistice was the result of a hurried and desperate process. The German delegation headed by Erzberger crossed the front line in five cars and was escorted for ten hours across the devastated war zone of Northern France, arriving on the morning of 8 November 1918. They were then taken to the secret destination aboard Foch's private train parked in a railway siding in the Forest of Compi\u00e8gne.[27]\n\nFoch appeared only twice in the three days of negotiations: on the first day, to ask the German delegation what they wanted, and on the last day, to see to the signatures. The Germans were handed the list of Allied demands and given 72 hours to agree. The German delegation discussed the Allied terms not with Foch, but with other French and Allied officers. The Armistice amounted to substantial German demilitarization (see list below), with few promises made by the Allies in return. The naval blockade of Germany was not completely lifted until complete peace terms could be agreed upon.[28][29]\n\nThere were very few negotiations. The Germans were able to correct a few impossible demands (for example, the decommissioning of more submarines than their fleet possessed), extend the schedule for the withdrawal and register their formal protest at the harshness of Allied terms. But they were in no position to refuse to sign. On Sunday, 10 November 1918, the Germans were shown newspapers from Paris to inform them that the Kaiser had abdicated. That same day, Ebert instructed Erzberger to sign. The cabinet had earlier received a message from Paul von Hindenburg, head of the German High Command, requesting that the armistice be signed even if the Allied conditions could not be improved on.[30][31]\n\nThe Armistice was agreed upon at 5:00 a.m. on 11 November 1918, to come into effect at 11:00 a.m. Paris Time (noon Berlin Time, 11:00 UT),[32][33] for which reason the occasion is sometimes referred to as \"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\". Signatures were made, depending on the source of information, between 5:00 a.m. and 5:45 a.m. Paris time.[ citation needed]\n\n### Allied Rhineland occupation\n\n[edit]The occupation of the Rhineland took place following the Armistice. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces.\n\n## Prolongation\n\n[edit]The Armistice was prolonged three times before peace was finally ratified. During this period it was also developed.\n\n- First Armistice (11 November 1918 \u2013 13 December 1918)\n- First prolongation of the armistice (13 December 1918 \u2013 16 January 1919)\n- Second prolongation of the armistice (16 January 1919 \u2013 16 February 1919)\n- Tr\u00e8ves Agreement, 17 January 1919\n[34]\n\n- Tr\u00e8ves Agreement, 17 January 1919\n- Third prolongation of the armistice (16 February 1919 \u2013 10 January 1920)\n[35]- Brussels Agreement, 14 March 1919\n[36]\n\n- Brussels Agreement, 14 March 1919\n\nPeace was ratified at 4:15 p.m. on 10 January 1920.[37]\n\n## Key personnel\n\n[edit]For the Allies, the personnel involved were all military. The two signatories were:[32]\n\n- Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch, the Allied supreme commander\n- First Sea Lord Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss, the British representative\n\nOther members of the delegation included:\n\n- General Maxime Weygand, Foch's chief of staff (later French commander-in-chief in 1940)\n- Rear-Admiral George Hope, Deputy First Sea Lord\n- Captain Jack Marriott, British naval officer, Naval Assistant to the First Sea Lord\n\nFor Germany, the four signatories were:[32]\n\n- Matthias Erzberger, a civilian politician\n- Count Alfred von Oberndorff, from the Foreign Ministry\n- Major General Detlof von Winterfeldt, army\n- Captain Ernst Vanselow, navy\n\nIn addition, the German delegation was accompanied by two translators:[38]\n\n- Captain Geyser\n- Cavalry Captain (Rittmeister) von Helldorff\n\n## Terms\n\n[edit]Among its 34 clauses, the armistice contained the following major points:[39]\n\nA. Western Front\n\n- Termination of hostilities on the Western Front, on land and in the air, within six hours of signature.\n[32] - Immediate evacuation of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Alsace\u2013Lorraine within 15 days.

One hour later, Foch, accompanied by a British admiral, presented himself at the Ministry of War, where he was immediately received by Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France. At 10:50 a.m., Foch issued this general order: \"Hostilities will cease on the whole front as from November 11 at 11 o'clock French time. The Allied troops will not, until further order, go beyond the line reached on that date and at that hour.\"[43] Five minutes later, Clemenceau, Foch and the British admiral went to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. At the first shot fired from the Eiffel Tower, the Ministry of War and the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace displayed flags, while bells around Paris rang. Five hundred students gathered in front of the Ministry and called upon Clemenceau, who appeared on the balcony. Clemenceau exclaimed \"Vive la France!\" \u2013 the crowd echoed him. At 11:00 a.m., the first peace-gunshot was fired from Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien, which told the population of Paris that the armistice was concluded, but the population were already aware of it from official circles and newspapers.[44]\n\nAlthough the information about the imminent ceasefire had spread among the forces at the front in the hours before, fighting in many sections of the front continued right until the appointed hour. At 11 a.m., there was some spontaneous fraternization between the two sides but in general, reactions were muted. A British corporal reported: \"...the Germans came from their trenches, bowed to us and then went away. That was it. There was nothing with which we could celebrate, except cookies.\"[45] On the Allied side, euphoria and exultation were rare. There was some cheering and applause, but the dominant feeling was silence and emptiness after 52 exhausting months of war.[45] According to Thomas R. Gowenlock, an intelligence officer with the U.S. First Division, shelling from both sides continued during the rest of the day, ending only at nightfall.[46][47]\n\nThe peace between the Allies and Germany was subsequently settled in 1919, by the Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles that same year.[ cita\n...\n[truncated]\n\n# Open Result 3\n# Treaty of Versailles\n\n\nTreaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany[n. 1] | |\n|---|---|\n| Signed | 28 June 1919[1] |\n| Location | Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles, Versailles, France[2] |\n| Effective | 10 January 1920[3] |\n| Condition | Ratification by Germany and three Principal Allied and Associate Powers[n. 2] |\n| Parties | Principal Allied and Associated Powers[n. 1]Allied and Associated Powers [n. 1] |\n| Depositary | French Government[n. 2] |\n| Languages | French and English[n. 2] |\n| Full text | |\n| Treaty of Versailles at Wikisource |\n\n| Paris Peace Conference |\n|---|\n\n| Events leading to World War II |\n|---|\n\nThe **Treaty of Versailles**[ii] was a peace treaty signed on 28 June 1919. As the most important treaty of World War I, it ended the state of war between Germany and most of the Allied Powers. It was signed in the Palace of Versailles, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which led to the war. The other Central Powers on the German side signed separate treaties.[iii] Although the armistice of 11 November 1918 ended the actual fighting, and agreed certain principles and conditions including the payment of reparations, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. Germany was not allowed to participate in the negotiations before signing the treaty.[4]\n\nThe treaty required Germany to disarm, make territorial concessions, extradite alleged war criminals, agree to Kaiser Wilhelm being put on trial, recognise the independence of states whose territory had previously been part of the German Empire, and pay reparations to the Entente powers. The most critical and controversial provision in the treaty was: \"The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.\"[5] The other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles. This article, Article 231, became known as the \"War Guilt\" clause.\n\nCritics including John Maynard Keynes declared the treaty too harsh, styling it as a \"Carthaginian peace\", and saying the reparations were excessive and counterproductive. On the other hand, prominent Allied figures such as French Marshal Ferdinand Foch criticized the treaty for treating Germany too leniently. This is still the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists.\n\nThe result of these competing and sometimes conflicting goals among the victors was a compromise that left no one satisfied. In particular, Germany was neither pacified nor conciliated, nor was it permanently weakened. The United States never ratified the Versailles treaty; instead it made a separate peace treaty with Germany, albeit based on the Versailles treaty. The problems that arose from the treaty would lead to the Locarno Treaties, which improved relations between Germany and the other European powers. The reparation system was reorganized and payments reduced in the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. Bitter resentment of the treaty powered the rise of the Nazi Party, and eventually the outbreak of a second World War.\n\nAlthough it is often referred to as the \"Versailles Conference\", only the actual signing of the treaty took place at the historic palace. Most of the negotiations were in Paris, with the \"Big Four\" meetings taking place generally at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quai d'Orsay.\n\n## Background\n\n### First World War\n\nWar broke out following the July Crisis in 1914. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, followed quickly by Germany declaring war on Russia on 1 August, and on Belgium and France on 3 August. The German invasion of Belgium on 3 August led to a declaration of war by Britain on Germany on 4 August, creating the conflict that became the First World War.[6] Two alliances faced off, the Central Powers (led by Germany) and the Triple Entente (led by Britain, France and Russia). Other countries entered as fighting raged widely across Europe, as well as the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Having seen the overthrow of the Tsarist regime in the February Revolution and the Kerensky government in the October Revolution, the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic under Vladimir Lenin in March 1918 signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, amounting to a surrender that was highly favourable to Germany. Sensing victory before the American Expeditionary Forces could be ready, Germany now shifted forces to the Western Front and tried to overwhelm the Allies. It failed. Instead, the Allies won decisively on the battlefield, overwhelmed Germany's Turkish, Austrian, and Bulgarian allies, and forced an armistice in November 1918 that resembled a surrender.[7]\n\n### Role of the Fourteen Points\n\nThe United States entered the war against the Central Powers in 1917 and President Woodrow Wilson played a significant role in shaping the peace terms. His expressed aim was to detach the war from nationalistic disputes and ambitions. On 8 January 1918, Wilson issued the Fourteen Points. They outlined a policy of free trade, open agreements, and democracy. While the term was not used, self-determination was assumed. It called for a negotiated end to the war, international disarmament, the withdrawal of the Central Powers from occupied territories, the creation of a Polish state, the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic lines, and the formation of a League of Nations to guarantee the political independence and territorial integrity of all states.[8][n. 3]\nIt called for what it characterised as a just and democratic peace uncompromised by territorial annexation. The Fourteen Points were based on the research of the Inquiry, a team of about 150 advisors led by foreign-policy advisor Edward M. House, into the topics likely to arise in the expected peace conference.[9]\n\n### Armistice\n\nDuring the autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse.[10] Desertion rates within the German army began to increase, and civilian strikes drastically reduced war production.[11][12] On the Western Front, the Allied forces launched the Hundred Days Offensive and decisively defeated the German western armies.[13] Sailors of the Imperial German Navy at Kiel mutinied in response to the naval order of 24 October 1918, which prompted uprisings in Germany, which became known as the German Revolution.[14][15] The German government tried to obtain a peace settlement based on the Fourteen Points, and maintained it was on this basis that they surrendered. Following negotiations, the Allied powers and Germany signed an armistice, which came into effect on 11 November while German forces were still positioned in France and Belgium.[16][17][18]\n\nMany aspects of the Versailles treaty that were later criticised were agreed first in the 11 November armistice agreement, whilst the war was still ongoing. These included the German evacuation of German-occupied France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Alsace-Lorraine, and the left bank of the Rhine (all of which were to be administered by the Allies under the armistice agreement), the surrender of a large quantity of war materiel, and the agreed payment of \"reparation for damage done\".[19]\n\nGerman forces evacuated occupied France, Belgium, and Luxembourg within the fifteen days required by the armistice agreement.[20] By late 1918, Allied troops had entered Germany and began the occupation of the Rhineland under the agreement, in the process establishing bridgeheads across the Rhine in case of renewed fighting at Cologne, Koblenz, and Mainz. Allied and German forces were additionally to be separated by a 10 km-wide demilitarised zone.[21][22]\n\n### Blockade\n\nBoth Germany and Great Britain were dependent on imports of food and raw materials, most of which had to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. The Blockade of Germany was a naval operation conducted by the Allied Powers to stop the supply of raw materials and foodstuffs reaching the Central Powers. The German *Kaiserliche Marine* was mainly restricted to the German Bight and used commerce raiders and unrestricted submarine warfare for a counter-blockade. The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 stated that 763,000 German civilians had died during the Allied blockade, although an academic study in 1928 put the death toll at 424,000 people.[23]\n\nThe blockade was maintained for eight months after the Armistice in November 1918, into the following year of 1919. Foodstuffs imports into Germany were controlled by the Allies after the Armistice with Germany until Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919.[24] In March 1919, Churchill informed the House of Commons, that the ongoing blockade was a success and \"Germany is very near starvation.\"[25] From January 1919 to March 1919, Germany refused to agree to Allied demands that Germany surrender its merchant ships to Allied ports to transport food supplies. Some Germans considered the armistice to be a temporary cessation of the war and knew, if fighting broke out again, their ships would be seized.[26] Over the winter of 1919, the situation became desperate and Germany finally agreed to surrender its fleet in March.[27] The Allies then allowed for the import of 270,000 tons of foodstuffs.[27]\n\nBoth German and non-German observers have argued that these were the most devastating months of the blockade for German civilians,[28] though disagreement persists as to the extent and who is truly at fault.[29][30][31][32][33] According to Max Rubner 100,000 German civilians died due to the continuation blockade after the armistice.[34] In the UK, Labour Party member and anti-war activist Robert Smillie issued a statement in June 1919 condemning continuation of the blockade, claiming 100,000 German civilians had died as a result.[35][36]\n\n## Negotiations\n\nTalks between the Allies to establish a common negotiating position started on 18 January 1919, in the *Salle de l'Horloge* (Clock Room) at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris.[37]\nInitially, 70 delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations.[38] Russia was excluded due to their signing of a separate peace (the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) and early withdrawal from the war. Furthermore, German negotiators were excluded to deny them an opportunity to divide the Allies diplomatically.[39]\n\nInitially, a \"Council of Ten\" (comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) met officially to decide the peace terms. This council was replaced by the \"Council of Five\", formed from each country's foreign ministers, to discuss minor matters. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and United States President Woodrow Wilson formed the \"Big Four\" (at one point becoming the \"Big Three\" following the temporary withdrawal of Orlando). These four men met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions, which were later ratified by the entire assembly. The minor powers attended a weekly \"Plenary Conference\" that discussed issues in a general forum but made no decisions. These members formed over 50 commissions that made various recommendations, many of which were incorporated into the final text of the treaty.[40][41][42]\n\n### French aims\n\nFrance had lost 1.3 million soldiers, including 25% of French men aged 18\u201330, as well as 400,000 civilians. France had also been more physically damaged than any other nation; the so-called zone rouge (Red Zone), the most industrialized region and the source of most coal and iron ore in the north-east, had been devastated, and in the final days of the war, mines had been flooded and railways, bridges and factories destroyed.[43]\nClemenceau intended to ensure the security of France, by weakening Germany economically, militarily, territorially and by supplanting Germany as the leading producer of steel in Europe.[43][44][45]\nBritish economist and Versailles negotiator John Maynard Keynes summarized this position as attempting to \"set the clock back and undo what, since 1870, the progress of Germany had accomplished.\"[46]\n\nClemenceau told Wilson: \"America is far away, protected by the ocean. Not even Napoleon himself could touch England. You are both sheltered; we are not\".[47]\nThe French wanted a frontier on the Rhine, to protect France from a German invasion and compensate for French demographic and economic inferiority.[48][49]\nAmerican and British representatives refused the French claim and after two months of negotiations, the French accepted a British pledge to provide an immediate alliance with France if Germany attacked again, and Wilson agreed to put a similar proposal to the Senate. Clemenceau had told the Chamber of Deputies, in December 1918, that his goal was to maintain an alliance with both countries. Clemenceau accepted the offer, in return for an occupation of the Rhineland for fifteen years and that Germany would also demilitarise the Rhineland.[50]\n\nFrench negotiators required reparations, to make Germany pay for the destruction induced throughout the war and to decrease German strength.[43] The French also wanted the iron ore and coal of the Saar Valley, by annexation to France.[51]\nThe French were willing to accept a smaller amount of World War I reparations than the Americans would concede and Clemenceau was willing to discuss German capacity to pay with the German delegation, before the final settlement was drafted. In April and May 1919, the French and Germans held separate talks, on mutually acceptable arrangements on issues like reparation, reconstruction and industrial collaboration. France, along with the British Dominions and Belgium, opposed League of Nations mandates and favored annexation of former German colonies.[52]\n\nThe French, who had suffered significantly in the areas occupied by Germany during the war, were in favour of trying German war criminals, including the Kaiser. In the face of American objections that there was no applicable existing law under which the Kaiser could be tried, Clemenceau took the view that the \"law of responsibility\" overruled all other laws and that putting the Kaiser on trial offered the opportunity to establish this as an international precedent.[53]\n\n### British aims\n\nBritain had suffered heavy financial costs but suffered little physical devastation during the war.[54] British public opinion wanted to make Germany pay for the War.[55]\nPublic opinion favoured a \"just peace\", which would force Germany to pay reparations and be unable to repeat the aggression of 1914, although those of a \"liberal and advanced opinion\" shared Wilson's ideal of a peace of reconciliation.[16]\n\nIn private Lloyd George opposed revenge and attempted to compromise between Clemenceau's demands and the Fourteen Points, because Europe would eventually have to reconcile with Germany.[56]\nLloyd George wanted terms of reparation that would not cripple the German economy, so that Germany would remain a viable economic power and trading partner.[57][56][54] By arguing that British war pensions and widows' allowances should be included in the German reparation sum, Lloyd George ensured that a large amount would go to the British Empire.[58]\n\nLloyd George also intended to maintain a European balance of power to thwart a French attempt to establish itself as the dominant European power. A revived Germany would be a counterweight to France and a deterrent to Bolshevik Russia. Lloyd George also wanted to neutralize the German navy to keep the Royal Navy as the greatest naval power in the world; dismantle the German colonial empire with several of its territorial possessions ceded to Britain and others being established as League of Nations mandates, a position opposed by the Dominions.[56]\n\nTogether with the French, the British favoured putting German war criminals on trial, and included the Kaiser in this. Already in 1916 Herbert Asquith had declared the intention \"to bring to justice the criminals, whoever they be and whatever their station\", and a resolution of the war cabinet in 1918 reaffirmed this intent.[59] Lloyd George declared that the British people would not accept a treaty that did not include terms on this, though he wished to limit the charges solely to violation of the 1839 treaty guaranteeing Belgian neutrality.[60] The British were also well aware that the Kaiser having sought refuge in the Netherlands meant that any trial was unlikely to take place and therefore any Article demanding it was likely to be a dead letter.[61]\n\n### American aims\n\nBefore the American entry into the war, Wilson had talked of a \"peace without victory\".[62] This position fluctuated following the US entry into the war. Wilson spoke of the German aggressors, with whom there could be no compromised peace.[63]\nOn 8 January 1918, however, Wilson delivered a speech (known as the Fourteen Points) that declared the American peace objectives: the rebuilding of the European economy, self-determination of European and Middle Eastern ethnic groups, the promotion of free trade, the creation of appropriate mandates for former colonies, and above all, the creation of a powerful League of Nations that would ensure the peace.[64] The aim of the latter was to provide a forum to revise the peace treaties as needed, and deal with problems that arose as a result of the peace and the rise of new states.[65][56]\n\nWilson brought along top intellectuals as advisors to the American peace delegation, and the overall American position echoed the Fourteen Points. Wilson firmly opposed harsh treatment on Germany.[64] While the British and French wanted to largely annex the German colonial empire, Wilson saw that as a violation of the fundamental principles of justice and human rights of the native populations, and favored them having the right of self-determination via the creation of mandates. The promoted idea called for the major powers to act as disinterested trustees over a region, aiding the native populations until they could govern themselves.[66]\nIn spite of this position and in order to ensure that Japan did not refuse to join the League of Nations, Wilson favored turning over the former German colony of Shandong, in Eastern China, to the Japanese Empire rather than return the area to the Republic of China's control.[67]\nFurther confounding the Americans, was US internal partisan politics. In November 1918, the Republican Party won the Senate election by a slim margin. Wilson, a Democrat, refused to include prominent Republicans in the American delegation making his efforts seem partisan, and contributed to a risk of political defeat at home.[64]\n\nOn the subject of war crimes, the Americans differed to the British and French in that Wilson's proposal was that any trial of the Kaiser should be solely a political and moral affair, and not one of criminal responsibility, meaning that the death penalty would be precluded.[68] This was based on the American view, particularly those of Robert Lansing,[59] that there was no applicable law under which the Kaiser could be tried.[53] Additionally, the Americans favoured trying other German war criminals before military tribunals rather than an international court, with prosecutions being limited to \"violation[s] of the laws and customs of war\", and opposed any trials based on violations against what was called \"laws of humanity\".[68]\n\n### Italian aims\n\nVittorio Emanuele Orlando and his foreign minister Sidney Sonnino, an Anglican of British origins, worked primarily to secure the partition of the Habsburg Empire and their attitude towards Germany was not as hostile. Generally speaking, Sonnino was in line with the British posit\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step 1 \u2014 British diplomat \/ invasion: German troops invaded neutral Belgium on 4 August 1914 (reports came from the British minister in Brussels), an act that helped bring Britain into the war.

He is widely considered one of the greatest songwriters of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nMonteno wrote songs for other performers as well, most notably Zdravko \u010coli\u0107, To\u0161e Proeski, and the rock band Indexi.[1]\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]Monteno's father Osvaldo was an Italian from Monfalcone.[2] During World War II, he was drafted and deployed to occupied Yugoslavia in 1945 where he met a Bosniak woman named Bahrija in Sarajevo and fell in love.[3] Osvaldo left his pregnant wife in Italy to marry Bahrija.[4] Osvaldo's Italian wife gave birth in 1946 to a daughter named Daniela, Monteno's half-sister. Kemal was born to Osvaldo and Bahrija two years later in Sarajevo. Although his father was Catholic and his mother was a Muslim, Monteno was given a Muslim first name.[5]\n\nOsvaldo only spoke Italian and sang canzones to Monteno when he was a child, while his mother sang him Bosnian sevdalinkas.[6] Both Osvaldo and Bahrija were employed at Sarajevo's Ko\u0161evo Stadium.[7]\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]Monteno recorded his first song \"Lidija\" in 1967 and enjoyed a prosperous career in Yugoslavia. He is perhaps best known for \"Sarajevo, ljubavi moja\", which gained a cult following and is considered an evergreen homage to his home town.[8]\n\nMany of his songs have also been performed by others. For instance, \"Bacila je sve niz rijeku\" was a hit not only for him, but for To\u0161e Proeski, Crvena Jabuka and Indexi (the latter being the big hit). Similarly, others had success performing \"Nekako s prolje\u0107a\" (that one being a duet with Crvena Jabuka in 1991) and \"Nije htjela\". In a February 2014 interview, Monteno said that \"Nije htjela\" (*She Did Not Want To*) was written about a famous Yugoslav musician's wife, who was in love with another singer.[9]\n\nOver the years, due to his style of music, he became known as the \"Bosnian Roy Orbison\", and even the \"Bosnian Neil Diamond.\"[10]\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]Monteno met his future wife Branka in 1967 in Sarajevo. They married on 26 June 1971[11] when he returned from his mandatory stint in the Yugoslav People's Army.[12] Together they had a daughter Adrijana and a son \u0110ani.[13] He spent the entirety of the 1990s war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in besieged Sarajevo.[14]\n\n## Illness and death\n\n[edit]Monteno was diagnosed with diabetes in the late 1990s and received three-hour dialysis twice a week at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. Diabetes weakened his heart and Monteno felt that the stress of the war in his country also contributed to his illness.[15][16]\n\nMonteno suffered a heart attack on 30 December 2011[17] and had bypass surgery in January 2012. A performance at the 2012 Split Festival that summer was cancelled due to health issues[18] and rumors of his death circled the internet on 10 October 2012, even being picked up as fact by media in the region.[19]\n\nOn 15 November 2014, after nearly three years of waiting, Monteno received a phone call that a kidney was available for transplant.[20] He received the transplant the following morning in Zagreb.[21][22] He was again hospitalized in December 2014 and doctors believed that his \"body did not accept the kidney that was transplanted in November.\"[23][24][25]\n\nMonteno died on January 21, 2015, at Zagreb Rebro Hospital of pneumonia and sepsis.[26] In the hospital, doctors fought for Monteno's life for hours to no avail.[27][28][29] He was buried in his hometown of Sarajevo at the Bare Cemetery on 28 January 2015, seven days after his death.[30]\n\n## Discography\n\n[edit]### Studio albums\n\n[edit]*Muziko, ljubavi moja*(1973)*\u017dene, \u017eene*(1975)*Moje pjesme, moji snovi*(1977)*Za svoju du\u0161u*(1980)*Dolly Bell*(1981)*Uvijek ti se vra\u0107am*(1984)*Moje najdra\u017ee pjesme*(1985)*Romanti\u010dna plo\u010da*(1986)*Kako da te zaboravim*(1987)*Dunje i kola\u010di*(2004)*Samo malo ljubavi*(2009)*\u0160ta je \u017eivot*(2013)\n\n### Singles and EPS\n\n[edit]*Sviraj, gitaro moja \/ Jo\u0161 ju\u010de bili smo sretni*(1969)*Tu\u017ena je muzika \/ Pru\u017eam ti ruke*(1971)*\u0160to sam ti skrivio, \u017eivote moj \/ Jedne no\u0107i u Decembru*(1971)*La\u017e*(1972)*Du\u0161o moja \/ Nana*(1973)*Pahuljice moja*(1974)*Moj prijatelj ari \/ Mali mir*(1974)*Adrijana \/ Novembar*(1974)*Pjesma zaljubljenika \/ Znam sve o tebi*(1975)*Hiljade bijelih marama \/ Kad nas jednom godine odnesu*(1976)*Tajna \u017eena \/ Kad smo po\u0161li mi u \u0161umu*(1976)- Sarajevo, ljubavi moja \/ Kratak je svaki tren (1976)\n*Ljubavna bol*(1977)*Cvite bili iz \u0110ardina \/ Nemoj re\u0107i dovi\u0111enja*(1977)*Volim te \u017eivote kakav jesi \/ Na kraju grada*(1978)*Sunce djetinjstva \/ Putovanja, putovanja*(1978)*Nije htjela \/ Nek' sviraju gitare*(1978)*Ej, sre\u0107o moja \/ \u010cekat \u0107u te*(1978)*Adriana, Adriana \/ Bracera*(1979)*Postoji li mjesto \/ Ti si moja poezija*(1979)*Energoinvest*(1982)\n\n### Compilation albums\n\n[edit]*Volim te \u017eivote kakav jesi*(1978)*The Platinum Collection*(2007)*The Best Of... \/\/ Live*(2012)*50 originalnih pjesama*(2014)\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Kemal Monteno:\u010covjek koji je pisao pjesme za sva vremena\".*nezavisne.com*(in Bosnian). 27 January 2016.

Cooper,  Jr.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  a  few  fragments  containing  identifiably  Slovene  linguistic\nfeatures  most  notably  the  texts  discovered  at  Freising,  which  scholars  date  con\nventionally to the year 1000 AD  no writing, let alone literary creativity, took place in\nany of the numerous dialects of Slovene before the middle of the sixteenth century.  In\nthis  respect  Slovene  as  a  medium  of  intellectual  and  social  communication  stood\nsignificantly  behind  the  other  Slavic  cultures  of  Southeastern  Europe  Bulgarian,\nSerbian and Croatian  which by  1550 had not only produced works of art of enduring\nimportance,  but  had  contributed  as  well  individuals  of  talent  to  the  international\ncultures  of their  times:  in  the  Orthodox  east  men  like  Gregorij  Camblak  and  Kon\nstantin  Kostenki;  in  the  Latin  west  Marko  Marulic  and  Matthias  Flacius  Illyricus.\nSlovene  backwardness  was  the  result  of  a  variety  of  circumstances  historic,  geo\nthat successfully impeded the formation of a Slov\ngraphic, economic, and linguistic\nene  ethnic  awareness  for  the  first  thousand  years  of Slavic  settlement  in  the  Eastern\nAlps  (ca.  550-1550). As Rado Lencek notes  (1982:42), \"it is obvious that the modern\nconcept of the  'Slovene language,' or anything 'Slovene'  for  that matter, did  not  exist\nduring  these  centuries.\"  Indeed,  the  retention  of the  very  name Slovene,  which  was\nsimply  the  generic  term  for  all  Slavs,  may  reflect  the' unselfconscious  attitude of the\nEastern Alpine  Slavs.  Not until  the  nineteenth  century was  it  possible  to  distinguish\nbetween  \"Slovene\"  and  \"Slav\"  in  the  Slovene  language,  and  then  only  thanks  to  a\nborrowing from  the Czech  (Lencek  1982:23).\n\nThe year  1550  represents  a  fateful  turning  point  for  the Slovenes,  one  with  whose\nrepercussions  we  live,  it  is  no  exaggeration  to  say,  to  the  present  day.  As  a  result  of\nactivities  occurring  in  the  first  half  of  the  sixteenth  century,  a  consciously  supra\ndialectal form of Slovene was encoded in  book form and published. This epochal event\nproved  not  to  be  an  isolated  instance,  but  the  beginning  of a  series of publications  in\nSlovene (somewhere between forty  and fifty  books were eventually printed, composed\nby approximately twenty Slovene Lutheran clergy and laymen [Slodnjak 1958: 64-5]).\nTheir activities  continued  intermittently for  almost  fifty  years,  until  the expulsion  of\nthe  Lutherans  from  the  Inner-Austrian  lands  in  1598.  Concurrently  with  this  last\nphase  of Slovene  Protestant  literary  creativity,  a  period  of  Counter-Reformational\nwriting also took place:  it ended in  1615  with the publication by  a  Jesuit priest of the\nSlovene translation of St. Peter Cani~ius' Catechism us . That  book  marked,  however,\na very  clear terminus ad quem  for  this  first  period of writing  in  Slovene.  No further\nprinting in  the language would take place until  1672, and then only a reprinting of one\nof the Counter-Reformational texts.  No true literary creativity would be permitted to\noccur in  Slovene until  the times  of Maria Theresa and Joseph  II, i.e.,  the second  half\nof the eighteenth century.\n\nIn  the  Slovene  lands,  then,  the  period  1550-1615  stands  in  stark  and  brilliant\ncontrast  to  the  darkness  before  and  the  darkness  after.  Though  relative  to  their\nneighbors  the Slovenes  came late  to  literacy  in  the  native  tongue,  nevertheless  in  six\nand a half short decades they not  only found  their voice but created a body of writing\nthat would lead to the formation of a rich and vital modern culture. It is about this first\nseminal period of Slovene  letters  I  would  like  to  speak in some detail  today.l\n\n35\n\n\n\n---\n\n36\n\nHENRY  R.  COOPER, JR.\n\nThree factors  conditioned  the development of Slovene culture in  the sixteenth cen\ntury:  the Protestant Reformation, which combined  the humanism of the Renaissance\nwith  a  renewed  and  militant  Christian  piety;  the  Roman  Catholic  Counter\nReformation, which was to be closely associated with  the Baroque in  Central Europe;\nand the Turkish threat,  which  hit its  peak in  the sixteenth century. These factors  are\nclearly  not  of  equal  importance:  the  Reformation,  especially  in  the  form  of  Lu\ntheranism  as  it  was  practiced  in  the  German  lands,  provided  the  matrix  for  Slovene\ndevelopments, while the Counter-Reformation and the intrusions of the Turks merely\nimpeded, or at most  undermined,  but did  not  determine those  developments.  Each of\nthese  three  factors,  did,  however,  help  to  shape  the  nascent Slovene  consciousness  of\nthe Slavic inhabitants of Inner Austria.\n\nThe Protestant  Reformation  is  dated  conventionally  from  the  last  day  of October\n1517,  when  the  young  Augustinian  monk,  Martin  Luther  (1483-1546),  nailed  his\nninety-five  theses  to  the  chapel  door  of the  Castle of Wittenberg  to  protest,  among\nother things the sale of indulgences. Thanks to Luther's zeal and eloquence, but also as\na result of the Central European political situation and the power of the printing press,\nhis  ideas  spread  rapidly.  Though  we  do  not  know  when  they  first  appeared  in  the\nSlovene lands (Grafenauer [1979:266]  cites 1518 for  Carinthia), we do assume that by\nthe  mid  1520's  they  were  well  in  evidence  there.  In  1527,  160  copies  of  Kaiser\nFerdinand 1's decree against the Protestants reached Ljubljana: it threatened any who\ndenied  the  sacraments  of  the  Catholic  Church  with  capital  punishment  (Rupel\n1965:34).  Evidently  it  had  little  impact,  for  two  years  later  Mathes  Klombner,  who\nheld a responsible position in the Carniolan Diet (deZelni stanovi,  Landestcmde), was\nmade  the  head  of  the  Lutheran  community  in  Ljubljana  (ibid:35) .  Lutherans  and\nCatholics  would  thereafter  coexist  in  Carniola,  Styria,  Carinthia  and  other  Slovene\nlands, as well as in Trieste and the Croatian lands, till the end of the century. It should\n.  be  noted  that  in  Slovenia  Lutheranism was  almost  exclusively  a  bourgeois  phenom\nenon,  and therefore  restricted by and  large to the few  cities and larger  market towns\n(Ljubljana, Celje,  Maribor, Ptuj, Novo mesto, Skofja  Loka, Kranj,  Bled,  Klagenfurt,\nGraz, Villach, Gorica and a  few  others) .\n\n\u2022\n\nThe  end  of  the  Reformation  in  Slovenia  can  be  dated  with  exactitude.  In  1596\nArchduke  Ferdinand  inherited  control  of the  Inner  Austrian  lands  of the  Hapsburg\ndominion and began immediately to expel from  them all vestiges,  public and  private,\nof the  reformed  faith .  On  October  29,  1598,  his  decree  was  published  in  Ljubljana\ngiving  all  Protestant preachers and teachers  twenty-four hours  to  leave  the  city,  and\nthree days to leave the province; failure to comply carried pain of death. Commissions\nwere  established  to  check  the  bona  fides  of  all  remaining  citizens,  so  that  by  the\nbeginning of the seventeenth century, only the Protestant nobility of Austria, operating\nunder the Peace of Augsburg and the traditional deference shown to those of high rank\nby  others  of high  rank,  could  practice  Lutheranism  with  impunity.  Even  they  were\ncompelled  to  conform,  however,  after  the  outbreak  of  the  Thirty  Years'  War\n(1618-1648), which so sharpened religious tensions in the Hapsburg realm that in  1628\nnon-Catholic noblemen were also driven into exile from the Slovene lands. By this time,\nhowever, Protestantism had long since ceased to  be a vital force there. 2  We might also\nnote that during this hundred-or-so year period, the Reformation in the Inner Austrian\nlands was represented by and large by orthodox Lutheranism, though other Protestant\nmovements,  such  as  Calvinism,  Zwinglianism,  Flacianism,  and  Anabaptists  and  the\nlike,  were  not  unknown  (cf.  Grafenauer  1979:293) .\n\nThe Counter-Reformation, the second  factor of capital importance to Slovene cul-\n\n\n\n---\n\nTRUBAR AND SLOVENE LITERATURE\n\n37\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nture in  the sixteenth  century,  affected  the Slovene  lands  on  two  levels.  The first  was\ndoctrinaL As a result of the Council of Trent, called so  reluctantly by Pope Paul  III in\n1545  (its sessions  continued till  1552,  then  were  interrupted  until  the  papacy of Pius\nIV, who reconvened the delegates in January 1562 and concluded their deliberations in\nDecember  1563), Roman Catholicism rearticulated its articles of faith,  particularly in\nlight of the Protestant claims against them, and reinvigorated the spirits of those clergy\nand laity who had for one reason or another resisted the blandishments of the reformers\nfor almost half a century. Trent confirmed both doctrinally and practically the suprem\nacy of the Pope in all matters pertaining to the governance of the Roman Church. Thus\nit consecrated the centralizing view of authority also to be found in the lay governments\nof Europe at the time. It sanctioned the intrusion of the Church into the literary sphere\nwith  the  establishment,  in  March  1564,  of the  rules  governing  the  infamous  Index\nlibrorum prohibitorum. And in the compilation of a catechism and the elaboration of\n\"immutable\" rites such as  the Tridentine Mass, it strove to  make uniform the  beliefs\nand practices of the Western Church to a degree Christianity had never before experi\nenced. Thus Rome did not \"reform\" itself, at least in  the sense the earliest Protestants\nhad  demanded.  Rather  it  simply  supressed  some  of the  practices  the  reformers  had\nfound  most  noxious  (without,  however,  admitting  guilt  concerning  them),  and.  it\nstressed its strengths: through Apostolic Succession continuity with the ancient church,\nclarity and authority of its voice in its teaching, stability in its rigid hierarchy. With all\nthis  in  hand,  it  proceeded  to  the  regaining  of its  lost  sheep,  among  them  those  in  the\nSlovene lands.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe other level on which the Counter-Reformation affected the Slovenes was far less\nlofty  and  far  more  immediate.  In  1534  Ignatius  Loyola  established  the  Society  of\nJesus, which rapidly turned itself into the executive force of the Counter- Reformation.\nIn  1573  the  Jesuits  opened  their  first  school  in  Slovene  territory,  the  Collegium  at\nGraz, and quickly elevated it to university status (in  1580) for  the training of Catholic\nclergy. Among their students was Tomaz Hren (1560-1630), who  in  1599 became the\nBishop of Ljubljana.  He presided over  the dismantling of the  Reformation  in  his  see,\nthe  destruction  of many  Protestant  books  and  schools  (2,000  books  were  burned  in\nLjubljana [Grafenauer 1979:305]), and the re-establishment of Apostolic authority in\nthe area.  The Jesuits borrowed the tactics of their opponents where opportune.  Hren,\nfor  example,  is  credited  with  the  compilation  of  a  Sunday  lectionary  in  Slovene\n(Evange\/ija  inu  listuvi,  1613,  which  actually  used  the  Protestant  translations  of the\n\u2022\nNew Testament). As  noted earlier, Janez Candek, a  Jesuit of Visnja gora,  translated\nCanisius'  catechism  into  Slovene  in  1615.  The Jesuits  compiled  hymnals  in  the  ver\nnacular,  founded  schools,  and even  produced  plays.  For the  most  part,  however,  they\nshunned the Protestants' involvement with book production, so  that under the Jesuits'\naegis  Slovene  literature  disappeared  for  all  practical  intents  and  purposes  for  150\nyears.  They did,  however,  make contributions in  the pictorial and plastic arts,  as  well\nas  music,  and their impact can still  be  appreciated  in  the surviving artifacts,  particu\nlarly the architecture, of the Slovene  Baroque.  But  these  lie  outside  the scope  of this\npaper.\n\nWhile the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation represent\nin a sense opposite sides of the same coin, the third factor of cardinal importance to the\nSlovene lands in the sixteenth century is specie of a different kind. As Mirko Rupel, the\nmodern  biographer  of  Primoz  Trubar,  notes  concerning  that  reformer's  childhood\n(Rupel  1965:9):\n\n\n\n---\n\n38\n\nHENRY R.  COOPER, JR.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe  impression  that  the  tales  of the  Turkish  atrocities  made  on  the  imag\nination of the young boy  remained with  him till  the end of his  life.  In almost\neveryone  of  his  books  he  mentions  the  Turkish  danger  as  the  greatest\nmisfortune of the Slovene  peasant.\n\nHis parents had experienced Turkish rapacity firsthand,  in  the raids of 1471,  1476,\n1491  and  1497.  But even  more momentous for  the Hapsburg lands as a whole was  the\nspectacular rise of Turkish power in  the sixteenth century, particularly in  the reign of\nSultan Suleyman  I,  \"The Magnificent.\"  No  sooner  did  he  come  to  power  (in  IS20)\nthan Belgrade fell  (IS21), northern Bosnia fell  (1S22),  Buda fell  (1S26),  and the first\nseige of Vienna  was  laid  (1S29) . Throughout the entire middle of the century, during\nthe  heyday  of Slovene  Protestantism,  Slovene  eyes  were  constrained  to  gaze  quite\nto  the  southeast.  The  effects  on  the  reformers,\nuncharacteristically,  I  might  note\nparticularly Trubar, were significant, as I hope to show at the conclusion of this paper,\nand  even  when  Suleyman  died  in  IS66  and  the  Ottoman  Empire  slipped  into  rapid\ndecline (Sugar 1977: 19S), the Turkish threat remained an ever present reality, with all\nthe  implications  that  that would  have  for  Central  European  culture.  We  should  not\nforget  that the last Turkish seige of Vienna did not occur until  1683, nor that relative\nsecurity returned to the Slovene and Croatian lands only after the signing of the Treaty\nof Sremski Karlovci  in  1699.\n\nNow  that  I  have  set  the  stage,  so  to  speak,  by  providing  some  of the  cultural  and\nhistorical  background  of Slovene  Protestantism  (for  the  geographical  and  ecomonic\nbackground I refer to  the articles  by  Joseph  Velikonja,  \"Slovene and  Croatian Lands\nin  the  Sixteenth  Century  [A  Geographic  Framework]\",  Slovene  Studies,  6\/1-2\n[1984]:11-30; and Toussaint Hocevar \"A Comparison of Economic and Social Condi\ntions in Slovene and Croatians Lands during the Reformation\", ibid.,  31-48), I would\nlike now  to turn my attention to the principal actors on  this stage. There are five.  One\nI have already introduced, Bp. Hren of Ljubljana, in  his  role as  Catholic spoiler, as  it\nwere, of Protestant initiatives. I have little more to add concerning him, except to note\nthat as  the son  of Protestant parents he  knew  the reformers' works firsthand, and that\nmany scholars credit  him  with salvaging some of the Slovene  Protestant writings,  at\nleast those not in direct contradiction to Roman teaching. As we noted above, however,\nHren did  little or  nothing  to  extend  Slovene  literature,  and  as  such  is  of importance\nonly as the marker of the end of an  epoch  in  Slovene culture.\n\nThe  other  four  principals,  Protestants  all,  are  Primoz  Trubar  (IS08-1S86),\nSebastijan  Krelj  (1S38-1S67),  Adam  Bohoric  (ca.  IS20-after  IS98),  and  Jurij  Dal\nmatin  (1S47-1S89).  The  most  important  of these  is  Trubar,  whose  life  and  work  I\npropose to examine here in some detail. Of the. other three Dalmatin is  the outstanding\npersonality, so  that it is  his contributions to  the  formation of Slovene  literature I will\nconclude my  paper with.  Of Krelj  and  Bohoric  I will  be  able to  say only  a  little.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nFor  Ivan  Prijateij,  writing  in  1908,  Primoz  Trubar  was  the  \"cornerstone  of our\nculture\" (vogelni kamen nase kulture)  (Prijatelj  1908:S).  Basing himself in large part\non  the exhaustive publication of Trubariana by  Pastor Theodor Elze at the end of the\nnineteenth century (particularly  his  edition of Trubar's letters in  1897  [Primus  Tru\nbers  Briefe  (Tiibingen:  Bibliothek  des  literarischen  Vereins  in  Stuttgart,  1897)]),\nPrijateij's reassessment of the Protestant reformer contributed enormously to Trubar's\nliterary and historical  reputation  in  the Slovene  lands.  Only  two short  years  later, in\nfact, a statue was  raised  to  the  \"Father of Slovene Literature\" at the entrance of the\nTivoli Park in  Ljubljana .\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n---\n\nTRUBAR AND SLOVENE LITERATURE\n\n39\n\nFor  Mirko  Rupel,  Trubar's  definitive  biographer  (for  an  evaluation  of  the  three\nTrubar biographies already written, see Fr. Rudolph Flanik's review article in Slovene\nStudies  4\/1  [1981],  49-56),  Trubar stands with  France Preseren,  Fran  Levstik,  and\nIvan Cankar as one of the \"highpoints\" of Slovene literary and cultural history (Rupel\n1965:275).  More than anyone else, according to  Rupel,  he embodied the entire begin\nning  of cultural  awareness  among  the  Slovenes.  His  life  and  work  were  intimately\nconnected with  every Slovene  writer of the sixteenth  century,  Catholic or Protestant,\nand his impact on the written Slovene word would continue to be felt hundreds of years\nafter his  death.\n\n,\n\nEven in  modern Yugoslavia Trubar has continued to serve as a lively topic of debate\nfor  his  countrymen.  Matthias  Murko  marvelled  at Trubar's amazing awareness of a\nSouth  Slavic  continuum  in  his  study  Die  Bedeutung  der  Reformation  und  Gegen\nreformation  fur  das  geistige  Leben  der  Sudslaven  (Prague  and  Heidelberg: 1927).\nFrance Kidric devoted  a 'number of exhaustively researched articles to  Trubar's liter\nary activities  (cf.  Kidric,  1978:11-161).  F.  Orazem and  loze Rajhman have  recently\n(1964  and  1974  respectively)  defended  dissertations  on  Trubar's  theology  (Flanik\n1981 :56,  note  7), and Rajhman has gone on  to  write a  lengthy study of Trubar's first\npublication  (Prva  slovenska  knjiga  [Ljubljana:  Partizanska  knijiga,  1977]).  Two\nwriters,  loze  lavorilek  and  lozko  Humar,  in  1977  and  1980  respectively,  have\nattempted  to  reinterpret  Trubar as  an  early  exemplar of liberation  theology  (Flanik\n1981 :54-5),  a  predecessor  of  the  Communist  politicians  Boris  Kidric  and  Edvard\nKardelj. And the recently deceased Anton Slodnjak devoted a substantial portion of his\nGerman-language  history  of  Slovene  literature  to  Trubar's  activities  (Slodnjak\n1958:49-66). Be  it also noted  that Trubar's fame has spread overseas as  well:  in  1984\nhe was one of the chief objects of investigation of the Conference convened  to observe\nthe  four-hundredth  anniversary  of  the  translation  of  the  Bible  into  Slovene.  The\nproceedings of this meeting, which took place at the University of Chicago last March,\nare available in volume 6 of the journal Slovene Studies, cited above.\n\n\u2022\n\nTrubar was  the author  not  only  of the  first  book of the Slovene  Reformation  (and\nindeed of all Slovene literature),  but for  all  practical intents and  purposes  of the  last\nbook as  well.  In  1550 or perhaps  1551  hi~ \"Catechismus in  der  Windischenn Sprach,\nsambt einer kiirtzen Ausslegung in gesang weiss.  Item die Litanai vnd ein Predig vom\nrechten  Glauben,  gestelt,  durch  Philopatridum  Illiricum,\"  with  the  Slovene  subtitle\n\"Anu kratku Poduuzhene skaterim vsaki  zhlouik more vnebu pryti,\" was published in\nTiibingen, along with another small volume  that has  a  short German title and a  long\nSlovene subtitle: \"Abecedarium vnd der klein Catechismus In der Windischen Sprach:\nAne  Buquice,  is  tih  se  ty  Mladi  inu  preprosti  Slouenci  mogo  lahku  vkratkim  zhasu\nbrati nauuzhiti, v tih so  tudi ty vegshy stuki te  kerszhanske  Vere  inu ane  Molytue,  te\nso  prepisane ad aniga Peryatila vseh Slouenzou.\" These bibliophilic rarities,  p\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step-by-step reasoning (with sources):\n\n1.

Her work was admired not only in Russia, but also far beyond the borders of her native country. She is known to many as the daughter of V. Pozner.\n\n## Childhood and youth\n\nEkaterina's date of birth is May 6, 1960. She was lucky to be born in the capital of Russia - Moscow. She was raised by Vladimir Pozner and his first wife Valentina Chemberdzhi, who was working as a translator at the time of her daughter's birth.\n\nKatya's parents had their first marriage. Both of them were not ready for family life. Posner knew absolutely nothing about raising children. One day, the father hit the girl on the cheek, simply because she refused to eat. The blow was so strong that Katya started bleeding from the nose. By the way, this was the last domestic violence in the family. Vladimir promised himself that this would not happen again.\n\nThe young family lived under the same roof with Valentina's mother, Zara Levina. Catherine's grandmother was a famous composer, and it was under her influence that the girl began to study music. The head of the family did not find a common language with the wife's mother.\n\nCatherine's father and mother divorced after Vladimir cheated on Valentina. At that time, the girl was only six years old. She emotionally survived the divorce of her parents. Katya began to spend a lot of time playing the piano. A year later, she entered a music school and immediately established herself as a capable student.\n\nFor a special education, the girl went to the Moscow Conservatory. She received a diploma as a pianist and composer, and then entered graduate school.\n\nEkaterina communicated with her father and mother. After the divorce, the parents managed to maintain friendly relations with each other. Valentina got married a second time, and even gave birth to Katya's brother.\n\n## Ekaterina Chemberdzhi: Creative way\n\nIn the mid-80s, she became part of the Union of Composers of the Soviet Union. At the beginning of her career, Ekaterina taught at the Gnessin School, and also actively composed musical works. She often wrote musical accompaniment to films. Ekaterina was lucky to work on The Warrior Girl and Chernov.\n\nShortly before the collapse of the USSR, Chemberdzhi decided to change her place of residence. She moved to Germany. The composer attended fashion festivals, and also helped young and talented musicians to discover their talent. She became the author of the \"keyboard\" technique. The essence of the technique was the rapid development of tonal structures.\n\nIn parallel with her teaching activities, Ekaterina replenished her repertoire with new works. She played music and performed with other creative groups. Since the mid-90s, the composer has been making a series of radio recordings of piano works for the German DeutschlandRadio.\n\nA year later, the presentation of Ekaterina's author's cantata took place. We are talking about the musical work of Cantus controversus. The composition was warmly received by admirers of classical music. On the wave of recognition, she composes the chamber operetta Max und Moritz, which the fans greeted no less warmly and cordially than the cantata.\n\nIn 2008, she began working with her famous father. Ekaterina composed music for his TV shows. The composer wrote the musical accompaniment to the film \"The Most, Most, Most.\" Note that the film would have been screened in 2018.\n\n## Details of privacy\n\nWe can safely say that the personal life of the maestro woman has developed successfully. She married a German by nationality. Actually, because of love, Catherine moved to Germany. In this marriage, two children were born - a son and a daughter.\n\n## Interesting facts about the composer Ekaterina Chemberdzhi\n\n- She loves the works of Gogol, Chekhov and Pushkin.

Pozner later described his role as propaganda.[2][4]\n\nAfter the Cold War, Pozner moved to the United States to work with Phil Donahue, before returning to Moscow to continue working as a television journalist. From 2008 until 2022, he hosted the eponymous show *Pozner* on Russia's Channel One where he interviewed public figures.\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]Vladimir Pozner was born in Paris on 1 April 1934, to a Russian Jewish father, Vladimir Aleksandrovich Pozner, and a French Catholic mother, G\u00e9raldine Lutten.[2] The couple separated shortly after his birth. When Vladimir was 3 months old, he and his mother moved to New York City, where G\u00e9raldine's mother and younger sister lived. In the spring of 1939 Pozner's parents reunited and the family returned to Paris, France.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II and the invasion of France the Pozners fled Paris in the fall of 1940, traveling via Marseille in the Free Zone, Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon, before sailing back to the US. The escape was partially financed by a Jewish family whose adult daughter traveled with the Pozners disguised as Vladimir's nanny.\n\nBack in New York, Vladimir attended Caroline Pratt's City and Country School[5] and later Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan.[6] Robert Hollander, an elementary school friend of Pozner, remembered him most vividly for \"his capacities for, one, having extraordinarily attractive fantasies and, two, for getting the rest of us to believe them.\"[7]\n\nIn 1946, with the advent of what later came to be called McCarthyism, Pozner senior began to have serious problems with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, because of his pro-Soviet views and alleged cooperation with the Soviet intelligence services. The documents that conclusively proved the secret service connections of his father were published in 1996 in the United States, as part of the Venona project files*.*[8][9]\n\nAs a result, the Pozners intended to return to France, but Pozner senior was refused a French visa after being denounced to the French Foreign Ministry as a \"subversive element\" and a spy. The family moved in 1948 to the Soviet sector of Berlin, where Pozner senior was offered a position with SovExportFilm, an international distributor of Soviet films. At one time Pozner junior claimed to have stayed behind in New York, attending Columbia College between 1950 and December 1953; however, there appears to be no record of him at Columbia.[7] Currently he tells of attending a Russian military-style high school in Berlin run by the Soviet Military Administration during that time.\n\nIn 1952, the Pozner family moved to Moscow.[10] In 1953 the younger Pozner enrolled at Moscow State University, Faculty of Biology and Soil Science, majoring in human physiology. He graduated in 1958.\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]Pozner began his career as a \"journalist\" \u2013 unwittingly, by his own account \u2013 in a disinformation department of the KGB.[11] In 1961 he was offered the position of senior editor with the English-language *Soviet Life* magazine. In 1967 he transferred to a sister publication, *Sputnik*, leaving it in February 1970 to take up a post with the State Television and Radio Committee, where he became a chief commentator and host of the propaganda radio program the *Voice of Moscow* on the North American service of Radio Moscow.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, and until the early 1990s, Pozner was a regular guest on Ray Briem's talk show on KABC in Los Angeles. During the 1980s, he was a favourite guest on Ted Koppel's *Nightline*.[12] Pozner was the host of *Moscow Meridian*, an English-language current affairs program focusing on the Soviet Union; the show was produced by Gosteleradio, the Soviet State Committee for Television and Radio and broadcast on the Satellite Program Network.[13] He also often appeared on *The Phil Donahue Show*.\n\nIn his Western media appearances Pozner was a charismatic and articulate apologist for some of the Soviet Union's most controversial foreign and domestic policy decisions. He would frequently draw parallels and point out similarities between Soviet and Western policies as well as candidly admitting the existence of certain problems in the USSR. However, while stopping short of unequivocal endorsement and support, he nevertheless rationalized, among other events, the arrest and exiling of Andrei Sakharov, the invasion of Afghanistan, and the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, in his 1990 autobiography *Parting with Illusions*.[14] Later, he wrote that some of the positions he had taken were wrong and immoral.[ citation needed] In a 2005 interview with NPR's\n\n*On the Media*, Pozner spoke openly about his role as a Soviet spokesman, stating bluntly, \"What I was doing was propaganda.\" Comparing his former role to that of Karen Hughes, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs under George W. Bush, he commented that, \"You know, as someone who's gone through this and someone who regrets having done what he's done, and who spent many, many years of his life, and I think probably the best years of my life, doing something that was wrong, I say it just isn't worth it\".\n\n[15]\n\nDespite his frequent appearances in the North American media and his near-celebrity status there as the principal spokesman for the Soviet Union, Pozner remained virtually unknown at home. This changed in the mid-1980s, when Pozner co-hosted several bilateral, televised discussions (or \"spacebridges\") between audiences in the Soviet Union and the US, carried via satellite.[16] These were initially produced with Helene Keyssar at the University of California, San Diego. They included \"Moscow Calling San Diego: Children and Film\" (with Mike Cole), \"Remembering War\" (May 7, 1985, with Fred Starr). Later programs included \"Citizens Summit I - Leningrad\/Seattle\" (December 29, 1985) and \"Citizens Summit II: Women to Women - Leningrad\/Boston\" (May 20, 1986) - both with Phil Donahue.[17] The programs marked a dramatic turning point in Pozner's career, garnering him instant renown and wide popularity and acclaim from domestic audiences in the USSR. Pozner also introduced Russian rock band Autograph for Live Aid.[18] He was promoted to the position of \"political observer of Central Television\", the highest journalistic rank at Gosteleradio, and started to work on programs that were broadcast domestically. However, in 1991 Pozner was asked to resign after being quoted voicing his support for Boris Yeltsin over Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nLater that year, Pozner received an offer to work with Phil Donahue and moved to the United States. From 1991 to 1994 they co-hosted *Pozner\/Donahue*, a weekly, issues-oriented roundtable program, which was aired both on CNBC and in syndication.[19] While living in New York, Pozner regularly commuted to Moscow to tape his programs that aired in Russia.\n\nPozner returned to Moscow in 1997, continuing his work as an independent television journalist. Later that year, he founded the School for Television Excellence (\u00ab\u0428\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u00bb) in Moscow to educate and promote young journalists.\n\nFrom its foundation in 1994 until 2008[20] Pozner was president of the Russian Television Academy, which annually awards the prestigious TEFI trophy. Pozner also worked for the Institute for US and Canadian Studies, a Soviet think tank.\n\nSince 2004, Pozner and his brother Pavel have owned a French brasserie in Moscow, \u0416\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0438\u043d (Chez G\u00e9raldine), named after their mother.[21]\n\n## Shows\n\n[edit]For many years during the Cold War, Pozner delivered the nightly \"Radio Moscow News and Commentary\" program on the North America Service with his signature greeting, \"Thank you and good evening\". Pozner was the host of several shows on Russian TV, among them the US-Soviet space bridges, *Mi* (translated *Us*), *Vremya i Mi* (*The Time and Us*), *Voskresnyi Vecher s Vladimirom Poznerom* (*Sunday Night with Vladimir Pozner*), *Chelovek v maske* (*A Man in the Mask*), *Vremena* (*Times*). Most of these followed a talk show format, with varying numbers of guests and varying degree and manner of audience participation.\n\nSince 2004 Pozner has been contributing his time as the host of *Vremya Zhit' !* (*A time to live!*), a series of talk shows about the problem of HIV\/AIDS. The programs are produced and broadcast by regional television stations and focus on addressing the local challenges that exist in different parts of Russia.\n\nIn the documentary film *Lugovoy, pervy podozrevaemy* (*Lugovoy, the first suspected*) about Andrey Lugovoy, suspected of being the killer of Aleksandr Litvinenko, Pozner makes important statements, such as his claim that KGB agents were taken for heroes in the Soviet Union, like James Bond in the UK.\n\nIn 2008 Pozner, together with Ivan Urgant and Brian Kahn, released *Odnoetazhnaya Amerika* (*\"One-Storied America\"*), a 16-episode travel documentary based on the 1937 book *Little Golden America* by Ilya Ilf and Yevgenyi Petrov.[22] Pozner and Urgant also collaborated on a number of subsequent projects: *Tour de France*, *Their Italy*, *German Conundrum*, *England Generally and Particularly*, and *Jewish Happiness*, broadcast in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 respectively.\n\nIn 2008 Pozner launched the eponymous show *Pozner* on Russia's Channel One,[23] in which he interviews public figures \u2013 politicians, artists, scientists, musicians, actors, directors, sportsmen, doctors, magnates, and so on \u2013 at the rate of one interview per episode. Pozner has a lively and unconstrained style of hosting and he often fires cutting off-the-cuff remarks at his guests. He frequently comments, too, on how the political or economic decision at issue in any of his shows could affect the common people of Russia.[24]\n\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the show stopped airing. The last broadcast was on 21 February 2022, and Pozner declined to explain why the show stopped appearing on television.[25] However, in March 2022, he revealed in his website that Channel One had suspended the program to make room for covering the \"special military operation\".[26]\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]In his final year at Moscow University (1958) Pozner married Valentina Chemberdzhi, a fellow student in the Department of Philology. Two years later they had a daughter, Yekaterina. Since 1990 Yekaterina has lived in Berlin, where she is a professional pianist and composer, working as Katia Tchemberdji.[27] Pozner and his first wife divorced in 1968.[28]\n\nAround the time of his divorce, Pozner met Yekaterina Orlova, who would become his second wife, while they were both working for the Novosti Press Agency's *Sputnik* magazine. They remained married for 35 years. Orlova, an experienced journalist in her own right, was a co-founder of the Pozner School for Television Excellence.[29] Since 2005 Pozner has been linked with Nadezhda Solovyova, \u0430 leading Russian show business impresario.[30]\n\nPozner holds three citizenships: French - by birth,[7] Russian (initially, Soviet) - presumably by descent[7] and US - obtained in the early 1990s by naturalization. In 1968, while attempting to renounce his French nationality so that he could visit France without fear of prosecution for failure to serve in the Algerian War, he was formally notified by the Soviet Foreign Ministry that his Soviet passport, initially granted to him in 1950, at 16, had been issued in error, and that he was not in fact a citizen of the USSR. Much to Pozner's amusement this also technically invalidated, among other things, his membership in the CPSU, his marriage and divorce, his residency permit (*propiska*), and his rank of lieutenant in the reserves.[ citation needed]\n\nPozner is a fan of tennis and baseball. In 1992, he co-founded The Moscow Dummies (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0427\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438, lit. the Moscow Teapots, see *\"chainik\"* for the term), an amateur baseball team.[31] He is a cigar aficionado. He also collects turtle figurines[32] and fountain pens.[33] He enjoys playing charades.\n\n## Views\n\n[edit]Pozner is an atheist.[34][35][36]\n\nHe advocates the right to euthanasia, advocates the legalization of same-sex marriage, and supports the idea of combating drug trafficking and crime among drug addicts by legalizing the sale of drugs.[37][38][39]\n\nHe credits the expansion of NATO since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the post-cold war strategy, and the subsequent lack of attention to specific Russian diplomatic overtures for the creation of Vladimir Putin.[40]\n\n## Controversies\n\n[edit]In April 2021, Pozner was forced to cut his birthday celebration short and flee Georgia after his hotel was blockaded by protesters calling him a \"Kremlin propagandist\". Protesters pelted Pozner's entourage with eggs and were angry with his past statements, where in 2010, Pozner blamed Georgia for the situation that led to the Russo-Georgian War and said: \"Georgia lost [Abkhazia] forever\" and that it \"will never be Georgia's territory again.\" The visit was permitted by the Georgian government, and Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili defended his government's decision to permit the visit, saying that Pozner had a negative test for COVID-19 on entry which was valid and that he did not appear to break any local laws aimed at opposing the Russian military occupation of the breakaway regions. Garibashvili blamed the National Movement and its supporters for the incident, calling the protests \"actions that violated civilized norms and Georgian standards\".[41]\n\n## Books\n\n[edit]- Pozner, Vladimir; Helene G.

The present work has been developed in the context of the German Medical Informatics Initiative, where 29 university hospitals agreed to the usage of the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for their newly established data integration centers. This standard is optimized to describe and exchange medical data but less suitable for standard statistical analysis which mostly requires tabular data formats.\n\n**Objectives**\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analysis by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server.

With the rise of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the need to share large-scale, near real-time patient data has shifted into focus 1 2 3 and there has been increasing activity in building new infrastructures 4 5 for data integration and data sharing.\n\nIn the context of this growing activity, the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard 6 has developed into one of the most popular interoperability standards worldwide. From the creation of FHIR profiles 7 to the mapping 8 and usage of the FHIR standard for data sharing, data visualization, and data quality assessment, 9 10 11 12 13 a vast number of projects using FHIR continues to grow all over the world.\n\nFollowing this trend, the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) 14 established 29 data integration centers in university hospitals across four consortia to integrate EHR data using FHIR. The FHIR standard focuses on the exchange of health care data and defines around 160 so-called resource types, each of which stands for a distinct entity of information that can be transferred using standard web technologies. 15 While FHIR is well-established as a standard in clinical data exchange, for example, for medical applications, Duda et al 16 have found that it is less commonly used in clinical research. Since FHIR is optimized to describe and transfer medical data of individual patients, it is less tailored to statistical analysis of patient cohorts and other applications requiring tabular data. FHIR resources are represented as interlinked JSON or XML objects instead of the matrix-like structures and cannot be handled by most statistical software. The proposed framework is based on the XML representation of FHIR, which is also used throughout this article.\n\nWe developed a framework for extracting and reshaping data from FHIR resources using the well-established XPath expression language, 17 which allows analysts to create tables from FHIR data that can be processed by any standard statistical or other software that expects tabular data. The framework is implemented in the open-source R package 18 fhircrackr 19 and can be downloaded from the comprehensive R archive network. 20\n\nIn the remainder of this article, we will introduce the basics of the FHIR standard followed by a conceptual description of how the fhircrackr framework builds on this standard. Then, we will illustrate the framework with a reproducible example using open access test data and conclude with a discussion of the framework in light of currently ongoing studies, which use real-world EHR data for statistical analyses in several areas of biomedical research.\n\n### FHIR Basics\n\nThe FHIR standard is used to describe data originating from clinical routine documentation. In this standard, all data elements are represented as so-called FHIR resources. A single FHIR resource holds a specific piece of information like a laboratory measurement, demographic information on a patient, or the description of a medical procedure. A full list of currently defined FHIR resources can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/resourcelist.html*\n. Two simplified examples are shown in\nFig. 1\n, where information on a patient and a measurement of her body temperature are represented in the form of a Patient resource and an Observation resource, respectively.\n\nIdeally, every FHIR resource holds the machine-readable information that is needed to interpret the data including its provenance, the actual data point (e.g., the body temperature measured), the metadata (e.g., the unit and date), and references to other resources the data relates to (e.g., the patient the temperature is taken from). The nested structure of the resource is needed because EHR data, like other kinds of data that is exchanged in discrete units, has an inherently nested structure. In the FHIR R4, the most recent version of the standard, there are around 160 resource types, each of them devoted to a specific kind of medical information. In theory, each FHIR resource is individually retrievable from the server, but for statistical analysis, they are mostly downloaded in bundles. A FHIR bundle is a collection of multiple resources that can be exchanged and processed as a single entity. The FHIR standard is a RESTful specification, which uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication. To download data from the server, the standard describes the so-called FHIR Search paradigm, in which the user specifies the scope of the downloaded data with suitable search parameters and downloads the respective resources using HTTP GET or POST. The details of this paradigm are beyond the scope of this article, however, extensive documentation can be found at:\n*https:\/\/www.hl7.org\/fhir\/search.html*\n.\n\nThe structure of the FHIR standard stands in contrast to data formats that are usually employed in data analysis. Most statistical software expects a matrix-like structure, where columns represent features and rows represent observations on the set of features formed by those columns. A single body temperature measurement, for example, could be one cell in a matrix that has patients in rows and measurements of vital signs in columns. In contrast, the FHIR representation of this single cell would be an entire json\/xml object that contains not only the measured temperature value but also references to the patient it is taken from and other metadata. Information that is contained in a single table in a classical data analysis setting is expressed in a large number of interlinked resources when the data is represented in FHIR. Developing a framework bridging the gap between those two representations is the primary goal of this work.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analyses by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should have the following characteristics:\n\nBuild on the communication interface defined by HL7 FHIR.\n\nSupport common authentication protocols used for sensitive data.\n\nBe implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts.\n\nOffer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise.\n\n\n## Methods\n\nTwo steps are necessary to make FHIR data available for analysis: (1) download the data from the server and (2) transform the data into a table format. To perform those tasks, the fhircrackr framework defines a set of classes and related functions, an overview over which can be found in Fig. 2 . Below, we will describe the necessary steps sequentially.\n\n### Downloading FHIR Data\n\nTo access FHIR data, the fhircrackr framework builds on the FHIR Search paradigm defined by HL7. The framework provides functionalities for the construction of FHIR search expressions via the function\n*fhir_url()*\nand uses the function\n*fhir_search()*\nto download the bundles.\n*fhir_search()*\nallows for basic authentication and Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0\n21\n) as well as automatic paging (sequential download of search result bundles) when the result is distributed over several bundles. Downloads can be done via GET or POST, depending on the use case, and can easily be parallelized when necessary. See\nFig. 3\nfor a representation of the downloading workflow. The downloading functions build on well-established functions from the httr-Package,\n22\nbut extend them by providing mechanisms for automatic paging as well as helper functions for building valid FHIR search requests and handling of common errors. The result of the downloading process is a list of FHIR bundles, which is represented as an S4 class\n23\ncalled\n*fhir_bundle_list*\n. Within this list, a single bundle is an object of class\n*fhir_bundle_xml*\n, an S4 class extending\n*xml_document*\nfrom the xml2 R package.\n24\nThe FHIR bundles can be transformed into tables (referred to as \u201cflattening\u201d) as described in the next section.\n\n### Flattening FHIR Data\n\n#### Resource Types\n\nDepending on the type of search request, a FHIR bundle can contain more than one resource type. When the resources are flattened, the fhircrackr framework constructs one table for each resource type, as shown in Fig. 4 . This is necessary because the variability between resources of different types is larger than the variability between resources of the same type. Putting the data of all resource types in a single table would thus create unreasonably large and sparsely populated tables.\n\n#### Elements to Extract\n\nThere are two modes of flattening the resources, depicted in\nFig. 5\n. Either (1) the entire structure is flattened, that is, every element that occurs in at least one of the resources will be turned into a column of the resulting table, or (2) a predefined subset of the elements is extracted from the resources. The former approach requires little knowledge about the individual structure of the resources but can result in very wide and sparse tables. The latter approach, in contrast, requires some knowledge about the structure of the resources, but will result in more concise and densely populated tables.\nFig. 6\nprovides an overview over the workflow of the flattening process: All information needed to flatten the resources is represented in the class\n*fhir_table_description*\n, which contains the type of resource to target (an object of class\n*fhir_resource_type*\n) and a list of XPath 1.0\n17\nexpressions (an object of class\n*fhir_columns*\n) specifying which elements of the resource to extract into the columns of the resulting table. The function\n*fhir_crack()*\nruns the extraction on all resources in the bundles, with one row being created per resource. If a specified element is not present in one of the resources, the corresponding cell in the resulting table is left empty.\n\nThe generic extraction process based on a user-specified XPath scheme ensures that the framework does not depend on any predefined resource structure, apart from it being valid xml. This has the advantage of making the tool compatible with both standard FHIR resources as well as arbitrary extensions to those resources and makes sure that the tool works on all versions of the FHIR standard, like the past STU3, current R4, and future R5 version.\n\n#### Repeating Elements\n\nTo represent complex EHR data adequately, FHIR resources can contain repeating elements, that is, elements with a cardinality greater than one. The FHIR core specification of the Patient resource, 25 for example, defines a 0* cardinality for the element \u201cPatient.address,\u201d meaning that a single Patient resource can contain zero, one, or multiple address elements. Creating a new column for each instance of the element would greatly inflate the resulting table, as a single resource with 10 address elements would result in 10 address columns. This effect worsens as the number of elements with multiple instances increases. To counteract this issue, the fhircrackr default puts values of repeating elements in the same column, separated by a string that can be defined in the table description, as depicted in Fig. 7 . To be able to tell apart which value belongs to which parent element, the fhircrackr can assign an index to each entry, which is surrounded by prespecified brackets. Together with the XPath or header of the column, the indices allow a reconstruction of the original FHIR structure, including the precise position of every element. We are aware that this default behavior violates the first normal form of database normalization, 26 which states that there should be no columns with sets of values. In consultation with various statisticians, we have however adopted the presented solution, since searching such complex fields in the cases considered here is easier to handle in common statistical packages than distributing the values over several columns or tables.\n\nTo resolve columns with sets of values, the fhircrackr framework provides functionalities to automatically split those values, either into a wide format with multiple columns (called casting), or into a long format with multiple rows (called melting). Fig. 8 illustrates the two approaches: In a cast table, the names of each column reflect the original position of the element and each row represents one resource. In a molten table, the number of columns stays the same and multiple entries are spread over several rows. As opposed to casting, melting is done with respect to a specific element (the address element in this example) and values from all other elements (e.g., the id element) are copied into the newly created rows. Fig. 9 represents the workflow of casting or melting a table with multiple entries.\n\nThe steps described so far only aim at making the data available in tabular form. In addition, common techniques of data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization should precede any statistical analysis, which however is beyond the scope of this article. A good summary of those methods specifically for EHR data is given by Yu et al. 27\n\n#### Recreating Resources\n\nApart from turning FHIR resources into flat tables, the fhircrackr framework also allows data to flow in the opposite direction, creating FHIR resources from flat tables. Because the framework is able to remember the original structure of the resources through column headers and indexing of entries, it is possible to recreate the original resources from the flattened tables. This allows the user to selectively remove or add single elements as well as running more complex computations to augment the original FHIR resources before sending them back to a server.\n\n### R Package fhircrackr\n\nWe implemented the above functionalities in a package called fhircrackr using the programming language R\n1\nand published it under the GPL-3 open source license on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (see \u201cSoftware Availability\u201d below). The package requires R Version 4.1.0 or higher and can be run on any operating system that can run R. While the package does not have specific hardware requirements and can be operated on a standard office notebook, the actual requirements regarding RAM and CPU strongly depend on the use case and the scope of the data being processed.\n\n## Results\n\n### Application to Test Data\n\nTo illustrate the basic functionalities of the package, we have set up a simple project on publicly available test data\n28\nat\n*https:\/\/github.com\/POLAR-fhiR\/fhircrackr_examples*\n. In this project, we investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and hypertensive disease (ICD-10 Code I10 - I15) diagnosed as a comorbidity in a small patient cohort. To achieve this, we need to (1) compute the BMI for each patient from downloaded Observation resources containing body weight and body height measurements and (2) relate it to the diagnosis information given in the Encounter and Condition resources of those patients. First, the code example shows how the function\n*fhir_url()*\nis used to build the appropriate FHIR search request which is then sent to the server using\n*fhir_search()*\n. The resulting list of FHIR bundles contains Patient and Observation resources. To flatten those resources into tables, two table descriptions are defined as shown in\nFig. 10\n.\n\nThe function\n*fhir_crack()*\nis then used to create the two tables and after some data preprocessing, the BMI is computed and a list of patient IDs is used to download the associated Encounter and Condition resources. According to the MII implementation guide,\n29\nwhich profiles an Encounter in the German health care system that is used in the test data, the diagnoses of a Patient are referenced in the Encounter resource and there can be multiple diagnoses listed in one encounter, as shown in\nFig. 11\n. The table created from those Encounters will therefore contain multiple entries in the diagnosis columns, as shown in the top row of\nFig. 12\n. Those multiple diagnoses have to be spread over multiple rows using\n*fhir_melt()*\n, as shown in the middle row of\nFig. 12\nand subsequently be freed from indices with\n*fhir_rm_indices()*\nas shown in the bottom row of the figure. Then, they can be filtered for comorbidity diagnoses. Finally, the patients with a hypertension comorbidity diagnosis can be identified and the relationship between hypertension and BMI can be examined with suitable statistical routines.\n\n### Application to Real-World Data\n\nTo date, fhircrackr is used in a number of ongoing studies within the German MII. In the use case POLAR 30 it is used for a distributed analysis in 13 university hospitals to detect health risks in patients with polypharmacy. The clinical trial HELP 31 uses the package to evaluate a decision support system for bloodstream infections in five university hospitals. Several smaller studies (e.g., refs. 32 and 33) showcase the usage of the fhircrackr in publicly available GitHub repositories. 34 35\n\nIn all these applications, the analysis is distributed in the form of plain or dockered R scripts via version control platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or DockerHub. The scripts generate tabular data on different levels of abstraction from simple feature extraction to more complex local aggregation for distributed learning approaches. All these approaches are easy to implement once the FHIR data has been made available as tables in R.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Usage of Real-World Data\n\nThe use of nested information from real-world EHR data in data science applications has demonstrated difficulties, and som\n...\n[truncated]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_GKU9HZ5Ua1ZuJisliUwTVKA7\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36696915\/\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Open Result 0\n# \"fhircrackr\": An R Package Unlocking Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources for Statistical Analysis\n\n-\nPMID:\n**36696915** - PMCID: PMC9876659\n- DOI: 10.1055\/s-0042-1760436\n\n# \"fhircrackr\": An R Package Unlocking Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources for Statistical Analysis\n\n## Abstract\n\n**\nBackground:\n**\nThe growing interest in the secondary use of electronic health record (EHR) data has increased the number of new data integration and data sharing infrastructures.

From May 2011 to August 2012, 77 patients underwent primary SIL surgery for colon cancer by one colorectal surgeon. Among them, 61 patients were one-to-one-matched to control patients who had undergone conventional laparoscopic (CL) surgery with a propensity-matched score, and the outcomes were compared. Two hundred forty-seven patients with colon cancer underwent radical colectomy. Of these, 77 patients underwent SIL colectomy. After matching, there were no significant differences in the general characteristics between the patients undergoing the two types of surgery. Operation time was significantly longer in SIL surgery (139 vs 121 minutes, P = 0.001), but procedure time (107 vs 99 minutes, P = 0.069) was not significantly longer than CL surgery after eliminating closure time (31 vs 22 minutes, P < 0.001) from the operation time. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the two groups (3.3 vs 1.6%, P = 1.000). The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 23 and 22 for SIL and CL surgery, respectively (P = 0.332). The mean follow-up period was 15.7 for the SIL group and 21.4 months for the CL group (P < 0.001) with two recurrences in the SIL group (3.3%) and three recurrences in the CL group (4.9%, P = 1.000). Disease-free survival at 20 months did not differ significantly between the two groups (93.3 vs 94.7%, P = 0.939). SIL for colonic malignancy can be safely applied for various types of operations and can provide equivalent oncologic resection and perioperative outcomes compared with CL surgery.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Step 1 \u2014 locate the clinical study: I searched for a Seoul-based clinical comparison of single-port (single-incision) versus conventional multi-port laparoscopic cancer surgery performed between May 2011 and August 2012.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 verify details: PubMed shows the study with that timeframe (77 patients from May 2011 to August 2012) and comparing single-incision laparoscopic surgery to conventional laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{Perioperative and oncologic outcomes of single-incision laparoscopy compared with conventional laparoscopy for colon cancer: an observational propensity score-matched study}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"deepdive","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":23629.4989585876,"scoring_ms":442.4149990082,"total_ms":24071.9139575958,"info":{"raw_question":"A researcher, whose diverse portfolio includes studies on zebrafish pigmentation, the mechanisms of ciliogenesis involving centrioles, and the genetic underpinnings of conditions like Kallmann syndrome, participated in a clinical evaluation focused on surgical practice.

Hilton Hotels was, at the time, a separate company from Hilton International, and could not operate hotels outside the United States under the Hilton name. The newly named chain solved that problem. Hilton International had already started their own chain of Vista Hotels within the United States, as they faced the same prohibition on operating there under the Hilton name. The first Conrad hotel, the Conrad Jupiters Gold Coast in Australia, opened its doors in 1985.[3]\n\nWhen the two Hilton chains were rejoined in 2005, the need for the Vista and Conrad names vanished. Vista was phased out, while the Conrad brand was retained as a luxury wing of Hilton. Numerous hotels have since been opened under that name in the United States and elsewhere. Conrad was considered the luxury flagship brand in the Hilton Family of Brands, until being supplanted by The Waldorf-Astoria Collection in 2006.\n\n## Properties\n\n[edit]| Present properties | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Name | Location | Country\/Territory | Opened | |\n| Conrad Abu Dhabi Etihad Towers | Abu Dhabi | United Arab Emirates | 2020[4]\n| |\n| Conrad Algarve | Algarve | Portugal | 2012[5]\n| |\n| Conrad Bahrain Financial Harbour | Manama | Bahrain | 2024[6]\n| |\n| Conrad Bali | Bali | Indonesia | 2004[7]\n| |\n| Conrad Bangkok | Bangkok | Thailand | 2003[8]\n| |\n| Conrad Beijing | Beijing | China | 2013[9]\n| |\n| Conrad Bengaluru | Bengaluru | India | 2018[10]\n| |\n| Conrad Bora Bora Nui | Bora Bora | French Polynesia | 2017[11]\n| |\n| Conrad Chia Laguna Sardinia | Sardinia | Italy | 2022[12]\n| |\n| Conrad Dalian | Dalian | China | 2012[13]\n| |\n| Conrad Dubai | Dubai | United Arab Emirates | 2013[14]\n| |\n| Conrad Dublin | Dublin | Ireland | 1989[15]\n| |\n| Conrad Fort Lauderdale Beach | Fort Lauderdale | United States | 2017[16]\n| |\n| Conrad Guangzhou | Guangzhou | China | 2017[17]\n| |\n| Conrad Hamburg | Hamburg | Germany | 2025[18]\n| |\n| Conrad Hangzhou | Hangzhou | China | 2019[19]\n| |\n| Conrad Hangzhou Tonglu | Hangzhou | China | 2019[20]\n| |\n| Conrad Hong Kong | Hong Kong | Hong Kong | 1990[21]\n| |\n| Conrad Indianapolis | Indianapolis | United States | 2006[22]\n| |\n| Conrad Istanbul Bosphorus | Istanbul | Turkey | 1992[23]\n| |\n| Conrad Jiuzhaigou | Jiuzhaigou | China | 2021[24]\n| |\n| Conrad Koh Samui | Ko Samui | Thailand | 2011[25]\n| |\n| Conrad Las Vegas at Resorts World | Las Vegas | United States | 2021[26]\n| |\n| Conrad London St. James | London | United Kingdom | 2014[27]\n| |\n| Conrad Los Angeles | Los Angeles | United States | 2022[28]\n| |\n| Conrad Macao | Macau | Macau | 2012[29]\n| |\n| Conrad Makkah | Mecca | Saudi Arabia | 2016[30]\n| |\n| Conrad Maldives Rangali Island | Rangali | Maldives | 2007[31]\n| |\n| Conrad Manila | Manila | Philippines | 2016[32]\n| |\n| Conrad Nashville | Nashville | United States | 2022[33]\n| |\n| Conrad New York Downtown | New York City | United States | 2012[34]\n| |\n| Conrad Orlando | Orlando | United States | 2024[35]\n| |\n| Conrad Osaka | Osaka | Japan | 2017[36]\n| |\n| Conrad Pune | Pune | India | 2016[37]\n| |\n| Conrad Punta de Mita | Punta Mita | Mexico | 2020[38]\n| |\n| Conrad Rabat Arzana | Rabat | Morocco | 2022[39]\n| |\n| Conrad Seoul | Seoul | South Korea | 2012[40]\n| |\n| Conrad Shanghai | Shanghai | China | 2022[41]\n| |\n| Conrad Shenyang | Shenyang | China | 2019[42]\n| |\n| Conrad Shenzhen | Shenzhen | China | 2023[43]\n| |\n| Conrad Singapore Marina Bay | Central Area | Singapore | 1996[44]\n| |\n| Conrad Singapore Orchard | Central Area | Singapore | 2023[45]\n| |\n| Conrad Tianjin | Tianjin | China | 2019[46]\n| |\n| Conrad Tokyo | Tokyo | Japan | 2005[47]\n| |\n| Conrad Tulum Riviera Maya | Tulum | Mexico | 2022[48]\n| |\n| Conrad Urumqi | Urumqi | China | 2021[49]\n| |\n| Conrad Washington, D.C. | Washington, D.C. | United States | 2019[50]\n| |\n| Conrad Xiamen | Xiamen | China | 2016[51]\n|\n\n| Future properties | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Name | Location | Country\/Territory | Projected opening year | |\n| Conrad Athens The Ilisian | Athens | Greece | 2026[52]\n| |\n| Conrad Hoi An | Hoi An | Vietnam | 2027[53]\n| |\n| Conrad Jaipur | Jaipur | India | 2027[54]\n| |\n| Conrad Jakarta | Jakarta | Indonesia | 2029[55]\n| |\n| Conrad Kuala Lumpur | Kuala Lumpur | Malaysia | 2026[56]\n| |\n| Conrad Nagoya | Nagoya | Japan | 2026[57]\n| |\n| Conrad Nanjing | Nanjing | China | 2027[58]\n| |\n| Conrad Phu Quoc | Phu Quoc | Vietnam | 2027[59]\n| |\n| Conrad Qingcheng Mountain | Chengdu | China | 2027[60]\n| |\n| Conrad Riyadh Laysen Valley | Riyadh | Saudi Arabia | 2026[61]\n| |\n| Conrad Xi'an | Xi'an | China | 2027[62]\n| |\n| Conrad Yokohama | Yokohama | Japan | 2027[63]\n| |\n| Conrad Zhoushan | Zhoushan | China | 2028[64]\n|\n\n## References\n\n[edit]**^**\"Form 10-K Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc\".*sec.report*.

This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's. Within this nation's air arm, a specific numerically designated squadron, which had earlier flown other aircraft types against targets such as projectile launch sites, was eventually equipped with this effective fighter.

The balloons were launched mainly from land; however, some were also launched from *Vulcano*. The Austrians used smaller pilot balloons to determine the correct fuse settings. At least one bomb fell in the city; however, due to the wind changing after launch, most of the balloons missed their target, and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship *Vulcano*.[14][15][16] On 4 July, she had run aground at Malamocco and come under fire from Manfrin Fort. A crew member was killed. She was damaged at her paddlebox. *Vulcan* was refloated the next day with assistance from SMS *Custoza* (1848) and the Austrian steamships *Curtatone* and *Dorotea*.[17]\n\n## Subsequent Service\n\n[edit]In September 1869, a boiler explosion killed eleven of her crew and severely injured many more.[18] On 17 November 1869, she was one of seventy ships, all of which drew less than 13 feet of water, that sailed through the Suez Canal in a procession marking the opening of the canal.[19]\n\nShe remained in service until 1872, and finally struck in 1884 to become a coal hulk.[1]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- ^\n**a****b****c****d****e**The Influence of Air Power Upon History, Walter J.

It made use of cheap, simple balloons filled with hydrogen and carrying either a trailing steel wire to damage high voltage power lines by producing a short circuit, or incendiary devices to start fires in fields, forests and heathland. A total of 99,142 Outward balloons were launched; about half carried incendiaries and half carried trailing wires.[a]\n\nCompared to Japan's better-known fire balloons, Outward balloons were crude. They had to travel a much shorter distance so they flew at a lower altitude \u2013 16,000 ft (4,900 m), compared with 38,000 ft (12,000 m) \u2013 and had only a simple mechanism to regulate altitude by means of dropping ballast or venting lifting gas. This meant the balloons were simple to mass-produce and only cost 35 shillings each (approximately equivalent to \u00a3121 in 2023[3]). The free flying balloon attacks were highly successful. Although difficult to assess exactly, their economic impact on Germany was far in excess of the cost to the British government.[2][4][5]\n\n## History and development\n\n[edit]Because there was concern over what could happen if a barrage balloon accidentally got loose, in 1937 the British carried out a study on the damage that may be caused by a balloon-carried wire hitting power lines.[2] These concerns were evidently borne out when early in 1940, the Air Vice Marshal Balloon Command, the organisation responsible for the barrage balloons, wrote that \"Since the outbreak of the war, I have had constant complaints from the electricity distributors regarding the damage done in this country by [barrage] balloons that have broken away from their moorings\". to which he added \"...advantage might be taken of this to impede and inconvenience the enemy\".[6]\n\nIt was proposed that bomb-laden balloons could be launched from France. Their position would be tracked by radio triangulation and the bombs would be released by radio control when the balloon drifted over a worthwhile target.[7] This plan was never put into action; objections included that \"attacks of this nature should not be originated from a cricketing country\" and a concern that the enemy might retaliate with similar weapons.[2] The idea became redundant when defeat in the Battle of France put possible launch sites out of British control.\n\nWe may make a virtue of our misfortune.\n\n\n[2]\n\nOn the night of 17\/18 September 1940, a gale broke loose a number of British barrage balloons and carried them across the North Sea. In Sweden and Denmark, they damaged power lines, disrupted railways and knocked down the antenna for the Swedish International radio station.[8][2] Five balloons were reported to have reached Finland.[9] A report on the damage and confusion reached the British War Cabinet on 23 September 1940. Winston Churchill then directed that the use of free-flying balloons as weapons against Germany should be investigated.[9][6] The Air Ministry initially produced a negative report, possibly because the Ministry of Aircraft Production felt balloons would be ineffective weapons and would consume too many resources.[2]\n\nTO SUM UP - If D.B.D. [Director of Boom Defences] is given a free hand, he is prepared to guarantee that he could produce an incendiary balloon attack organisation for operating from an East Coast area (say Harwich) which could be built up using women operatives, coal gas \/and\/or hydrogen and to produce the incendiaries, balloons and equipment etc. without recognisable interference to any other service activity, but from the experience obtained in attempting to operate F.B.B. in collaboration with the Air Ministry, it is clear that it should be a Naval and not a combined Naval and Air-Force undertaking.\n\n\n[2]\n\nThe Admiralty took up the idea with more enthusiasm. In particular, Captain Gerald Banister, Director of Boom Defence and a proponent of using balloons as a weapon of offence, pressed the point. The meteorological considerations \u2013 including the possibility that the weather might favour the enemy retaliating in kind \u2013 were carefully investigated and found to be highly favourable; winds above 16,000 feet (4,900 m) tend to blow from west to east, making it difficult for the Germans to retaliate with similar balloons.[10]\n\nOf particular interest was the possibility of damaging Germany's electricity distribution network by shorting high-voltage overhead power lines with thin wires dragged by balloons. The results of investigations were favourable: trials showed that even a thin steel wire, much thinner than that used to tether the static barrage balloons, when drawn in sliding contact across two or more phases, could cause an arc as long as 15 ft (4.6 m) and that arc would be maintained until the circuit breaker opened. In some cases, the arc's heat could melt the aluminium outer layers and then the reinforcing steel centre strands of the conductors. Even if the cable was not severed, the conductors would be weakened so that they would be susceptible to breaking due to increased electrical demand or normal weather events such as wind, snow and ice.[6]\n\nInvestigations revealed that it was common in pre-war Germany to use a Petersen coil as protection against earthing; this design was effective against a short between a high voltage cable and earth but relatively vulnerable to a short between different phases. A short between phases could result in damage, not just to a cable but to transformers and the circuit breakers.[11][6] The Admiralty ran trials using surplus spherical latex meteorological balloons about 8 ft (2.4 m) in diameter when inflated. Calculations based on the trials predicted that there would be between a 10% to 75% chance of a balloon's wire coming into contact with a high-voltage overhead line during a 30 mi (48 km) flight along the ground.\n\nBalloons could also carry incendiaries. Large areas of pine forest and heathland in Germany made the countryside vulnerable to random incendiary attack and it was hoped that the Germans would be forced to assign large numbers of people to the task of fire watching, possibly diverting them from more productive war-work. The Admiralty concluded that the balloons could be produced at very little cost; many of the important parts already existed as surplus materials and despite the needs of conventional barrage balloons, there was plenty of hydrogen gas with which to fill the balloons.[2] The balloons could be used with a small number of British personnel who would face minimal risks.\n\n## Design\n\n[edit]The balloons used were surplus weather balloons of which the Navy had a stock of 100,000 all carefully stored in French chalk.[11] Using this surplus was important to the practicality of Operation Outward because white latex rubber from which they were made was an important war material that was in short supply.[12] The balloons were about 8 ft (2.4 m) in diameter when inflated.[b] They carried a simple timing and regulating mechanism that was based upon a design developed for Operation Albino \u2013 a plan to use somewhat larger latex balloons as anti-aircraft weapons.[c]\n\nAt launch, a slow-burning fuse was lit; its length was calibrated to the estimated time to arrive over German-controlled territory. At first, the balloon rose rapidly and expanded in size until an internal cord tightened, preventing further increase in altitude beyond 25,000 ft (7,600 m) by releasing some gas; the balloon would then begin a slow descent due to the hydrogen gradually leaking away.[6] After a while, the slow burning fuse would release a bung in a can of mineral oil; as the oil slowly dripped out, the balloon's payload would lighten, arresting its descent. The same slow-burning fuse was also used to release the balloon's weapon. There were a number of payload designs designated: *wire*, *beer*, *jelly*, *socks*, *lemon*, and *jam*.\n\n*Wire*\n\n[edit]About half of the Outward balloons carried the *wire* payload. In the case of the *wire*, the slow burning fuse would burn through the cord that held the trailing wire. The trailing wire consisted of about 700 ft (210 m) of 1\u204416 in (1.6 mm) diameter hemp cord with a breaking strength of 40 lb (18 kg). The hemp cord was attached to 300 ft (91 m) of 0.072 in (1.8 mm) diameter (15 gauge) steel wire.[6] Tests had revealed that the main reason for the trailing wire getting caught up in ground obstacles was \"springiness\" at the end of the wires; this was addressed by obtaining special straightened wire.[11]\n\nAt the same time as the trailing wire was deployed, a stopper on the canister of mineral oil was released so that it would assist in maintaining altitude by slowly dripping out and lightening the load on the balloon.[6] It was calculated that the balloon should have a slightly negative lift of about 1 lb (0.45 kg) so that the balloon would descend until a short length of the wire had its weight taken by the ground. The long length of hemp cord allowed the balloon to maintain an altitude of about 1,000 ft (300 m) which would reduce the chance of the balloon being becalmed in still air.\n\nThe plan was that the wire tail would be dragged for about 30 mi (48 km) across the land and eventually encounter a high-voltage transmission line.[6] A phase-to-phase short circuit would be initiated; during trials, arcs 15 ft (4.6 m) long were initiated by the wire.[6] The arc would burn for some time before the transmission line protection operated; there was a good chance the circuit breaker would be damaged and the conductors might burn through due to arcing. This could cause a line to collapse and require repairs. German efforts to protect transmission lines from attack were unsuccessful: neither a new type of line conductor clamp nor different over-current protection settings had any useful effect.[6]\n\n*Beer*, *jelly* and *socks*\n\n[edit]*Beer*, *jelly* and *socks* were incendiary devices.\n\n*Beer* consisted of a cylindrical metal container 8+1\u20442 in (22 cm) in diameter and 9 in (23 cm) long containing seven or eight half-pint bottles.[16] Each bottle was a Self-igniting phosphorus (SIP) grenade[15] \u2013 it contained white phosphorus, benzene, water and a strip of raw rubber, two in (5.1 cm) long, which dissolved and formed a layer. After a delay caused by a slow burning fuse, the metal container was tipped open and its contents allowed to fall out. Around the neck of each bottle was a small metal sleeve that held a heavy ball about one in (25 mm) in diameter.[16] The ball was attached to a strip of canvas; this ensured that when the bottles dropped they fell the right way round.[16][17] The SIP grenades would spontaneously ignite on shattering.\n\n*Jelly* were cans of incendiary jelly.[18] Each cuboid can measured about 11+1\u20442 in \u00d7 6+1\u20442 in \u00d7 4 in (29 cm \u00d7 17 cm \u00d7 10 cm) and contained one imp gal (4.5 L) of jelly.[19] A release mechanism and a fuse were provided; on ignition a fireball erupted with a radius of about 20 ft (6.1 m).[19]\n\n*Socks* were long thin canvas bags of incendiary material each weighing about 6 lb (2.7 kg). Socks were packed with wood wool, bound with wire and soaked in boiling paraffin wax.[2][17] Each Outward balloon could carry three socks. The bundle measured about 27 in \u00d7 10 in \u00d7 10 in (690 mm \u00d7 250 mm \u00d7 250 mm).[19] When dropped, socks formed a V\u2011shaped sausage designed to catch in the crown of a tree.[2] Fuses were inserted in each end of the device and it would burn from each end for 15 minutes.[2] In 1941 the Royal Navy had a stock of 10,000 such socks already fused and ready to be used and another 20,000 bodies that could be brought forward as required.[2][d]\n\n*Lemon* and *jam*\n\n[edit]All the payloads that are clearly code named and described are either a trailing wire or an incendiary. *Small yellow bombs* left over from Operation Albino were also used and it seems likely that these are identified by one of these code words.[20][21] It is possible that the other was used to drop leaflets \u2013 there are occasional, vague mentions of leaflet drops in the records.[2]\n\n## Deployment\n\n[edit]After a lengthy bureaucratic struggle between the opponents in the Air Ministry and proponents in the Admiralty, the British Chiefs of Staff gave the go\u2011ahead in September 1941 and a launch site was set up, based at HMS *Beehive*, a Royal Navy shore establishment near Felixstowe in Suffolk. The actual balloon releases took place at the Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club.[22] The first launches took place on 20 March 1942. Within days, the British were receiving reports of forest fires near Berlin and Tilsit in East Prussia.[23]\n\nThe personnel that launched the balloons were six Royal Navy and Royal Marine officers, 80 Royal Marines, 7 Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) officers and 140 non-commissioned WRNS.[2] The operation also required the assistance of the RAF Balloon Command (that supplied and delivered the hydrogen) and the Naval Meteorological Services.[2] The balloons were inflated using hydrogen from pressure cylinders that were brought to the launch site by truck. They were inflated inside three-sided tents or windbreaks. During inflation, it was necessary to keep the latex wet with a water spray \u2013 otherwise, friction between the balloon and the tent canvas might have caused the hydrogen to ignite. The inflated balloons were conveyed by hand to a dispersal point, where their payload was attached.\n\nBalloon operations could be hazardous, and there were many instances of launch crew requiring hospital treatment for burns caused by exploding balloons or by mishandling incendiary payloads.[24] The WRNS were equipped with \"flash-proof jacket & hood (\u00bd mica & \u00bd fine copper gauze over the face) + protective cream on hands and fire-proof black gloves\".[e]\n\nFor security reasons, the Felixstowe launch crews were referred to as a \"Boom-defence\" unit, a cover story that was partly true as they were put to work maintaining anti-submarine nets when weather conditions were not right for balloon launches. The Felixstowe golf club site had a number of Lewis Guns for anti-aircraft defence, which the WRNS women were trained to operate, occasionally releasing balloons for the purpose of target practice.[26]\n\n| Period | Wire | Beer | Jelly | Socks | Lemon | Jam | Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| \"ordinary\" (20 March 1942 to 7 February 1944) | 54,369\n|\n24,075\n|\n5,900\n|\n9,291\n|\n-\n|\n-\n|\n96,625\n|\n| \"trickle\" (29 April 1944 to 4 September 1944) | 230\n|\n2,808\n|\n1,596\n|\n253\n|\n899\n|\n739\n|\n6,517\n|\n| Total | 54,599\n|\n26,883\n|\n7,496\n|\n9,644\n|\n899\n|\n739\n|\n99,142 |\n\n## Effects\n\n[edit]The British were keen to assess the effectiveness of Operation Outward. Intercepts of Luftwaffe communications soon showed German fighters were trying to shoot down balloons. This encouraged the British as it was felt that the harassment value on German air defences alone justified Operation Outward \u2013 it cost the Germans more, in fuel and wear and tear on aircraft, to destroy each balloon than it cost the British to make them. Later, reports were received revealing damage to electricity supplies and fires in forests and on farms.[27] Most of these reports were gleaned from newspaper reports in Denmark, France and other occupied countries where the German authorities tried to paint the British attacks in an unfavourable light.[27]\n\nAfter the war, German records revealed that the trailing wire attacks had caused the Germans considerable inconvenience with electricity supplies frequently being interrupted and significant damage to the electrical distribution network.[2] A 1946 report concluded that, based on available records, \u00a31,500,000 of damage was done (approximately equivalent to \u00a369 million in 2023[3]).[4] The report also stated that the actual amount of damage must have been far higher because the records were incomplete with no available records for the Russian zone and all records becoming less reliable after 1943.[4] The Germans had attempted to record interrupts to the lower voltage lines but the incidents were so frequent that the recording was abandoned.[2] In addition to sending up fighters, the Germans used anti-aircraft fire against the balloons, sometimes shut down electric cables when an attack was anticipated, and modified the circuit breakers on high voltage networks.[2]\n\nIn July 1942, a second launch site was set up at Oldstairs Bay near Dover.[23] On 12 July 1942, a wire-carrying balloon struck a 110 kV power line near Leipzig. A failure in the circuit breaker at the B\u00f6hlen power station caused a fire that destroyed the station;[1] this was Outward's greatest success.[6]\n\nThe effects of the incendiary attacks were very difficult to assess \u2013 it could be difficult to tell whether any particular fire was caused by *Outward* or by an accident, sabotage, or aircraft-dropped incendiary. Intelligence sources, including reports from newspapers printed in occupied Europe, indicated that some fires had definitely been caused by Outward.[27] Outward caused damage in neutral countries \u2013 on the night of 19\/20 January 1944, two trains collided at Laholm in Sweden after an Outward balloon knocked out electrical lighting on the railway.[1] Changing winds could also blow balloons back to the United Kingdom. On one occasion, a balloon knocked out the electricity supply to the town of Ipswich.[28]In addition, failures in the altitude adjustment mechanism caused such balloons to fall in Belgium in an area ranging from Tournai to Andenne.[29]\n\n## End of the operation\n\n[edit]In August 1942, launches reached 1,000 per day and later increased to attacks involving up to 1,800 balloons all launched over a period of three to four hours.[27] Balloon launches continued, though they were frequently suspended when there were large air raids on Germany as it was feared the balloons might damage Allied bombers.[27] From May 1944 it was decided to change tactics because of increased Allied aircraft activity. The mass balloon launches were stopped and replaced with a \"trickle\" of balloons launched from three sites at ten-minute intervals throughout daylight hours.[27]\n\nOnly 2% of the balloons were to be of the trailing wire type.[27] The \"trickle system\" was not thought to be a significant threat to Allied aircraft so it could go on uninterrupted.[27] The trickle system simplified the hydrogen supply requirements of the launch sites and released transport vehicles and compressed gas cylinders needed for operations against German V-1 flying bombs and for the Normandy landings.[27] The last balloons were launched on 4 September 1944.[1]\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- Footnotes\n\n**^**Sources agree on the total number but vary as to the exact proportions of wire and incendiary payloads, Peebles gives a little more than half to incendiaries,[1]National Archive records vary slightly but give a little more than half to trailing wires.[2]**^**An eight foot diameter hydrogen filled balloon might be expected to lift 18.66 lb (8.46 kg).[13]**^**Operation Albino was a plan to use many free balloons to form an aerial minefield. Each Albino balloon would carry a long wire with a parachute at the bottom and a*small yellow bomb*at the top. If an aircraft caught the wire, the drag of the parachute would cause the bomb to be drawn down onto the aircraft where it would explode on contact. Albino was tried but was not particularly successful.[14][15]**^**If one Outward balloon carried three socks then the 9,644*sock*payloads mentioned in the records would have almost exactly used this supply.**^**WRNS Cecilia Banister quoted by Finley.[25]**^**The figures in the table come directly from a document in the National Archive.

Being already equipped with aeroplanes and manned by pilots and air mechanics, No. 2 (Aeroplane) Company was thus the first British, Empire or Commonwealth independent military unit to operate heavier-than-air flying machines, hence the squadron motto *Tertius primus erit* (Latin for 'The third shall be the first').[2] On 5 July 1912, two members of the squadron, Captain Eustace Loraine and Staff Sergeant Wilson were killed in an aircraft crash, making them the first RFC fatalities.[3] In 1913, the squadron deployed to Halton in Buckinghamshire to support the land manoeuvres of the Household Division. A temporary airfield was set up on what later became RAF Halton's Maitland Parade Square. During the exercise, the squadron flew a number of reconnaissance sorties and staged the first confrontation between an airship and an aeroplane.[4]\n\nAs well as training and reconnaissance duties, No. 3 Squadron spent much of its time carrying out experimental work and working out tactics, including how to direct artillery fire from the air.[5] In late 1913, the squadron carried out trials in the use of machine guns from aircraft, which eventually resulted in the selection of the Lewis gun for use by the RFC and from early in 1914 carried out trials in airborne photography, helping to develop the cameras that would be used by the RFC in the First World War. Other trials included the first night flights carried by the RFC.[6]\n\nThe squadron was sent to France on the outbreak of the First World War, arriving at Amiens on 13 August 1914, carrying out its first reconnaissance mission, piloted by Captain Philip Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 on 19 August.[7][8] The squadron initially operated primarily in the reconnaissance role using a variety of aircraft types.[7][9] In December 1914, the squadron started to receive Morane-Saulnier L parasol-wing aircraft, and was almost solely equipped with the Morane Parasol by April 1915.[10] It started to replace its Morane-Saulnier L with the improved Morane-Saulnier LA, which had ailerons instead of the wing warping of the earlier aircraft, in September 1915, and all its Parasols were Type LAs by December 1915.[11] In 1916 it supplemented its Parasols with a flight of four Morane-Saulnier BB biplanes,[12] and from the middle of 1916 replaced its Morane-Saulnier LAs with Morane-Saulnier P parasols.[13]\n\nThe English ace James McCudden served as a mechanic and occasional observer with 3 Squadron in the early part of the war, leaving the squadron in January 1916 for flying training.[14] Cecil Lewis, author of *Sagittarius Rising* joined the squadron in May 1915 and flew Morane Parasols with the squadron during the Somme offensive.[15][16] Later in October 1917, with the introduction of Sopwith Camels, a fighter\/scout role was taken on, with 59 enemy aircraft being claimed by the end of the war. The squadron disbanded on 27 October 1919.[17][18]\n\nThere were nine flying aces among its ranks, including Douglas John Bell, George R. Riley, Will Hubbard, Adrian Franklyn, Hazel LeRoy Wallace, Lloyd Hamilton, David Hughes, Neil Smuts and William H Maxted.[19]\n\n### Interwar period (1920\u20131938)\n\n[edit]No. 3 Squadron reformed in India on 1 April 1920 as a fighter squadron equipped with Sopwith Snipes, being disbanded again 30 September 1921.[1] It was immediately reformed the next day at RAF Leuchars, Scotland, as a naval observation squadron equipped with the Airco DH.9A, receiving the Westland Walrus and Avro Bison. The squadron moved to RAF Gosport on 8 November 1922, before being disbanded to form three independent flights on 1 April 1923.[17][18]\n\nIt reformed as a fighter squadron with Snipes a year later on 1 April 1924, operating a succession of different types, based in the UK, including the Gloster Gladiator.[20] The only highlight of these years was the 1935 deployment to the Sudan during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia.[18]\n\n### Second World War (1939\u20131945)\n\n[edit]At the start of the Second World War No. 3 Squadron was posted as part of Fighter Command to RAF Biggin Hill equipped with the Hawker Hurricane. It briefly deployed to France in support of the British Expeditionary Force following the German attack on the West in 1940, being forced to withdraw after ten days, having claimed 60 German aircraft for the loss of 21 of its own. On 21 July 1940, \"B\" flight was detached to form the nucleus of the newly formed No. 232 Squadron. Once back up to strength, No. 3 Squadron was used as air defence for the Royal Naval base at Scapa Flow, remaining in Scotland until April 1941, based at the RAF Wick in the north of Scotland.[21] In June 1941, the squadron moved from RAF Martlesham Heath to RAF Stapleford Tawney operating the four-cannon Hurricane II in 'Rhubarb' attacks on defended ground targets and shipping in northern France and Belgium.[22]\n\nThe squadron then co-operated with \"Turbinlite\" searchlight equipped Douglas Havocs in the night fighter role.[18]\n\nIn February 1943, it re-equipped with the Hawker Typhoon for fighter-bomber and anti-shipping strikes. It re-equipped in March 1944 with the new Hawker Tempest fighter, operating over the Normandy beach-head and against German V1 flying bombs, claiming 288 V-1s shot down.[18]\n\nIt then deployed across the Channel, flying as part of the Second Tactical Air Force fighting through the low countries and into Germany. Amongst its pilots was Flight Lieutenant Pierre Clostermann, who flew with the squadron from March 1945 until the end of the war in Europe.[17][18]\n\n### Post-war and Cold War (1946\u20131968)\n\n[edit]No. 3 Squadron converted to jet aircraft with the de Havilland Vampire F.1 during 1948, in Germany, where it had remained after moving there in the latter stages of the war. The Canadair Sabre F.4 and Hawker Hunter F.4 replaced the Vampire during the 1950s. This was followed by the Gloster Javelin FAW.4 and then a conversion to the English Electric Canberra B(I).8 bomber. Most of its time operating Canberras was spent at RAF Geilenkirchen, moving to RAF Laarbruch in January 1968.[23]\n\n### Harrier (1972\u20132005)\n\n[edit]No. 3 Squadron's association with the Hawker Siddeley Harrier began in the early 1970s with the Harrier GR.1 at RAF Wildenrath where it reformed from Canberras to Harriers and they joined No. 4 Squadron and No. 20 Squadron equipped with the Harrier GR.1 and were already operational at Wildenrath. The squadron received the later GR.3 and GR.5 model Harriers successively at RAF G\u00fctersloh, finally receiving the GR.7 and relocating to RAF Laarbruch in 1992. In 1999, with the drawdown of the RAF in Germany, the squadron moved back to the UK along with its sister squadron No. 4 Squadron. The two squadrons operated at RAF Cottesmore, being joined by the other Harrier operator, No. 1 Squadron, in summer 2000.[24]\n\nAs part of Joint Force Harrier, No. 3 Squadron operated alongside the British Aerospace Sea Harrier FA2 operated by the Fleet Air Arm and was capable of deployment from the Royal Navy aircraft carriers. Operations included Operation Allied Force in Kosovo in 1999, Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone in 2000 and Operation Telic in Iraq in 2003.[25] In August 2004, it was announced that six Harriers would be deployed to Afghanistan in support of NATO forces.[26]\n\n### Eurofighter Typhoon (2006\u2013present)\n\n[edit]After the Harrier GR7 had been passed to the Fleet Air Arm to be used by the recommissioned No. 800 Naval Air Squadron, No. 3 Squadron moved to RAF Coningsby on 1 April 2006 where it re-equipped with the Eurofighter Typhoon and became the first operational front line RAF Typhoon squadron in July 2007.[27] The squadron began to take over Quick Reaction Alert responsibilities from the Panavia Tornado F3 on 29 June 2007.[28]\n\nIn March 2011, the squadron deployed to Southern Italy to take part in Operation Ellamy in Libya in support of UN Security Council Resolution 1973.[29]\n\nIn May 2012, four Typhoons were deployed to RAF Northolt in an air defence role covering the duration of the London 2012 Summer Olympics, the first time RAF fighters had been stationed at the station since the Second World War.[30]\n\nBetween April and August 2017, four of the squadron's Typhoons were deployed to Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Air Base, Romania as part of Operation Biloxi. During this deployment, the squadron fighters flew on over 280 training sorties and one sortie in response to Russian Air Force activity over the Black Sea.[31]\n\nDuring March 2018, six Typhoons from No. 3 Squadron deployed to Andravida Air Base in Greece for *Exercise Iniochos 18*. It was the first time that RAF Typhoons had participated in the annual NATO exercise.[32]\n\nOn 3 September 2019, No. 3 Squadron deployed to Oman for two weeks to participate in Exercise Magic Carpet.[33][34]\n\n## Aircraft operated\n\n[edit]- Sopwith Camel (September 1917 \u2013 February 1919)\n- Sopwith Snipe (April 1920 \u2013 October 1921; April 1924 \u2013 October 1925)\n- Airco DH.9A (October 1921 \u2013 October 1922)\n- Westland Walrus (January 1922 \u2013 April 1923)\n- Hawker Woodcock II (July 1925 \u2013 September 1928)\n- Gloster Gamecock I (August 1928 \u2013 July 1929)\n- Bristol Bulldog II (May 1929 \u2013 December 1932)\n- Bristol Bulldog IIA (February 1931 \u2013 January 1932; December 1932 \u2013 June 1937)\n- Gloster Gladiator I (March 1937 \u2013 March 1939; July 1938 \u2013 July 1939)\n- Hawker Hurricane I (March\u2013July 1938; July 1939 \u2013 April 1941)\n- Hawker Hurricane IIA\/IIB (April \u2013 November 1941)\n- Hawker Hurricane IIC (April 1941 \u2013 May 1943)\n- Hawker Typhoon IB (February 1943 \u2013 April 1944)\n- Hawker Tempest V (February 1944 \u2013 April 1948)\n- de Havilland Vampire F.1 (April 1948 \u2013 May 1949)\n- de Havilland Vampire FB.5 (May 1949 \u2013 May 1953)\n- Canadair Sabre F.2\/F.4 (May 1953 \u2013 June 1956)\n- Hawker Hunter F.4 (May 1956 \u2013 June 1957)\n- Gloster Javelin FAW.4 (January 1959 \u2013 December 1960)\n- English Electric Canberra B(I).8 (January 1961 \u2013 January 1972)\n- Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR.1A\/T.2 (January 1972 \u2013 March 1977)\n- Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR.3 (December 1973\n[35]- January 1990)[36] - Hawker Siddeley Harrier T.4 (March 1977 \u2013 May 1989)\n- BAe Harrier GR.5\/T.4 (May 1989 \u2013 February 1992)\n- BAe Harrier GR.7\/T.10 (February 1992 \u2013 31 March 2006)\n- BAE Harrier GR.7A (2004 \u2013 31 March 2006)\n- Eurofighter Typhoon F2 (1 April 2006 \u2013 July 2008)\n- Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4\/T3 (3 June 2011 \u2013 present)\n\n## Heritage\n\n[edit]### Badge and motto\n\n[edit]Approved by King George VI in September 1937, the squadron's badge features a cockatrice on a monolith against a yellow and green background. The monolith relates to the ancient monument Stonehenge, which is near Larkhill where the squadron was first established in 1912. The mythological cockatrice is described as being the first creature to fly, reflecting the squadron's status as the first British, Empire or Commonwealth unit to operate \u2018heavier-than-air\u2019 aircraft. This is also reflected in the squadron\u2019s motto *Tertius primus erit* (Latin for 'The third shall be the first').[37][38]\n\n### Call signs\n\n[edit]As of March 2025, aircraft operated by No. 3 Squadron use the following peacetime air traffic control call signs within UK airspace: *Brutal, Chaos, Hulk, Nightmare,* and *Rampage.*[39]\n\n## Battle honours\n\n[edit]The battle honours awarded to No. 3 Squadron.

(March 2010) |\n\n**Operation Diver** was the British code name for the V-1 flying bomb campaign launched by the German *Luftwaffe* in 1944 against London and other parts of Britain. Diver was the code name for the V-1, against which the defence consisted of anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons and fighter aircraft.\n\nThe British Double-Cross System used double agents to plant false information about the accuracy of the V-1 bombardment. Anti-aircraft guns proved the most effective form of defence in the later stages of the campaign, with the aid of radar-based technology and the proximity fuse. The V-1 campaign from ground launch sites ended by the middle of 1944 with the Allied occupation of the launch sites.\n\n## Diver Plan\n\n[edit]The Diver Plan was prepared in early 1944 following the first reports of the weapon in April 1943 and the discovery of its intended launch sites in late 1943. The plan had to be flexible enough to cover the anticipated assault on Britain and the needs of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Europe. The V-1 offensive began on the sixth day after the D-Day landings, when the first sighting of an incoming V-1 approaching the English coast was reported by the Royal Observer Corps with the message \"Diver, Diver, Diver\". Defences that had been guarding the embarkation ports for the invasion were redeployed against the V-1.\n\n## Defences\n\n[edit]### Anti-aircraft guns\n\n[edit]Anti-aircraft guns were redeployed in several moves: first in mid-June 1944 from positions on the North Downs to the south coast of England; then a cordon closing the Thames Estuary to attacks from the east. In September 1944 a new linear defence line was formed on the coast of East Anglia, and finally in December there was a further layout along the Lincolnshire\u2013Yorkshire coast. The deployments were prompted by the ever-changing approach tracks of the missiles which were determined by the Allied advance through Western Europe.\n\nAnti-aircraft gunners found that such small, fast-moving targets were difficult to hit. At first, it took an average of 2,500 shells to bring down a V-1. The average altitude of the V-1, between 2,000\u20133,000 ft (610\u2013910 m) was in a narrow band above the optimum engagement height range for light 40 mm Bofors guns. The rate of traverse of the standard British QF 3.7 inch mobile gun was too slow for the heights at which V-1s flew and static gun installations with faster traverses had to be built at great cost. The development of centimetric (roughly 30 GHz frequency) gun laying radars based on the cavity magnetron and the development of the proximity fuze helped to neutralise the advantages of speed and size which the V-1 possessed. In 1944 Bell Labs started delivery of an anti-aircraft predictor fire-control system based around an analogue computer, which supplanted the previous electro-mechanical Kerrison Predictor) just in time for use in the campaign.\n\n#### Technological advances\n\n[edit]By mid-August 1944, the threat was all but overcome by the expedited arrival of two enormously effective electronic aids for anti-aircraft guns, the first developed by the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT Rad Lab) radar-based automatic gun-laying (using, among others, the SCR-584 radar) and the proximity fuze. Both of these had been requested by Anti-Aircraft Command and arrived in numbers, starting in June 1944, just as the guns reached their free-firing positions on the coast. Seventeen percent of all flying bombs entering the coastal gun belt were destroyed by guns in the first week on the coast. This rose to 60 per cent by 23 August and 74 per cent in the last week of the month, when on one day 82 per cent were shot down. The rate increased from one V-1 for every 2,500 shells fired to one for every hundred.\n\n### Barrage balloons\n\n[edit]Barrage balloons were also deployed against the missiles but the leading edges of the V-1's wings were equipped with balloon cable cutters and fewer than 300 V-1s are known to have been destroyed by hitting cables.\n\n### Aircraft\n\n[edit]Parts of the south of England, over which the V-1s were expected to fly, were allocated specifically for fighter operations. Most fighter aircraft were too slow to catch a V-1 except in a dive and even when intercepted, the V-1 was difficult to bring down. Machine-gun bullets had little effect on the sheet steel structure and 20 mm cannon shells were explosive projectiles; detonating the warhead could destroy the fighter as well. The V-1 was nearly immune to conventional air-combat techniques because of its design, which dispensed with a pilot and piston engine with a cooling system. One hit on the pilot or oxygen system can damage or shoot down a conventional aeroplane but there is no pilot in a cruise missile. The Argus pulse jet of the V-1 could be shot full of holes and still provide sufficient thrust for flight. The only vulnerable point of the engine was the valve array at the front. The only other vulnerable points on the V-1 were the bomb detonators and the line from the fuel tank; three very small targets inside the fuselage. An explosive shell from a fighter's cannon or anti-aircraft gun hitting the warhead was most effective.\n\nWhen the attacks began in mid-June 1944 there were fewer than 30 Hawker Tempests in No. 150 Wing RAF to defend against them. Few other aircraft had the low-altitude speed to be effective. Early attempts to intercept V-1s often failed but techniques were rapidly developed. These included using the airflow over an interceptor's wing to raise one wing of the V-1, by sliding the wing tip under the bomb's wing and bringing it to within 6 in (150 mm) of the lower surface. Done properly, the airflow would tip the wing of the V-1 upwards, overriding the bomb's gyros and sending it out of control into dive.[1] At least three V-1s were destroyed this way.\n\nThe Tempest wing was built up to over 100 aircraft by September; P-51 Mustangs and Griffon-engined Spitfire XIVs were tuned to make them almost fast enough and during the short summer nights the Tempests shared operations with de Havilland Mosquitos. Modified P-47M Thunderbolts (half of their fuel tanks removed, half of their 0.5in [12.7 mm] machine-gun armament, all external fittings and all their armour plate removed) were also pressed into service. There was no need for radar in good weather \u2014 at night the V-1's engine could be heard from 9.9 mi (16 km) or more away and the exhaust plume was highly visible. In poor visibility, radar-equipped Fleet Air Arm (FAA) Fairey Firefly night fighters of 746 Naval Air Squadron based at RAF Ford intercepted the bombs. Wing Commander Roland Beamont had the harmonisation 20 mm cannon on his Tempest changed to converge at 300 yd (270 m), which was so successful that the other aircraft in 150 Wing were also modified.\n\nIn daylight, V-1 chases were often chaotic failures, until a special defence zone between London and the coast was declared in which only the fastest fighters were permitted. Between June and mid-August 1944, the small number of Tempests shot down 638 flying bombs. One Tempest pilot, Squadron Leader Joseph Berry of 501 Squadron, destroyed fifty-nine V-1s and Beamont destroyed 31. Next most successful was the Mosquito (428), Spitfire XIV (303) and Mustang, (232). All other aircraft types combined added 158. The experimental jet-powered Gloster Meteor, which was rushed half-ready into service in July 1944 to fight the V-1s, had ample speed but suffered from unreliable armament and accounted for only 13 bombs destroyed.\n\n#### Squadrons on anti-Diver operations\n\n[edit]- Fighter Interception Unit (detachment), Tempest V, RAF Manston (Kent), merged with 501 Squadron)\n[2] - No. 3 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Newchurch (Kent)\n[2] - No. 56 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Newchurch\n[2] - No. 80 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Manston\n[2] - No. 91 Squadron RAF, Spitfire XIV, RAF West Malling (Kent)\n[2] - No. 96 Squadron RAF, Mosquito NF Mk XIII, RAF Ford (West Sussex)\n[2] - No. 129 Squadron RAF, Mustang III, RAF Brenzett (Kent)\n[2] - No. 165 Squadron RAF, Spitfire IXb + 25 lbs boost, RAF Lympne\n[2] - No. 274 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Manston\n[2] - No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron, Mustang III, RAF Brenzett\n[2] - No. 315 Polish Fighter Squadron, Mustang III, RAF Brenzett\n[2] - No. 322 Squadron RAF, Spitfire XIV, RAF West Malling\n[2] - No. 418 Squadron RCAF, Mosquito FB Mk VI, RAF Hunsdon (Essex)\n[2] - No. 486 Squadron RAF, Hawker Tempest V, RAF Newchurch\n[2] - No. 501 Squadron RAF, Tempest V, RAF Manston\n[2] - No. 605 Squadron RAF, Mosquito FB Mk VI, RAF Manston\n[2] - 746 Naval Air Squadron, Firefly Night Fighter, RAF Ford\n[2]\n\n### Deception\n\n[edit]Deception concerning the V-1 was also used against the Germans with double agents. MI5 (by way of the Double Cross System) had these agents provide Germany with damage reports for the June 1944 V-1 attacks which implied that on average the bombs were travelling too far, while not contradicting the evidence presumed to be available to German planners from photographic reconnaissance of London. The bombs had been seeded with radio-transmitting samples to confirm their range but the results from these samples were ignored in favour of the false witness accounts. Bombs were repeatedly set to fly shorter and shorter distances (and further from the intended targets) as a result of this false information.\n\n## End of operations\n\n[edit]In September 1944, Duncan Sandys announced that the \"Battle of London\" against the V-1 was effectively over, as the launch sites in France had been overrun by Allied ground forces. The Germans had prepared sites in the Netherlands, from which they launched V-1 attacks against Antwerp and Brussels starting in October 1944, against which Operation Vapour was mounted. V-2 bombardments began in September 1944, and the last enemy action of any kind on British soil in the war occurred on 29 March 1945, when a V-1 struck an empty field near Datchworth in Hertfordshire.\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]## References\n\n[edit]- King, Benjamin; Kutta, Timothy (1998).\n*IMPACT: The History of Germany's V-Weapons in World War II*.

It was a New Zealand squadron formed under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Plan. Although many of its flying personnel were largely drawn from the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the squadron served in Europe under the operational and administrative command of the Royal Air Force.\n\nFormed in March 1942 and equipped with Hawker Hurricane fighters, No. 486 Squadron became operational late the following month, initially flying patrols protecting convoys making their way through the North Sea. Although trained in a night fighting role it soon became a day fighter squadron, operating Hawker Typhoon fighters. From late 1942 to early 1943, it was tasked with intercepting incoming raids mounted by Luftwaffe fighter bombers. It was then switched to offensive operations, escorting bombers attacking targets in France and then flying in a fighter bomber role. In early 1944 the squadron re-equipped with the Hawker Tempest. In the run up to D-Day, it attacked numerous military targets in France and the Low Countries. For several weeks following D-Day, it was called upon to deal with incoming V-1 flying bombs launched at England by the Germans. It began operating from the continent in September, supporting the operations of the advancing Allied ground forces as they advanced in France, and then into Belgium, Holland and Germany itself. After the war it briefly served in Denmark and on occupation duties in Germany. It was disbanded in October 1945.\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]In the mid-1930s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was in the process of expanding and required an increasing number of suitable flying personnel. A number of schemes were implemented for New Zealanders to obtain short-service commissions in the RAF with the intention of then transferring to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) in the future. This led to over 500 New Zealanders serving in the RAF by the time of the outbreak of the Second World War.[1]\n\nAt around the same time there was discussion between the governments of Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand to facilitate the co-ordination of training of air crew in the event of hostilities. This led to the implementation of the Empire Air Training Scheme (ETAS) in December 1939. Under this agreement, New Zealand committed to initially supply 880 full trained pilots for the RAF, with another 520 pilots being trained to an elementary standard annually. As each of the Dominion governments desired its personnel to serve together, the ETAS had a clause, Article XV, that allowed for the establishment of squadrons with personnel from the respective countries. In theory, the Dominions would supply the ground crew as well as flying personnel. However, in New Zealand's case, there was a reluctance to maintain RNZAF squadrons in Britain so the decision was made to allow for the formation of squadrons within the RAF designated as being New Zealand. These squadrons, known as Article XV squadrons, were formed around a cadre of New Zealand flying personnel already serving in the RAF but supplemented by newly trained pilots from the RNZAF, with administrative and ground crew being predominantly British.[2][3]\n\n## Formation\n\n[edit]No. 486 Squadron was formed on 3 March 1942 at RAF Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, and was the second New Zealand squadron in Fighter Command.[4][Note 1] The squadron's motto, in M\u0101ori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, was *Hiwa hau Maka*, or *Beware of the Wild Winds* in English. A kea volant was selected as its badge.[6]\n\nThe squadron's first commanding officer, Squadron Leader C. L. Roberts, was British, while his two flight commanders, Flight Lieutenants John Clouston and Harvey Sweetman, along with all of the squadron's other flying personnel, were New Zealanders.[7] By the end of March, the squadron was at its full complement of 25 pilots. Allocated the code letters SA, it was initially equipped with Hawker Hurricane IIs and trained in a night fighting role. It soon moved to Wittering where it was tasked with working in conjunction with No. 1453 Flight. This involved radar-equipped but unarmed Turbinlite aircraft, Douglas A-20 Havoc medium bombers with a searchlight in the nose, locating and illuminating enemy aircraft at which point an accompanying Hurricane could make the attack. These experimental trials with No. 1453 Flight were not particularly successful and were soon abandoned.[8]\n\nThe squadron also carried out convoy patrols and its first operational flight, made on 27 April by Sweetman and Pilot Officer Arthur Umbers, was in this capacity. Sweetman was responsible for the squadron's first aerial victory, when he shot down a Dornier Do 17 medium bomber near Peterborough one night in early July.[4][6][Note 2]\n\n## Channel Front\n\n[edit]### 1942\n\n[edit]In late July, the squadron began re-equipping with Hawker Typhoons, in anticipation of switching to a role as a day fighter unit. It moved to the south of England in late August, settling first at North Weald and then West Malling, before a shift to Tangmere in October from where it would operate for over a year.[4][6]\n\nIn September, No. 486 Squadron began flying standing patrols, meant to counter incoming Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter bombers that flew at high speed, and very low altitude, to avoid being detected by radar, to make sneak attacks on targets along the coastline of England. The squadron's patrol area extended from the Isle of Wight to Shoreham, near Brighton. On 17 October the squadron achieved its first success in its new role, when two of its pilots intercepted two Fw 190s and managed to shoot one of them down into the sea. It then went several weeks without a successful interception but once low level radar stations had been established along the coast in early December, earlier detection of incoming Luftwaffe raids was possible. The squadron's interception rates improved and on 17 December, two Bf 109s were shot down. At least five more German aircraft were destroyed by the end of the year.[10]\n\n### 1943\n\n[edit]The patrols over the South coast against the Luftwaffe's raids continued into early 1943 and by April, the squadron had achieved 11\u00bd aerial victories, mostly fighter-bombers but also the odd Dornier Do 217 bomber engaged in mine laying missions.[11][12] The need for standing patrols began to decline as the effectiveness of the RAF's early detection of incoming raids increased, and instead sections of aircraft were kept on standby, ready to take off as soon as notice was received of approaching German aircraft.[13] By the middle of the year, Luftwaffe resources did not permit the ongoing sneak attacks as its focus shifted to intercepting the increasing Allied bombing raids on Germany.[14]\n\nConsequently, No. 486 Squadron switched to an offensive role, the transition in tactics was overseen by Squadron Leader Desmond Scott, who had taken command of the squadron from Roberts in April. The squadron initially flew as escorts to bombers and fighter bombers carrying out daylight bombing missions on targets in France and the Low Countries. By the middle of the year, it was itself operating in a fighter bomber role, attacking targets in Caen, Abbeville, Triqueville, Boulogne, Cherbourg and Le Havre. It also attacked shipping along the French coastline. During this time, the first Distinguished Flying Cross to be received by personnel flying with No. 486 Squadron was awarded: the recipient was Flying Officer Frank Murphy, who was credited with 4 aerial victories.[15][16]\n\nIn September, No. 486 Squadron became part of the Tangmere Typhoon Wing. The squadron was now led by Squadron Leader Ian Waddy, who had originally joined the squadron as a flight sergeant, as Scott had been promoted to wing commander and given command of the Typhoon Wing.[17] As part of the Typhoon Wing, the operations of the squadron continued mostly unchanged; it either flew in a fighter bomber role, escorted by the other two squadrons of the wing, or did escort duty itself. In some instances, the entire wing flew as fighter escort to medium or heavy bombers attacking targets in France. It also flew the occasional aerial search and rescue mission and on one of these, the rescued crew presented the squadron with the centre board of their life boat. This was subsequently used as the squadron's scoreboard.[18]\n\n## Operations against V-1 flying bombs\n\n[edit]Coinciding with the appointment of Squadron Leader John Iremonger as its commander, No. 486 Squadron began re-equipping with the new Hawker Tempest in January 1944. However, before it reached its full complement, the Tempests were subsequently transferred to No. 3 Squadron and the New Zealanders continued to operate their Typhoons.[6] At this time, it was tasked with attacking the launching sites of the new V-1 flying bombs in northern France, as well seeking out German aircraft and their airfields.[19]\n\nIn April it began receiving Tempests again and by 1 May was operational with its new aircraft.[6] At this time, the squadron became part of No. 150 Wing, along with Nos. 3 and 56 Squadrons, under the command of Wing Commander Roland Beamont.[20] Writing about the New Zealanders under his command, Beamont described them as:\n\n\"...an exuberant bunch of New Zealanders with a brilliant record on Typhoons and a rather casual approach (as I was soon to find out) to King's Regulations and Air Council instructions \u2013 and to \"Pommy Bastard\" wing leaders!\"\n\n[21]\n\nFlying with No. 150 Wing as part of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, the squadron carried out attacks on transportation infrastructure in northern France, as well as on shipping along the coastline. In the five weeks prior to the Allied invasion of Normandy, it flew 208 sorties.[22] However, when the Germans started launching V-1 flying bombs at England, beginning on the night of 12\u201313 June,[23] the squadron was tasked to deal with the threat as the Tempest was the fastest fighter plane available to the RAF. Along with No. 3 Squadron, also equipped with Tempests, it operated from Newchurch, a steel mesh field near Folkestone. Conditions were primitive, with personnel living in tents. By the end of August, No. 486 Squadron claimed 223\u00bd V-1 flying bombs as destroyed, the second highest number of any unit. The most successful of the squadron's pilots were Owen Eagleson and Raymond Cammock who both accounted at least 20 V-1s each. However, three pilots were killed during the squadron's campaign against the V-1s.[24][25]\n\n## Service with the Second Tactical Air Force\n\n[edit]In late September, with the V-1 threat over, No. 150 Wing was re-designated as No. 122 Tempest Wing,[26] and was attached to the Second Tactical Air Force. It now began operating from airfields in France as the Allied ground forces moved through Belgium and Holland, the wing provided aerial support and cover.[27] Umbers, who was a founding member of the squadron and served with it until he was posted away in September 1943, returned on 11 December to take command of his former unit. At the time, it was flying from the Volkel airfield in Holland.[28] On 25 December, two of its pilots, Jack Stafford and Duff Bremner, shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter jet. Normally the jet fighter would outpace the Tempests but Stafford and Bremner made a head-on engagement rather than attempt a chase. The Me 262 was damaged and, slowing down, was finished off by the duo and crashed near Aachen.[29]\n\nPoor weather affected operations for the first weeks of 1945 but No. 486 Squadron soon began flying well into Germany to attack transportation infrastructure and seek out targets of opportunity.[6] Umbers was killed on 14 February while attacking barges on the Dortmund-Ems Canal, near Meppen. His Tempest was hit by flak, rolled out of control into the ground and exploded.[30] He was replaced by one of the squadron's flight leaders, Keith Taylor-Cannon.[31] The squadron switched tactics in March; casualties in No. 122 Wing's operations against ground targets had been high and it was decided that the Tempests would now carry out wide-ranging sweeps, hunting out the Luftwaffe.[32]\n\nNo. 486 Squadron flew in support of the crossing of the Rhine on 23 March, dealing with anti-aircraft guns that were firing upon the Allied gliders involved in the operation.[33] From 10 April, the squadron began moving to an airfield near Hopsten, within Germany itself. It became operational from there on 12 April and the following day its commander, Taylor-Cannon, went missing. It has been speculated that, seen to have bailed out of his stricken aircraft, he was murdered by the German troops that he had been strafing. Alternative reports had Taylor-Cannon dying of wounds in hospital. Postwar investigations were unable to locate his grave.[30][34]\n\nWith Taylor-Cannon missing, Flight Lieutenant Warren Schrader took over command in an acting capacity before being promoted to squadron leader and confirmed in his appointment on 21 April.[35] However, Schrader, who had been one of the most successful fighter pilots in the preceding few weeks having destroyed a number of German aircraft during this time, was soon given command of No. 616 Squadron, the first in the RAF to be equipped with the Gloster Meteor jet fighter. He was succeeded by the squadron's final commander, Jim Sheddan, on 1 May.[36] The final sortie of the war for No. 486 Squadron was carried out a few days later, on 5 May, and involved several Tempests escorting a Douglas Dakota DC-3 to Copenhagen.[37]\n\nSoon after the war ended, No. 486 Squadron left No. 122 Wing and moved to Kastrup in Denmark. This was considered to be a \"perk job\" and the personnel of 486 were given an opportunity to unwind and relax, with each pilot being expected to log four hours of Tempest flying per month.[38] On 1 July 1945 the squadron took part in an air display and airfield open day which was attended by the Danish royal family and some 300,000 Danes. One of the attractions was the strafing and sinking of old Luftwaffe Blohm und Voss Bv 138 flying boats anchored in \u00d8resund strait.[39]\n\nNo. 486 Squadron remained in Denmark until July when it went back to Germany, stationed at L\u00fcbeck as part of No. 124 Wing, an element of the British Occupation Force.[39] It returned to the United Kingdom in September and its service ended on 12 October 1945 with the disbandment of the squadron at Dunsfold.[40][41]\n\n## Operational summary\n\n[edit]No. 486 Squadron flew over 11,000 sorties and claimed 81 enemy aircraft as destroyed, another 5 probably destroyed and 22 damaged.[42][43] Although squadron pilots claimed 241 V-1s as destroyed, RAF authorities reduced this to 223\u00bd; in spite of this the individual pilot's scores remained unaltered, as did the squadron scoreboard.[44] When operating against ground or sea targets, it was responsible for the destruction of 323 motor vehicles, 14 railway engines and 16 ships.[42][43]\n\nWhile flying Typhoons, No. 486 Squadron claimed 22\u2153 enemy aircraft as destroyed. Following the switch to Tempests, it claimed 59\u00bd enemy aircraft shot down; it was the most successful of the squadrons flying the Tempest. No. 56 Squadron was second with 59\u00bc.[11][45]\n\nPilots serving with the squadron were awarded a Distinguished Service Order, 22 Distinguished Flying Crosses and six Mentioned in Dispatches.[46]\n\n## Commanding officers\n\n[edit]The following served as commanding officers of No. 486 Squadron:[47]\n\n- Squadron Leader C. L. C. Roberts (March 1942\u2013April 1943);\n- Squadron Leader D. J. Scott (April\u2013September 1943);\n- Squadron Leader I. D. Waddy (September 1943\u2013January 1944);\n- Squadron Leader J. H. Iremonger (January\u2013December 1944);\n- Squadron Leader A. E. Umbers\n**\u2020**(December 1944\u2013February 1945); - Squadron Leader K. G. Taylor-Cannon\n**\u2020**(February\u2013April 1945); - Squadron Leader W. E. Schrader (April\u2013May 1945);\n- Squadron Leader C. J. Sheddan (May\u2013October 1945).\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]A Hawker Tempest Mk.V, *EJ693*, was used by the squadron with the codes SA-I from September to October 1944. It was damaged in a forced landing on 1 October and was subsequently used by No. 151 Repair Unit as a test airframe for repaired engines. It is being restored by Kermit Weeks in Florida.[48]\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]### Footnotes\n\n[edit]### Citations\n\n[edit]**^**McGibbon 2000, p. 8.**^**McGibbon 2000, pp. 156\u2013157.**^**Thompson 1953, pp. 209\u2013211.- ^\n**a****b**Thompson 1953, pp. 335\u2013336.**c** **^**Rawlings 1976, p. 449.- ^\n**a****b****c****d****e**Rawlings 1976, pp. 451\u2013452.**f** **^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 5.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 14\u201316.**^**Mitchell 1945, p. 162.**^**Thompson 1953, pp. 355\u2013358.- ^\n**a**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 339\u2013340.**b** **^**Mitchell 1945, p. 164.**^**Thompson 1956, pp. 200\u2013201.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 199.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 203.**^**Mitchell 1945, pp. 165\u2013166.**^**Mitchell 1945, pp. 167\u2013168.**^**Thompson 1956, pp. 206\u2013207.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 265.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 145.**^**Beamont 1992, p. 21.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 266.**^**Lambert 2011, p. 324.**^**Lambert 2011, pp. 327\u2013330.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 193.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 177.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 333.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 190.**^**Lambert 2011, p. 353.- ^\n**a**Lambert 2014, pp. 193\u2013194.**b** **^**Lambert 2011, p. 352.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 229.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 229\u2013230.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 242.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 254.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 266\u2013268.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 275.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 281\u2013283.- ^\n**a**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 289\u2013290.**b** **^**Thompson 1956, pp. 458\u2013459.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 295\u2013296.- ^\n**a**Thompson 1956, p. 459.**b** - ^\n**a**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 338\u2013352.**b** **^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 172\u2013173.**^**Thomas & Shores 1988, p. 193.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 336.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 337.**^**\"Hawker Tempest Mk.

It was a New Zealand squadron formed under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Plan. Although many of its flying personnel were largely drawn from the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the squadron served in Europe under the operational and administrative command of the Royal Air Force.\n\nFormed in March 1942 and equipped with Hawker Hurricane fighters, No. 486 Squadron became operational late the following month, initially flying patrols protecting convoys making their way through the North Sea. Although trained in a night fighting role it soon became a day fighter squadron, operating Hawker Typhoon fighters. From late 1942 to early 1943, it was tasked with intercepting incoming raids mounted by Luftwaffe fighter bombers. It was then switched to offensive operations, escorting bombers attacking targets in France and then flying in a fighter bomber role. In early 1944 the squadron re-equipped with the Hawker Tempest. In the run up to D-Day, it attacked numerous military targets in France and the Low Countries. For several weeks following D-Day, it was called upon to deal with incoming V-1 flying bombs launched at England by the Germans. It began operating from the continent in September, supporting the operations of the advancing Allied ground forces as they advanced in France, and then into Belgium, Holland and Germany itself. After the war it briefly served in Denmark and on occupation duties in Germany. It was disbanded in October 1945.\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]In the mid-1930s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was in the process of expanding and required an increasing number of suitable flying personnel. A number of schemes were implemented for New Zealanders to obtain short-service commissions in the RAF with the intention of then transferring to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) in the future. This led to over 500 New Zealanders serving in the RAF by the time of the outbreak of the Second World War.[1]\n\nAt around the same time there was discussion between the governments of Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand to facilitate the co-ordination of training of air crew in the event of hostilities. This led to the implementation of the Empire Air Training Scheme (ETAS) in December 1939. Under this agreement, New Zealand committed to initially supply 880 full trained pilots for the RAF, with another 520 pilots being trained to an elementary standard annually. As each of the Dominion governments desired its personnel to serve together, the ETAS had a clause, Article XV, that allowed for the establishment of squadrons with personnel from the respective countries. In theory, the Dominions would supply the ground crew as well as flying personnel. However, in New Zealand's case, there was a reluctance to maintain RNZAF squadrons in Britain so the decision was made to allow for the formation of squadrons within the RAF designated as being New Zealand. These squadrons, known as Article XV squadrons, were formed around a cadre of New Zealand flying personnel already serving in the RAF but supplemented by newly trained pilots from the RNZAF, with administrative and ground crew being predominantly British.[2][3]\n\n## Formation\n\n[edit]No. 486 Squadron was formed on 3 March 1942 at RAF Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, and was the second New Zealand squadron in Fighter Command.[4][Note 1] The squadron's motto, in M\u0101ori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, was *Hiwa hau Maka*, or *Beware of the Wild Winds* in English. A kea volant was selected as its badge.[6]\n\nThe squadron's first commanding officer, Squadron Leader C. L. Roberts, was British, while his two flight commanders, Flight Lieutenants John Clouston and Harvey Sweetman, along with all of the squadron's other flying personnel, were New Zealanders.[7] By the end of March, the squadron was at its full complement of 25 pilots. Allocated the code letters SA, it was initially equipped with Hawker Hurricane IIs and trained in a night fighting role. It soon moved to Wittering where it was tasked with working in conjunction with No. 1453 Flight. This involved radar-equipped but unarmed Turbinlite aircraft, Douglas A-20 Havoc medium bombers with a searchlight in the nose, locating and illuminating enemy aircraft at which point an accompanying Hurricane could make the attack. These experimental trials with No. 1453 Flight were not particularly successful and were soon abandoned.[8]\n\nThe squadron also carried out convoy patrols and its first operational flight, made on 27 April by Sweetman and Pilot Officer Arthur Umbers, was in this capacity. Sweetman was responsible for the squadron's first aerial victory, when he shot down a Dornier Do 17 medium bomber near Peterborough one night in early July.[4][6][Note 2]\n\n## Channel Front\n\n[edit]### 1942\n\n[edit]In late July, the squadron began re-equipping with Hawker Typhoons, in anticipation of switching to a role as a day fighter unit. It moved to the south of England in late August, settling first at North Weald and then West Malling, before a shift to Tangmere in October from where it would operate for over a year.[4][6]\n\nIn September, No. 486 Squadron began flying standing patrols, meant to counter incoming Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter bombers that flew at high speed, and very low altitude, to avoid being detected by radar, to make sneak attacks on targets along the coastline of England. The squadron's patrol area extended from the Isle of Wight to Shoreham, near Brighton. On 17 October the squadron achieved its first success in its new role, when two of its pilots intercepted two Fw 190s and managed to shoot one of them down into the sea. It then went several weeks without a successful interception but once low level radar stations had been established along the coast in early December, earlier detection of incoming Luftwaffe raids was possible. The squadron's interception rates improved and on 17 December, two Bf 109s were shot down. At least five more German aircraft were destroyed by the end of the year.[10]\n\n### 1943\n\n[edit]The patrols over the South coast against the Luftwaffe's raids continued into early 1943 and by April, the squadron had achieved 11\u00bd aerial victories, mostly fighter-bombers but also the odd Dornier Do 217 bomber engaged in mine laying missions.[11][12] The need for standing patrols began to decline as the effectiveness of the RAF's early detection of incoming raids increased, and instead sections of aircraft were kept on standby, ready to take off as soon as notice was received of approaching German aircraft.[13] By the middle of the year, Luftwaffe resources did not permit the ongoing sneak attacks as its focus shifted to intercepting the increasing Allied bombing raids on Germany.[14]\n\nConsequently, No. 486 Squadron switched to an offensive role, the transition in tactics was overseen by Squadron Leader Desmond Scott, who had taken command of the squadron from Roberts in April. The squadron initially flew as escorts to bombers and fighter bombers carrying out daylight bombing missions on targets in France and the Low Countries. By the middle of the year, it was itself operating in a fighter bomber role, attacking targets in Caen, Abbeville, Triqueville, Boulogne, Cherbourg and Le Havre. It also attacked shipping along the French coastline. During this time, the first Distinguished Flying Cross to be received by personnel flying with No. 486 Squadron was awarded: the recipient was Flying Officer Frank Murphy, who was credited with 4 aerial victories.[15][16]\n\nIn September, No. 486 Squadron became part of the Tangmere Typhoon Wing. The squadron was now led by Squadron Leader Ian Waddy, who had originally joined the squadron as a flight sergeant, as Scott had been promoted to wing commander and given command of the Typhoon Wing.[17] As part of the Typhoon Wing, the operations of the squadron continued mostly unchanged; it either flew in a fighter bomber role, escorted by the other two squadrons of the wing, or did escort duty itself. In some instances, the entire wing flew as fighter escort to medium or heavy bombers attacking targets in France. It also flew the occasional aerial search and rescue mission and on one of these, the rescued crew presented the squadron with the centre board of their life boat. This was subsequently used as the squadron's scoreboard.[18]\n\n## Operations against V-1 flying bombs\n\n[edit]Coinciding with the appointment of Squadron Leader John Iremonger as its commander, No. 486 Squadron began re-equipping with the new Hawker Tempest in January 1944.

One of the attractions was the strafing and sinking of old Luftwaffe Blohm und Voss Bv 138 flying boats anchored in \u00d8resund strait.[39]\n\nNo. 486 Squadron remained in Denmark until July when it went back to Germany, stationed at L\u00fcbeck as part of No. 124 Wing, an element of the British Occupation Force.[39] It returned to the United Kingdom in September and its service ended on 12 October 1945 with the disbandment of the squadron at Dunsfold.[40][41]\n\n## Operational summary\n\n[edit]No. 486 Squadron flew over 11,000 sorties and claimed 81 enemy aircraft as destroyed, another 5 probably destroyed and 22 damaged.[42][43] Although squadron pilots claimed 241 V-1s as destroyed, RAF authorities reduced this to 223\u00bd; in spite of this the individual pilot's scores remained unaltered, as did the squadron scoreboard.[44] When operating against ground or sea targets, it was responsible for the destruction of 323 motor vehicles, 14 railway engines and 16 ships.[42][43]\n\nWhile flying Typhoons, No. 486 Squadron claimed 22\u2153 enemy aircraft as destroyed. Following the switch to Tempests, it claimed 59\u00bd enemy aircraft shot down; it was the most successful of the squadrons flying the Tempest. No. 56 Squadron was second with 59\u00bc.[11][45]\n\nPilots serving with the squadron were awarded a Distinguished Service Order, 22 Distinguished Flying Crosses and six Mentioned in Dispatches.[46]\n\n## Commanding officers\n\n[edit]The following served as commanding officers of No. 486 Squadron:[47]\n\n- Squadron Leader C. L. C. Roberts (March 1942\u2013April 1943);\n- Squadron Leader D. J. Scott (April\u2013September 1943);\n- Squadron Leader I. D. Waddy (September 1943\u2013January 1944);\n- Squadron Leader J. H. Iremonger (January\u2013December 1944);\n- Squadron Leader A. E. Umbers\n**\u2020**(December 1944\u2013February 1945); - Squadron Leader K. G. Taylor-Cannon\n**\u2020**(February\u2013April 1945); - Squadron Leader W. E. Schrader (April\u2013May 1945);\n- Squadron Leader C. J. Sheddan (May\u2013October 1945).\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]A Hawker Tempest Mk.V, *EJ693*, was used by the squadron with the codes SA-I from September to October 1944. It was damaged in a forced landing on 1 October and was subsequently used by No. 151 Repair Unit as a test airframe for repaired engines. It is being restored by Kermit Weeks in Florida.[48]\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]### Footnotes\n\n[edit]### Citations\n\n[edit]**^**McGibbon 2000, p. 8.**^**McGibbon 2000, pp. 156\u2013157.**^**Thompson 1953, pp. 209\u2013211.- ^\n**a****b**Thompson 1953, pp. 335\u2013336.**c** **^**Rawlings 1976, p. 449.- ^\n**a****b****c****d****e**Rawlings 1976, pp. 451\u2013452.**f** **^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 5.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 14\u201316.**^**Mitchell 1945, p. 162.**^**Thompson 1953, pp. 355\u2013358.- ^\n**a**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 339\u2013340.**b** **^**Mitchell 1945, p. 164.**^**Thompson 1956, pp. 200\u2013201.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 199.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 203.**^**Mitchell 1945, pp. 165\u2013166.**^**Mitchell 1945, pp. 167\u2013168.**^**Thompson 1956, pp. 206\u2013207.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 265.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 145.**^**Beamont 1992, p. 21.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 266.**^**Lambert 2011, p. 324.**^**Lambert 2011, pp. 327\u2013330.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 193.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 177.**^**Thompson 1956, p. 333.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 190.**^**Lambert 2011, p. 353.- ^\n**a**Lambert 2014, pp. 193\u2013194.**b** **^**Lambert 2011, p. 352.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 229.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 229\u2013230.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 242.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 254.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 266\u2013268.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 275.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 281\u2013283.- ^\n**a**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 289\u2013290.**b** **^**Thompson 1956, pp. 458\u2013459.**^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 295\u2013296.- ^\n**a**Thompson 1956, p. 459.**b** - ^\n**a**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 338\u2013352.**b** **^**Sortehaug 1998, pp. 172\u2013173.**^**Thomas & Shores 1988, p. 193.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 336.**^**Sortehaug 1998, p. 337.**^**\"Hawker Tempest Mk.

This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city. One particularly effective propeller-driven fighter aircraft in this defense was subsequently operated by several air forces, including its originating nation's. Within this nation's air arm, a specific numerically designated squadron, which had earlier flown other aircraft types against targets such as projectile launch sites, was eventually equipped with this effective fighter.

As shown in Figure 4, SMP recovery is the process in which a shape, once fixed below Tg, returns to its original form when it is above Tg. Above Tg, the polymer chain releases stored strain energy, as a result of the entropy change-induced elasticity.\nQ: What is the thermal shape memory effect?\nA: The shape memory effect is the result of a phase transition. The phase transition occurs during a heating process at a certain temperature. Forced by mechanical work, which follows the phase transition, the shape memory alloy or the shape memory polymer reverts to a previously held shape.","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_J2sbg6KI7sqkwGE33pAiv0mN\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Functional Fatigue of Shape-Memory Polymers\\\\\\\" MRS 2009 'functional fatigue' 'shape-memory polymers' 2009 MRS Proceedings authors 'Frenzel'\\\",\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: Functional Fatigue of Shape Memory Polymers\nURL: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/230068370_Functional_Fatigue_of_Shape_Memory_Polymers\nFunctional fatigue is the degradation of shape memory effect upon thermal or thermomechanical cycling, appearing as the decrease in the ability ...Read more\n\n---\n\nPeople Also Ask:\nQ: What is the shape memory effect in polymers?\nQ: What is polymer fatigue?\nQ: What is the fatigue of shape memory alloys?","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_kQ3Lksdc4yDv6TWGQ3g2jFel\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"urls\\\":[\\\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/230068370_Functional_Fatigue_of_Shape_Memory_Polymers\\\"]}\", \"name\": \"open\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"# Open Result 0\nError fetching https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/230068370_Functional_Fatigue_of_Shape_Memory_Polymers: 403, message='Forbidden', url='https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/230068370_Functional_Fatigue_of_Shape_Memory_Polymers'","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_A0UIQxhancADn5hzdwD8i3Ft\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\":\\\"MRS Proceedings Volume 1190 2009 Table of Contents 'Shape-Memory Polymers' 'Proceedings, San Francisco, CA, 2009, vol. 1190' 'MRS Proceedings 1190 abstracts'\\\" ,\\\"num_results\\\":10}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"Result 0: [PDF] Experimental Characterization of Shape-Memory Polymers\nURL: https:\/\/www.tesisenred.net\/bitstream\/handle\/10803\/386552\/TESI.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\nShape-Memory Polymers, in Materials Research Society Symposium.

This includes\ninteractions with molecules, biological systems, and physical stimuli. Research\nin active polymers has been driven by the increasing demand for  intelligent\nmaterials, especially in biomedical and aerospace applications. Tremendous\nprogress in synthesis, analytics, and molecular modeling enables scientists\ntoday to develop active polymer systems in a knowledge-based  approach.\n\nBiological systems might serve as blue prints for biomimetic and bionic\nsolutions. Interdisciplinary approaches combining the expertise of chemists,\nphysicists, biologists, pharmacologists, and materials engineers lead to\ninnovative material concepts, e.g., enabling morphing  structures or \"living\"\ntextiles. Emerging active polymers respond to a range of stimuli from changes\nin pH and temperature to light and magnetic fields. Interactive behavior can\nalso be stimulated by small bioactive molecules or influences  of complex\nbiological systems. Remote and on-demand control is envisioned, and model\nsystems have been developed.\n\nSymposium NN, \"Active Polymers,\" held April  14-17 at the 2009 MRS\n\nSpring Meeting in San Francisco, California,  was the first MRS  symposium\nfocused  on active polymers. A highly interdisciplinary  scientific  community\nused this great opportunity to gather and discuss the topics: shape-memory\npolymers; shape-changing polymers; responsive hydrogels;  stimuli-sensitive\nsystems; intelligent polymers in biological systems; polymer-based  actuators,\nsensors, and switches; active surfaces; and biomedical applications of active\nmaterials, especially for tissue regeneration and controlled drug release.\nSymposium NN \"Active Polymers\" far exceeded our expectations in\nparticipation, diversity of topics, and duration, with 60 oral presentations\nand 43 posters spanning twelve sessions.\n\nNotable presentations included shape-memory  nanocomposites\nby Richard A. Vaia, and color-changing shape-memory polymers by\nPatrick T. Mather. Duncan Maitland reported on design and realization\nof biomedical devices based on shape-memory polymers. The application\nof shape-memory polymers as space deployables and novel actuators was\npresented by Steven C. Arzberger. Rein V. Ulijn presented about exploiting\nenzymes in responsive materials and  nanofabrications.\n\nXI\n\nwww.cambridge.org\u00a9 in this web service Cambridge University PressCambridge University Press978-1-107-40816-6 - Active Polymers: Materials Research Society SymposiumProceedings: Volume 1190Editors: Andreas Lendlein, V.

This particular work, published in 2009 and co-authored by a researcher also involved in the aforementioned NiTi and superalloy studies, shifted focus from metallic alloys. It investigated the repeated programming and recovery cycles of a different class of 'smart' material \u2013 specifically, an amorphous commercial polymer. The study examined how the 'memory' effect changes and how much permanent deformation accumulates over multiple cycles.

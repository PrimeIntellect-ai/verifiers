This contributor often works between an institution symbolizing Sino-Japanese cooperation and a prominent capital university specializing in traditional medicine, though for this specific lung-focused paper published mid-decade, the collaborators hailed exclusively from the latter institution.","role":"user","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_1LjiINxdbUdwvaeIiquG5GIh\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Step 1: Explore the data\\\\nprint(type(extra_data))\\\\nprint(extra_data[:500] if isinstance(extra_data, str) else extra_data[:3])\\\"}\", \"name\": \"call_python_repl\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}"]},{"content":"<class 'NoneType'>\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\/tmp\/rlm_worker.py\", line 186, in <module>\n    value = eval(\n            ^^^^^\n  File \"<cell>\", line 3, in <module>\nTypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable\n[Execution time: 0.19s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_jvVPAseXF1LY2LGFvDHSY6yQ\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"# Step 2: Use llm_batch to search for the described paper.\\\\nprompts = [\\\\n    \\\\\\\"You are a scholarly search assistant.

It appears papers that combine (network pharmacology\/bioinformatics) + (senior TCM practitioner perspectives) on lung cancer and that include Beijing University of Chinese Medicine authors are rare in 2014; similar work became more common in later years (2015\u20132018).\n2. If you want, I can (a) expand the year range (e.g., 2012\u20132018) to locate such studies, (b) search CNKI\/GVIP directly for full author affiliation lists, or (c) fetch full texts of the closest hits to confirm author affiliations and whether senior practitioner commentary is included.

This work ventured beyond one dimension, analyzing how quantum probability distributions spread across a plane.\n\nThe study focused on the 'feasible region' and its limiting shape, surprisingly linking it to algebraic geometry. The methods employed relied heavily on analyzing generating functions, echoing approaches refined by a well-regarded probability expert at an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, known for his work in combinatorics and recognized by multiple fellowships (including one bearing the name of a notable mathematician and hedge fund founder).\n\nOne key author on this paper, then affiliated with a major industrial research laboratory in New Jersey famed for its foundational contributions to communications technology, had previously published on diverse topics: applying topological invariants like the Euler characteristic to sensor network problems, comparing congestion patterns in hyperbolic versus Euclidean network models, and exploring geometric relationships involving simplices and Gaussian samples during his earlier research period in Germany.

These are the most promising leads from 1978\u20131985 for contexts where authors commonly used simplified\/single\u2011region or surrogate representations (i.e., what later literature calls \"substitute models\") in inverse problems. However, explicit occurrences of the exact English phrase \"substitute models\" in journal papers from 1978\u20131985 were rare in the general web search results I accessed.\n- For a deeper, more exhaustive harvest of exact\u2011phrase matches in 1978\u20131985 I recommend targeted searches in: INIS (IAEA) database, OSTI.gov, GEOREF, Web of Science, and the archives of Geophysics \/ Journal of Geophysical Research \/ Journal of Contaminant Hydrology \/ Atomnaya Energiya (for Russian literature).

I could not exhaustively search bibliographic databases within the tool-call limit, so items below are the best matches located by text\/PDF hits; I supply the bibliographic item (as shown on the page) and a URL\/short note enabling direct inspection of the phrase\/context.\n\n1) Analysis of equivalence for the Schlumberger resistivity methods.

(Manuscript received May 25, 1983 \u2014 journal publication 1984.)\n\n2) (Referenced method from ~1980) Topographic modelling in electrical imaging inversion (abstract \/ technical note). M. H. Loke (abstract\/pdf).  \n   - URL \/ abstract: http:\/\/www.geotomosoft.com\/topoabs.pdf  \n   - Why relevant: this short note \/ abstract explicitly uses wording such as \u201cto transform a model with topography into an equivalent model with a flat surface\u201d \u2014 i.e., using an equivalent model as a substitute to simplify the inverse forward-model geometry; it cites a 1980 transform and therefore points to equivalent-model usage around 1980.\n\n3) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory technical document (contains quotations and historical references to \u201cequivalent model\u201d usage in inverse problems; cites works from 1978\u20131985).  \n   - URL \/ PDF: https:\/\/escholarship.org\/content\/qt330734mg\/qt330734mg.pdf  \n   - Why relevant: the LBNL document quotes the phrase \u201cIt is an equivalent model because it replaces \u2026\u201d and lists earlier work (years 1978, 1981, 1984a, 1984b, 1985) in the context of inverse-model substitutions \u2014 useful as a pointer to original 1978\u20131985 primary papers.\n\nNotes and recommended next steps:\n- The explicit phrase \u201cequivalent model(s)\u201d does appear in the geophysics literature in the early\u2013mid 1980s, but direct exact-phrase hits in 1978\u20131985 are relatively sparse in the open-web snippets returned. The GeoScienceWorld 1984 Geophysics article (item 1) is the clearest journal match in the requested window.  \n- To produce a more exhaustive, authoritative bibliography (complete author lists, page ranges, exact phrase locations in text), I recommend (a) searching GeoRef \/ Web of Science \/ Scopus and the SEG\/Geophysics and Journal of Geophysical Research archives for the exact phrase limited to 1978\u20131985, and (b) opening the PDFs of candidate items (the GeoScienceWorld PDF above is immediately inspectable and contains the phrase).  \n- If you want, I can (with permission to make more tool calls) run targeted queries against GeoRef\/Google Scholar\/WorldCat\/SEG archives to extract full bibliographic records (authors, exact pages where \u201cequivalent model(s)\u201d appears) for all 1978\u20131985 matches.\n\n\n--- Prompt 3 ---\nNo definitive Soviet\u2013English coauthored borehole-logging\/nuclear-geophysics paper (early 1980s) matching \u201cMoscow Academy of Sciences author + coauthor later at GRI\/GTI (Illinois)\u201d was found within the search limits. Best candidate sources to extract exact paper titles and author names are: (1) the CIA translation \u201cOptimization of Probe Device for Selective \u03b3-\u03b3 Borehole Logging\u201d (1980), (2) USGS well-log bibliographies (1985, 1995), and (3) early-1980s Soviet mining\/geophysics conference proceedings. Recommended next step: I can run targeted searches of those sources (and GRI\/GTI report indexes or Scopus\/Web of Science) to pull the exact author names and confirm any person who later worked at GRI\/GTI.\n[Execution time: 94.94s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_j1BppVboB7Tr3k6zWqhTL9de\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"prompts = [\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Search the Atomnaya Energiya (elib.biblioatom.ru) site for articles between 1978 and 1985 containing the Russian words '\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0442\\u043d\\u0430\\u044f \\u0437\\u0430\\u0434\\u0430\\u0447\\u0430', '\\u0438\\u043d\\u0432\\u0435\\u0440\\u0441\\u0438', '\\u0438\\u043d\\u0442\\u0435\\u0440\\u043f\\u0440\\u0435\\u0442', '\\u0437\\u0430\\u043c\\u0435\\u0449\\u0430', or '\\u044d\\u043a\\u0432\\u0438\\u0432\\u0430\\u043b\\u0435\\u043d\\u0442\\u043d' (to catch '\\u0437\\u0430\\u043c\\u0435\\u0449\\u0430\\u044e\\u0449\\u0438\\u0435 \\u043c\\u043e\\u0434\\u0435\\u043b\\u0438' \/ 'equivalent models').

Polyachenko later worked at the U.S. Gas Technology Institute (formerly Gas Research Institute, Illinois) or at another U.S.\/Illinois gas\u2011technology research organization.\n  \u2022 Vestnik article (affiliation shown): https:\/\/vestnik-ngo.kz\/2707-4226\/article\/view\/108782\n\n- K. I. Yakubson (Yakubson K.I.): Available literature cites K.I. Yakubson as a Soviet-era researcher in neutron\/gamma spectrometry and activation analysis (papers and bibliographic listings from the 1960s\u20131980s). Examples: USGS bibliography and bibliographic indexes list Yakubson K.I. as an author of Soviet works on neutron activation \/ gamma spectrometry. I found no documentation that K.I. Yakubson later worked at the U.S. Gas Technology Institute (Gas Research Institute) or at a comparable U.S.\/Illinois gas\u2011technology research institution.\n  \u2022 USGS bibliographic citation (lists Yakubson references): https:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/1980\/0503\/report.pdf\n  \u2022 Activation analysis bibliographic index (archive listing mentioning Yakubson): https:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/activationanalys467lutz\/activationanalys467lutz_djvu.txt\n  \u2022 INIS\/IAEA bibliographic record examples referencing Yakubson: https:\/\/inis.iaea.org\/records\/156dp-x6687\/files\/5148160.pdf?download=1\n\nConclusion: Based on the sources located, neither A.L. Polyachenko nor K.I. Yakubson is documented as having a later affiliation with the Gas Technology Institute (Gas Research Institute) in Illinois or with a similar U.S.\/Illinois gas\u2011technology research institution. The documented later affiliation for Polyachenko is with a Russian\/Kazakh Oil & Gas Technology Institute (Geo\u2011Spectrum); Yakubson\u2019s publications appear to be Soviet\/Russian and bibliographic, with no confirmed U.S. gas\u2011technology institute affiliation.\n[Execution time: 108.64s]","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_L4AIEiZJCyKTjrGZxrX0FGPg\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"code\\\":\\\"prompts = [\\\\n    \\\\\\\"Give a short bio for A.

This vessel deployed airborne devices, essentially buoyant craft with destructive payloads. Decades later, during a major global conflict, a British initiative massively employed similar aerial devices against a continental foe. This initiative, notable for its reliance on atmospheric currents, later saw its supply chain diverted to support a defensive operation against new unmanned aerial threats. This defensive operation, named in direct reference to the threat it countered, utilized various means, including interceptor aircraft, to defend a capital city.

Typical ranges cited in HVDC handbooks and tutorial material are roughly 100 kV to 500 kV for monopoles in many installations; modern HVDC technology and bipole systems use higher voltages (up to 600\u2013800 kV for large projects).

Electrode resistance of purposely designed HVDC electrodes is typically small but non\u2011zero (order 0.1 \u03a9 to a few ohms for large buried ring or radial electrodes; in poorer soils it can be larger). With practical monopole currents (hundreds to a few thousand amperes), electrode potentials relative to remote earth are therefore typically in the range of hundreds to a few thousand volts (i.e., 10^2\u201310^4 V), not hundreds of kilovolts. Example ranges and implications:\\n  - Typical electrode resistances R_e reported in CIGRE\/EPRI guidance: roughly 0.1 \u03a9 \u2013 several \u03a9 depending on siting\/design. (CIGRE TB 675; EPRI HVDC Ground Electrode Overview).\\n  - Typical monopole currents I on practical links: a few hundred A up to ~2000 A (depends on power rating and pole voltage). For I = 500\u20132000 A and R_e = 0.2\u20133 \u03a9, V_e = I\u00b7R_e \u2248 100 V \u2013 6 000 V (order: hundreds to a few thousand volts). In many well\u2011designed electrodes the steady electrode potential is held to the low hundreds to low thousands of volts. Sea return electrodes (seawater) usually produce much lower electrode potentials because seawater bulk resistance is far lower. \\n  - References: CIGRE \u201cGeneral guidelines for HVDC electrode design\u201d (TB 675) (gives electrode resistance examples, potential distribution and design guidance); EPRI \u201cHVDC Ground Electrode Overview\u201d (discusses electrode design, resistances and typical potentials); survey papers on ground\/sea return electrode systems.\\n\\n3) Practical guidance \/ quoted statements in the literature\\n- CIGRE TB 675 (General guidelines for HVDC electrode design) \u2014 discusses electrode resistance, formulae for potential distribution, and electrode potentials (gives design ranges and worked examples showing electrode potentials of the order of 10^2\u201310^4 V for typical currents and resistances).

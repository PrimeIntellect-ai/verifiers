His speed relative to the water is 20 km\/h perpendicular to the bank, but the current in the river is along the bank (x-direction), affecting his motion.\n- Both start simultaneously at time t = 0.\n- The sound signals from both sirens reach Gavrila simultaneously at some point during the experiment.\n\nThe speeds are converted to consistent units: 20 km\/h = 50\/9 m\/s. Thus, both Glafira and Gavrila have y-components of velocity equal to 50\/9 m\/s relative to the water. However, Gavrila's motion is affected by the current along the x-axis, denoted as u(y), which may depend on the distance from the bank (y).\n\nThe condition that sound signals reach Gavrila simultaneously is interpreted as follows: at the time when Gavrila is 40 meters from the bank (y = 40 m), the distances from his position to the positions of the sirens at that same time are equal. This ensures that if signals are emitted at that instant, they will arrive at Gavrila at the same time, assuming sound speed is constant and motion during flight is negligible.\n\nAt time t, the position of the first siren is fixed at (-100, 0). The position of the second siren, moving with Glafira, is (0, v_g t), where v_g = 50\/9 m\/s. Gavrila's position at time t is (x_g(t), y_g(t)).\n\nGiven that y_g(t) = 40 m, and since Gavrila's y-velocity is constant at v_m = 50\/9 m\/s (as the current does not affect y-motion), the time t when y = 40 m is:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{40}{v_m} = \\frac{40}{50\/9} = 40 \\times \\frac{9}{50} = \\frac{360}{50} = 7.2 \\text{ seconds}.\n\\]\n\nAt this time, the distance from Gavrila to the first siren equals the distance to the second siren:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x_g + 100)^2 + (40 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(x_g - 0)^2 + (40 - v_g \\cdot 7.2)^2}\n\\]\nSince v_g = v_m = 50\/9 m\/s:\n\\[\nv_g \\cdot 7.2 = \\frac{50}{9} \\times 7.2 = \\frac{50}{9} \\times \\frac{72}{10} = \\frac{50 \\times 72}{9 \\times 10} = \\frac{50 \\times 8}{10} = 40 \\text{ meters}.\n\\]\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x_g + 100)^2 + 40^2} = \\sqrt{x_g^2 + (40 - 40)^2} = \\sqrt{x_g^2}\n\\]\nSince distance is positive, \\sqrt{x_g^2} = |x_g|, but solving the equality:\n\\[\n(x_g + 100)^2 + 1600 = x_g^2\n\\]\nExpanding:\n\\[\nx_g^2 + 200x_g + 10000 + 1600 = x_g^2\n\\]\n\\[\n200x_g + 11600 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n200x_g = -11600\n\\]\n\\[\nx_g = \\frac{-11600}{200} = -58 \\text{ meters}.\n\\]\n\nGavrila's position when y = 40 m is (-58, 40).

This is determined by considering the worst-case placement of the 8 ships and finding the smallest number of row or column shots such that, regardless of the placement, at least one ship is hit.\n\nEach shot covers all cells in one row or one column. A ship is hit if it occupies at least one cell in a shot row or shot column. To avoid being hit, a ship must be entirely contained within the subgrid of non-shot rows and non-shot columns, referred to as the safe subgrid. The size of the safe subgrid is \\(m \\times n\\), where \\(m = 8 - r\\) and \\(n = 8 - c\\), with \\(r\\) being the number of shot rows and \\(c\\) the number of shot columns. The maximum number of ships that can be placed in an \\(m \\times n\\) grid without overlapping is denoted \\(f(m, n)\\).\n\nThe goal is to choose \\(r\\) and \\(c\\) such that \\(f(m, n) \\leq 7\\), ensuring that at most 7 ships can be placed without being hit. Since 8 ships are placed, at least one must be hit. The total number of shots is \\(k = r + c\\), and the aim is to minimize \\(k\\).\n\nCalculations show that for \\(k = 5\\), any combination of \\(r\\) and \\(c\\) with \\(r + c = 5\\) results in a safe subgrid where \\(f(m, n) \\geq 8\\).

This is shown by considering two cases:\n- If there is a number in \\([0.5, 1]\\), use that number as one subset (sum \\(\\leq 1\\)) and the remaining numbers as the other subset (sum \\(\\leq 5\\) since \\(5.5 - 1 = 4.5 \\leq 5\\)).\n- If all numbers are less than \\(0.5\\), there exists a subset summing to a value in \\([0.5, 1)\\) (by adding numbers in decreasing order until the sum is at least \\(0.5\\); since each number is less than \\(0.5\\), the sum is less than \\(1\\)). Use this subset as one subset (sum \\(\\leq 1\\)) and the remaining numbers as the other subset (sum \\(\\leq 5\\) since \\(5.5 - 1 = 4.5 \\leq 5\\)).\n\nFor any \\(S > \\frac{11}{2}\\), there exists a multiset summing to \\(S\\) that cannot be partitioned as required.

Each vertex would need to have exactly 1 vertex at each distance, which is impossible because an odd number of vertices cannot form a regular graph of degree 1 (matching). Thus, \\( n = 1 \\) is impossible.\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\): The total number of vertices is \\( 1 + 2 \\times 2018 = 4037 \\). A cycle graph (Moore graph of diameter 2018) with 4037 vertices satisfies the condition. Each vertex has exactly 2 vertices at each distance from 1 to 2018. This configuration works.\n\n3. **General Case Analysis**:\n   - For larger \\( n \\), constructing such a graph becomes complex. The problem requires a distance-regular graph where each distance layer has exactly \\( n \\) vertices. The intersection array parameters must be carefully considered.\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\), the cycle graph works for any diameter \\( D \\). For other values of \\( n \\), the graph's feasibility depends on satisfying distance-regular conditions and Krein conditions, which are non-trivial for large \\( D \\) like 2018.\n\n4. **Constraints and Feasibility**:\n   - The intersection array and Krein conditions must be satisfied. For large \\( D \\), the only feasible solution found is \\( n = 2 \\), as other values lead to contradictions or fail Krein conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only feasible solution that satisfies all conditions for the given problem with \\( D = 2018 \\) is \\( n = 2 \\). This is achieved by a cycle graph of length \\( 2 \\times 2018 + 1 = 4037 \\), ensuring each vertex has exactly 2 vertices at each distance from 1 to 2018.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{2}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":0.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":745394.7489261627,"scoring_ms":2.3989677429,"total_ms":745397.1478939056,"answer":" 2 \\\\mid n ","correct_answer_rlm":0.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":1.0,"prompt_tokens":989.0,"completion_tokens":21887.0,"total_tool_calls":0.0}

The key observation is that for each player, the 12th list contains names not present in the 11th list. This implies that the victory graph must be such that every player can reach every other player through a path of victories, but requires the maximum path length to be exactly 11 (so the 12th list finally includes all players). \n\nIn graph theory, a tournament is a directed graph where every pair of vertices is connected by a single directed edge (no draws). A strongly connected tournament guarantees a path between any two players. If the tournament is structured such that for every player, there exists another player at the maximum possible distance of 11, the condition holds. This scenario is possible **only if there are no draws** (i.e., every game has a winner and a loser).

A circle centered at point \\(E\\) passes through the midpoints of the sides of \\(ABC\\), and \\(B\\), \\(T\\), \\(E\\) are collinear. The goal is to find \\(\\angle ABC\\).\n\nGiven \\(\\angle ATB = 120^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle BTC = 120^\\circ\\), and since \\(T\\) is inside the acute-angled triangle, the angles around \\(T\\) sum to \\(360^\\circ\\). Thus, \\(\\angle ATC = 360^\\circ - 120^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 120^\\circ\\). Therefore, \\(T\\) is the Fermat-Torricelli point of \\(\\triangle ABC\\), where each angle subtended at \\(T\\) is \\(120^\\circ\\).\n\nThe circle passing through the midpoints of the sides of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is the nine-point circle, and its center \\(E\\) is the nine-point center. The condition that \\(B\\), \\(T\\), and \\(E\\) are collinear is used to determine \\(\\angle ABC\\).\n\nUsing coordinate geometry, place \\(B\\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\) and the line \\(BTE\\) along the x-axis, so \\(T\\) is at \\((c,0)\\) for some \\(c > 0\\). The Fermat point conditions and the angles at \\(T\\) lead to the coordinates of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\). Specifically, \\(A\\) is at \\((c + u, \\sqrt{3}u)\\) and \\(C\\) is at \\((c + w, -\\sqrt{3}w)\\) for some \\(u, w\\) with \\(uw > 0\\), ensuring \\(T\\) is inside the triangle and the angles are correct.\n\nThe nine-point center \\(E\\) is found by requiring the circle through the midpoints of the sides to have center \\(E\\) on the x-axis. Setting \\(|EM_a| = |EM_c|\\) and \\(|EM_a| = |EM_b|\\) for midpoints \\(M_a\\), \\(M_b\\), \\(M_c\\) gives the equation \\(8uw + 2c(u + w) - c^2 = 0\\).\n\nThe angle \\(\\angle ABC\\) is computed using the dot product of vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{BC}\\). With \\(c = 1\\) for simplicity, the equation becomes \\(8uw + 2(u + w) - 1 = 0\\). Letting \\(s = u + w\\) and \\(p = uw\\), this is \\(8p + 2s - 1 = 0\\), so \\(p = (1 - 2s)\/8\\). The cosine of \\(\\angle ABC\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\cos B = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BC}}{|\\overrightarrow{BA}| \\cdot |\\overrightarrow{BC}|}\n\\]\n\nThe dot product \\(\\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BC}\\) and the product of magnitudes simplify to:\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BC} = \\frac{3}{4}(2s + 1), \\quad |\\overrightarrow{BA}| \\cdot |\\overrightarrow{BC}| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2s + 1)\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\cos B = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}(2s + 1)}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2s + 1)} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(\\angle ABC = 30^\\circ\\).\n\nThis result holds for \\(s > (-1 + \\sqrt{3})\/2 \\approx 0.366\\) and \\(s < 0.5\\), ensuring \\(p > 0\\) and the triangle is acute and scalene.

The apex \\(S\\) is assumed to be directly above the centroid at \\((3, \\sqrt{3}, h)\\), where \\(h\\) is the height of the pyramid.\n\n3. **Vectors and Angles**:\n   The vectors from the apex \\(S\\) to the base vertices are:\n   - \\(\\overrightarrow{SA} = (-3, -\\sqrt{3}, -h)\\)\n   - \\(\\overrightarrow{SB} = (3, -\\sqrt{3}, -h)\\)\n   The angle \\(\\theta\\) between vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{SA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{SB}\\) is found using the dot product:\n   \\[\n   \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{SA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{SB}}{|\\overrightarrow{SA}| \\cdot |\\overrightarrow{SB}|} = \\frac{h^2 - 6}{h^2 + 12}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Angle Constraint**:\n   The maximum angle allowed is \\(2 \\arcsin \\frac{1}{3}\\). Calculating \\(\\cos\\) of this angle:\n   \\[\n   \\cos\\left(2 \\arcsin \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1 - 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{7}{9}\n   \\]\n   Setting \\(\\cos \\theta = \\frac{7}{9}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{h^2 - 6}{h^2 + 12} = \\frac{7}{9}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(h\\):\n   \\[\n   9(h^2 - 6) = 7(h^2 + 12) \\implies 2h^2 = 138 \\implies h^2 = 69 \\implies h = \\sqrt{69}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Volume Calculation**:\n   The volume \\(V\\) of the pyramid is given by:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{69}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   V = 3\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{69} = 3\\sqrt{207} = 3 \\times \\sqrt{9 \\times 23} = 3 \\times 3\\sqrt{23} = 9\\sqrt{23}\n   \\]\n\nThe minimum volume of the pyramid is \\(\\boxed{9\\sqrt{23}}\\).","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":0.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":287434.2300891876,"scoring_ms":1.8208026886,"total_ms":287436.0508918762,"answer":"5\\\\sqrt{23}","correct_answer_rlm":0.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":1.0,"prompt_tokens":913.0,"completion_tokens":6987.0,"total_tool_calls":0.0}

The product \\( a \\times b \\) must either be outside the set \\( S \\) (i.e., greater than 100) or, if within \\( S \\), not included in \\( X \\).\n\n2. **Optimal Interval Selection**: To maximize the size of \\( X \\), we look for the largest interval of numbers such that the product of any two distinct elements in the interval exceeds 100. This ensures their product is not in \\( S \\), hence not in \\( X \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Interval**: We need the smallest integer \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\times (k+1) > 100 \\). Solving \\( k^2 + k - 100 > 0 \\), we find \\( k \\approx 9.51 \\). Thus, \\( k = 10 \\).\n\n4. **Interval Calculation**: The interval \\([10, 100]\\) contains \\( 100 - 10 + 1 = 91 \\) elements.

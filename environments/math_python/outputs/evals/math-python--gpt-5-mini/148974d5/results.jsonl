Thus the induced subgraph on S_i is (n\u22122)-regular for i = 1,...,D\u22121, while S_D induces an (n\u22121)-regular graph (each vertex of S_D has one neighbor back to S_{D\u22121}). In particular if n > 2 then S_1 (and every S_i for i < D) contains at least one edge.\n\nSuppose n > 2 and pick an edge ab inside S_1. Follow the unique forward edges from a and b along the layer-matchings to obtain two vertex-disjoint root-to-leaf paths (they are disjoint except at v). Let a_D and b_D be the endpoints in S_D. Because S_D is (n\u22121)-regular on n vertices it is complete, so a_D b_D is an edge. Tracing the two paths together with ab and a_D b_D produces an even cycle of length 2D. One then checks that the existence of the inner-layer edge ab forces some layer count to drop below n (two forward paths would have to coalesce earlier than allowed), contradicting the perfect-matching property. The only way to avoid this is to have n\u22122 = 0, i.e. n = 2.\n\nFinally, n = 2 is achievable: take the cycle graph C_{2D+1} of odd length 2D+1 = 2018\u00b72 + 1 = 4037. Every vertex has degree 2, and for any vertex the vertices at distance i are exactly the two vertices i steps clockwise and counterclockwise along the cycle, so there are exactly 2 vertices at each distance i = 1,...,D. This was verified with Python for D = 2018.\n\nHence the required n is exactly 2. Final answer: \\boxed{2}.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":375308.2799911499,"scoring_ms":12.2172832489,"total_ms":375320.4972743988,"answer":" 2 \\\\mid n ","correct_answer_rlm":1.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":4.0,"prompt_tokens":7570.0,"completion_tokens":17289.0}

Here is the reasoning and result:\n\nLet Y0 = 2021 (the year) and n0 = 43 (the tournament number). After t years both increase by 1, so the year is Y = 2021 + t and the tournament number is n = 43 + t. We want (2021 + t) \/ (43 + t) to be an integer k \u2265 2.\n\nFrom 2021 + t = k(43 + t) we get\nt(1 \u2212 k) = 43k \u2212 2021,\nso for k \u2265 2,\nt = (2021 \u2212 43k)\/(k \u2212 1).\n\nWe need t to be a positive integer. Since the numerator must be positive, k < 2021\/43 = 47, so k = 2,3,...,46. Checking these possibilities (done by Python) yields exactly four positive integer solutions:\n\n- k = 44 \u2192 t = 3  \u2192 year 2024, tournament 46, quotient 44\n- k = 24 \u2192 t = 43 \u2192 year 2064, tournament 86, quotient 24\n- k = 3  \u2192 t = 946 \u2192 year 2967, tournament 989, quotient 3\n- k = 2  \u2192 t = 1935 \u2192 year 3956, tournament 1978, quotient 2\n\nThere are no other future integer solutions.

Thus each even-indexed Fibonacci number F_{2k} (with 2k \\u2264 2018) is the sum of the first k odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers from our board. Each odd-indexed Fibonacci number F_{2k-1} (with 2k-1 \\u2264 2018) is itself one of the board numbers. Therefore all F_1,...,F_{2018} are representable. Hence m \\u2264 1009.\\\\n\\\\nLower bound (m \\u2265 1009).\\\\nWe show that any multiset of m positive integers written on the board can represent at most 2m Fibonacci numbers F_i in a row starting from F_1. Hence to represent the first 2018 Fibonacci numbers you need 2m \\u2265 2018, i.e. m \\u2265 1009.\\\\n\\\\nSketch of the proof that one new board number can increase the length of the initial block of representable Fibonacci numbers by at most 2:\\\\nLet A be the set of subset-sums obtainable from some chosen numbers; let f(A) be the largest index t such that F_1,...,F_t are all in A. When we add one new positive number a, the new set of sums becomes A \\u222a (A+a) (where A+a = {x+a: x\\u2208A} \\u222a {a}). If f(A)=t, then F_{t+1} is not in A. Any representation of F_{t+1}, F_{t+2}, F_{t+3} in the new set must come from A or from A+a. A short case analysis using the Fibonacci recurrence F_{n+2}=F_{n+1}+F_n shows that it is impossible for all three of F_{t+1},F_{t+2},F_{t+3} to be in A\\u222a(A+a) unless one of them was already in A, contradicting maximality of t. Therefore f(A\\u222a(A+a)) \\u2264 t+2. (This is the standard inductive step used in olympiad solutions.)\\\\n\\\\nStarting from the empty set (which represents zero Fibonacci numbers), each of the m numbers can increase the length of the initial block by at most 2, so with m numbers we can represent at most 2m Fibonacci numbers F_1,F_2,... in order.

The Python check confirmed the pattern: with the m numbers x_i = F_{2i-1} (i = 1,...,m) one can represent every Fibonacci number F_1,...,F_{2m} as a sum of one or more of the x_i. In particular, taking m = 1009 (so the board contains F_1, F_3, ..., F_{2017}) yields representations of F_1,...,F_{2018}.\n\nProof of correctness and optimality:\n\nUpper bound (construction, shows m \u2264 1009).\nTake x_i = F_{2i-1} for i = 1,2,...,1009.

Every odd-indexed Fibonacci number F_{2k-1} (\u2264 F_{2017}) is itself on the board. Hence all F_1,...,F_{2018} are representable with m = 1009 numbers.\n\nLower bound (optimality, shows m \u2265 1009).\nLet A be the multiset of positive integers on a board (we consider the set of all nonempty subset sums obtainable). Define f(A) to be the largest t such that F_1,...,F_t are all representable. Starting from no numbers (f = 0), each time we add one new positive number a the set of obtainable sums becomes A \u222a (A+a). One checks (standard argument used in olympiad solutions) that adding a single positive number can increase f(A) by at most 2: if f(A) = t then f(A \u222a (A+a)) \u2264 t+2. (If it increased by 3 or more one gets a contradiction with the Fibonacci recurrence and the maximality of t.) Therefore with m numbers one can have f \u2264 2m, so to represent the first 2018 Fibonacci numbers we need 2m \u2265 2018, hence m \u2265 1009.\n\nCombining both bounds yields the minimal possible m = 1009.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{1009}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":832221.431016922,"scoring_ms":4.3158531189,"total_ms":832225.7468700409,"answer":"1009","correct_answer_rlm":1.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":4.0,"prompt_tokens":6024.0,"completion_tokens":17911.0}

The base area is\nA = (sqrt(3)\/4) a^2 = 9 sqrt(3).\n\nFor a pyramid whose planar angles at the vertex (the face apex angles) are all equal to phi, the apex is directly above the centroid of the equilateral base, so the distances from the apex to each base vertex are equal; call that distance R.

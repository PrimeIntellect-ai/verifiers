Each year the tournament number increases by 1, and since for n = 43 the year is 2021, in general the year for tournament n is Y = n + 1978. We observe the phenomenon when the year Y is divisible by n, i.e. n | (n + 1978), which is equivalent to n | 1978. Thus n must be a divisor of 1978.\n\nUsing Python we find the divisors of 1978 and the corresponding years Y = n + 1978:\n\n- Divisors of 1978: 1, 2, 23, 43, 46, 86, 989, 1978.\n- Corresponding years Y: 1979, 1980, 2001, 2021, 2024, 2064, 2967, 3956.\n\nThose strictly after 2021 are 2024, 2064, 2967, and 3956 \u2014 four future occasions.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{4}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":1.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":143256.1433315277,"scoring_ms":9.7703933716,"total_ms":143265.9137248993,"answer":"4","correct_answer_rlm":1.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":4.0,"prompt_tokens":6042.0,"completion_tokens":8678.0,"total_tool_calls":3.0,"repl_total_time_seconds":0.653941601,"repl_call_count":3.0,"repl_mean_time_seconds":0.2179805337}

With the last term 1\/1992 the largest s is 1+1992 = 1993, so n \u2264 floor(1993\/3) = 664. Thus 1\/2 appears 664 times.\n\nPosition formula: for a given n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 664) we have s = 3n. The number of terms before group s is (s\u22122)(s\u22121)\/2, and within the s-group the term with numerator n (denominator 2n) is the d = 2n-th element of that group. Therefore the position is\nP(n) = (s\u22122)(s\u22121)\/2 + d = (9n^2 \u2212 5n + 2)\/2.\n\nExamples: P(1) = 3, P(2) = 14, P(3) = 34, P(4) = 63, P(5) = 101. The last occurrence (n = 664) is P(664) = 1,982,373.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{1\/2\\text{ appears }664\\text{ times; its positions are }P(n)=\\frac{9n^2-5n+2}{2}\\text{ for }n=1,2,\\dots,664.}","role":"assistant","tool_calls":null}],"task":"default","reward":0.0,"error":null,"generation_ms":128759.3040466309,"scoring_ms":17.0311927795,"total_ms":128776.3352394104,"answer":"664","correct_answer_rlm":0.0,"sub_llm_call_count":0.0,"sub_llm_prompt_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_completion_tokens":0.0,"sub_llm_total_tool_calls":0.0,"sub_llm_total_turns":0.0,"sub_llm_batch_count":0.0,"sub_llm_max_batch_size":0.0,"sub_llm_mean_batch_size":0.0,"turns":5.0,"prompt_tokens":7966.0,"completion_tokens":5886.0,"total_tool_calls":4.0,"repl_total_time_seconds":2.111022544,"repl_call_count":4.0,"repl_mean_time_seconds":0.527755636}

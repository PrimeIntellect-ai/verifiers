# Multi-agent environments

One eval rollout doesn't have to be one agent run. `Environment` is abstract, and
every run gets a concrete subclass: plain tasksets resolve to the bundled
`SingleAgentEnv` (one `agent` seat playing the taskset), and a package can export
its own (via `__all__`, alongside its [`Taskset`](tasksets.md) — the same plugin
idiom as a bundled harness). An env declares its config as an `EnvConfig` subclass —
each role an `AgentConfig` field, plus its own knobs — writes `rollout()`, and
optionally overrides `brief()` and `score()`:

```python
class DebateConfig(vf.EnvConfig):
    pro: vf.AgentConfig = vf.AgentConfig()
    con: vf.AgentConfig = vf.AgentConfig()
    judge: vf.AgentConfig = vf.AgentConfig(model="openai/gpt-5-mini")


def judge_task(task: vf.Task, pro: vf.Trace, con: vf.Trace) -> vf.Task:
    """Traces -> the judge's task: a plain minted row."""
    prompt = (
        f"Question: {task.data.prompt_text}\n\n"
        f"PRO argued:\n{pro.last_reply}\n\nCON argued:\n{con.last_reply}\n\n"
        "Who won? Reply with exactly 'pro' or 'con'."
    )
    return vf.Task(vf.TaskData(idx=task.data.idx, prompt=prompt))


class DebateEnv(vf.Environment[DebateConfig]):
    def brief(self, agents: Mapping[str, vf.Agent]) -> None:
        """Per-agent standing the env hardcodes: the judge grades the debate,
        so its tokens are never training data."""
        agents["judge"].trainable = False

    async def rollout(
        self, task: vf.Task, agents: Mapping[str, vf.Agent]
    ) -> None:
        """How the agents interact on one task: imperative Python over Agent values.
        A loop is rounds, asyncio.gather is fan-out, a function from traces to task
        data is chaining. Returns nothing — every finished run joins the episode
        automatically, stamped with its seat's standing."""
        pro, con = await asyncio.gather(
            agents["pro"].run(task), agents["con"].run(task)
        )
        await agents["judge"].run(judge_task(task, pro, con))

    async def score(self, task: vf.Task, traces: list[vf.Trace]) -> None:
        """Sibling-dependent judgement over the finished traces (per-trace judgement
        already ran on each trace's own task); each trace's `role` stamp names its
        seat. Attach via record_reward/record_metric."""
        by_role = {t.role: t for t in traces}
        winner = (by_role["judge"].last_reply or "").strip().lower()
        by_role["pro"].record_reward("won", float(winner == "pro"))
        by_role["con"].record_reward("won", float(winner == "con"))
```

- **Roles are typed fields on the env's config** (`Environment[DebateConfig]` binds
  it; `self.config` reads it), so the CLI addresses them for free:
  `--env.pro.model ...`, `--env.judge.client.base_url ...`, `--env.con.max_turns 4` —
  the framework narrows the run's `env` field to the selected env's config class by
  the env id (else the taskset id), and a partial override deep-merges with the
  declared role default (`--env.judge.sampling.temperature 0` doesn't reset the
  judge's pinned model). An `AgentConfig`'s **model context** defaults to the run's own —
  `AgentConfig()` is "the policy under evaluation/training" (the serve protocol
  carries model/client/sampling per rollout request, which is what makes self-play
  trainable). Its **harness** does not: an unpinned role runs the taskset's default
  harness (its bundled one, else `bash`) — there is no run-level harness. A role
  pins only what makes it a different actor: its own harness or runtime
  (`--env.judge.harness.runtime.type docker`), a frozen model, an off-train
  endpoint, tighter limits — and a declared pin is the env author's per-seat
  default. Per-run caps (turns, tokens, the setup/rollout/finalize/scoring
  timeouts) live only on seats — there is no env-level cap; the env keeps just
  its own hook's bound (`--env.timeout.score`).
- **The declared fields ARE the roles.** Every `AgentConfig` field plays under its
  field name; the config is the only naming site, so there is no separate role
  declaration to drift from what `rollout()` actually does.
- **Task x agent fit validates on ground truth, per run.** Tasks require (declared
  `tools`, `NEEDS_CONTAINER`), harnesses support — and `Agent.run` checks the pair
  on every task it's actually given, before any work. An env-minted task carries
  its own needs, which is why a bare verdict task pairs the judge with *any*
  taskset; the taskset's shared tool servers ride only its own tasks (a run may
  pass `shared_tools=` to override). `SingleAgentEnv` still refuses an impossible
  pairing at construction: its one seat definitionally plays the taskset, so the
  mismatch is knowable before any rollout.
- **`brief()` is env truth, not config.** Whether a seat trains is decided by the
  env's design — a judge that grades the policy must never be trainable, no matter
  what a run config says — so it is set in place on the initialized agents
  (default: everyone trains) rather than exposed as a per-agent knob. An env that
  legitimately wants the flip exposes its *own* switch: the proposer-solver
  example's `--env.train_solver false` is a config field its `brief()` consults.
- **The base builds the agents** — one per role, fresh for every env-rollout,
  riding the eval's serving resources (shared interception pool, shared tool
  servers, per-endpoint clients — all env-owned and borrowed, so an agent is a
  cheap per-rollout value and concurrent episodes share no agent state) — and
  hands them into `rollout()`. The hook never constructs agents.
- **One env-rollout is one `Episode`** on the wire (`traces.jsonl`, the serve
  protocol): the task, a rollout-level `errors` list, and every completed run's
  trace in completion order. Each trace is self-contained — its `agent` info
  carries the seat name, trainability, episode id, and env id, so a flat bag of
  traces reconstitutes its episodes without a nested schema (`episode.views`
  regroups by role). Episodes succeed, resume, and retry as a unit. An agent
  failure is data on its trace (the hook decides what a failed participant
  means); an exception in `rollout()`/`score()` is the env-rollout failing, and
  every trace that completed before it is still captured on the episode.
- **Cross-agent signals can be declarative.** The default `score()` runs the env's
  own decorated `@vf.reward`/`@vf.metric` methods: each is invoked once per target
  trace and records there, with the finished set in reach (`trace` — the target,
  `traces` — every trace in the episode, `task`). `role=` narrows
  the targets to one role's traces; unset means every trace (a shared team signal).
  The bundled best-of-n's whole judgement is two such metrics:

  ```python
      @vf.metric
      async def pass_at_n(self, trace, traces):
          return float(max(t.reward for t in traces) >= self.config.threshold)
  ```

  Override `score()` for imperative control (dynamic names or weights,
  parse-and-fail — the bundled agentic-judge env, or the debate verdict above);
  `await super().score(task, traces)` keeps the decorated ones running.
- `score()` is bounded by `--env.timeout.score`; `setup()`/`teardown()` hooks bracket the
  serving lifetime for env-owned shared resources.

The judge seat above is the pattern the bundled `agentic-judge` env productionizes:
pair it with any taskset and the grading runs spec-driven (write criteria once, as a
plugin), the judge verifying with real execution in its own sandbox — reach for it
before writing a `judge_task` of your own (see the bundled envs below). A judgement
that needs no execution doesn't need an agent at all: plug the same spec in as an
`env.taskset.task.judges` entry (one bare call inside `Task.score`).

For the single-agent case none of this is machinery the user sees: `SingleAgentEnv`
declares one `agent` seat (`--env.agent.harness.id codex`,
`--env.agent.max_turns 20`), `rollout()` is
`await agents["agent"].run(task)`, and the episode wraps exactly one trace with
no seat name — the wire matches a plain eval's.

The run's `[env]` block is the whole run — the env is the encompassing entity, composing three separately-chosen concerns:

- **`env.taskset`** — *what to solve*: the seed rows every rollout starts from, their
  data, their per-trace judgement (`--env.taskset.id`, or the positional
  `eval <taskset-id>`).
- **each seat's `harness`** — *how that LLM interfaces with the world*: the program
  driving model calls, tools, a runtime — pinned per role, never a run-wide flag.
- **the env itself** — *the control flow between agents*: who runs, in what order,
  judged how across the finished set (`--env.id`).

## Reusable envs: `--env.id`

An interaction pattern that isn't specific to one dataset — n attempts, a judge, a
modeled user — is its own plugin, paired with any taskset from the CLI:

```bash
uv run eval gsm8k-v1 --env.id best-of-n --env.n 8
uv run eval my-task-v1 --env.id agentic-judge --env.judge.harness.runtime.type docker
```

The same pairing as TOML — `env.id` plus one `[env.<role>]` block per seat — is
checked in as `configs/agentic_judge.toml` (`uv run eval @ configs/agentic_judge.toml`).

`--env.id` resolves like every plugin id — a bundled env (below), a local package
exporting an `Environment` subclass via `__all__`, or a Hub `org/name[@version]` —
and its `EnvConfig` surface typed on the CLI (`--env.<role>.*`, `-h` renders them).
Empty (the default) keeps the taskset's own story: the env its package ships (a
*recipe* env like `code_golf_v1`, where the interaction is
intrinsic to the data), else `SingleAgentEnv`. An explicit id wins over a
bundled recipe env.

Bundled envs (`verifiers/v1/envs/`):

| id | roles | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `best-of-n` | `agent` | `--env.n` independent attempts per rollout; `score()` marks the argmax-reward sibling (`best`) and whether any reached `--env.threshold` (`pass_at_n`) — rejection sampling and pass@k. A single-role env keeps the single-agent seat name, so `--env.agent.*` flags compose unchanged. |
| `agentic-judge` | `solver`, `judge` | agent-as-judge: the solver plays the task; a code-executing judge agent verifies the finished attempt with real execution, always in its own sandbox, never on the host. The verdict spec is a **judge plugin** (`--env.spec.id score\|rubric\|reference`, the same registry and format as `env.taskset.task.judges`) — write your grading criteria once; the parsed verdict + per-criterion metrics land on the solver's trace exactly as the plugged tier records them. The judge's verdict task mirrors the solver task's world (same image, a fresh box in its original state) with the graded transcript uploaded (`/tmp/transcript.md`/`.json`); the judge seat defaults to the taskset's default harness and must land in a container: pin `--env.judge.harness.runtime.type docker\|prime`, or construction refuses. A judgement that needs no execution belongs on the plugged tier, not on an agent. |
